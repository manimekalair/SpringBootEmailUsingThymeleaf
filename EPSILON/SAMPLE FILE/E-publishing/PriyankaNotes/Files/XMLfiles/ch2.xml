<p>With regard to their introductions, early twenty-first-century editors of scholarly editions confront conflicting demands, and they must assess the desirability or proportionality of those demands with an eye to the particu -larities of the text and author on which they have focused. No one size fits all; nor in all likelihood will any one introduction please all, at least not all equally.</p>
<p>Given early twenty-first century emphasis on the history of the book, which encompasses but also expands and revises twentieth-century bibliography, editors often devote considerable space to the immediate circumstances of the work&#x2019;s material production. Especially in the case of a work that developed in a number of distinctive stages, they may characterise the intricacies of the various manuscript and print instantiations of the text, for instance scribal habits or stop-press corrections. But introductions should also integrate the insights of a more sociological bibliography that warns against over confidence in the conclusions that supposed patterns &#x2013; for instance, the habits of individual compositors &#x2013; have tended to prompt. What is more, introducers will want to articulate and contextualise the various intentions and purposes that this developing work came to embody over the course of its manuscript and print transformations. The stress that editors place on the dynamism or permutations of a work&#x2019;s production will have to gauge the extent to which agents other than the author played significant roles in the generation of the work&#x2019;s meanings.</p>
<p>If, however, the edition aims to prove more broadly significant beyond the material history of its work, editors will participate in a rhetorically inflected intellectual history that has thrived in scholarship from the close of the twentieth century onward. With the work&#x2019;s nodal concepts and terms read as inextricable from the rhetorical texts in which they are embodied, it should prove difficult to determine whether an edition belongs in the literary or historical (or indeed classical, theological, philosophical, or political) shelves of a university library. The borderland between the literary and the ideational can also be fruitfully explored if editors illuminate the work&#x2019;s genre(s), including their principal affiliations but also their hybrid or mixed genres. To be sure, introductions can tighten their scope by following the author&#x2019;s own leads in tracing the intellectual and literary legacies that contributed to the
<target target-type="page" id="page_64"/>formulation of the work&#x2019;s ideas, genres, and styles. But they may also move forward in time by situating the work within a longer history, including its reception, imitation, and transformation over the centuries.</p>
<p>Key factors determining the emphasis that editors stress in their intro -ductions include any particular gaps in previous editorial scholarship. A good example can be found in the case of Robert Herrick; in their introduction to the 2013 edition of Herrick&#x2019;s poetry, Tom Cain and Ruth Connolly offer a sorely needed biography of the author and an unprece dentedly careful account of the material conditions of Herrick&#x2019;s only book, the 1648 <italic>Hesperides</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> With especially complex works, editors will always have to sacrifice some feature: for instance, the 2012 Oxford University Press edition of Milton&#x2019;s <italic>De doctrina christiana</italic> impresses with its multilingual engage ment with specific versions of the Bible and Reformation theology, but it arguably underplays Milton&#x2019;s heterodox ideas such as anti-trinitarianism, perhaps because those issues have been discussed so thoroughly in prior scholarship.</p>
<p>A few examples will illustrate the competing desiderata that editors must negotiate. In an edition of Lucy Hutchinson&#x2019;s translation of Roman Epicurean poet Lucretius, David Norbrook scrutinised the translator&#x2019;s use of a particular edition of that Latin poet, the 1631 <italic>Pareus</italic>. This focus is crucial for demon -strating how the provenance, text, and apparatuses of a particular edition can play a vital role in the complex encounter between Christian translator and what she considers in some measure an &#x2018;atheistic&#x2019; poem. But the Hutchinson Lucretius also required that Norbrook take a wider view, surveying the trans -mission of Epicurean philosophy, the powerful imagery of the Latin poem, and the position of the female author in early modern England.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_2"><sup>2</sup></xref> In the first volume of the Oxford edition of <italic>John Ford</italic> (2012), editors Gilles Monsarrat, Brian Vickers, and R.J.C Watt have to take into account that the volume&#x2019;s non-dramatic works are simply less well known than Ford&#x2019;s tragedies such as <italic>&#x2018;Tis Pity She&#x2019;s a Whore</italic>. Beginning with a preface that surveys the earlier history of editing Ford, the editors follow with a general introduction that divides into two parts: a study of kinds, rhetorical modes, occasions, matura tion, and relationship to the plays to be edited in future volumes; and a much-needed biographical study of Ford&#x2019;s early years. Then specific introductions to each work (positioned prior to the work) take up more elaborately matters of occasion, theme, rhetorical figures, and genre as well as offering the textual introduction.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_3"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
<p>Multi-volume editions often showcase an organisational principle to which introductions speak. In the case of David Colclough&#x2019;s edition of <italic>Donne&#x2019;s Sermons to the Court of Charles I</italic> (2013), a volume in the Oxford edition of the complete sermons, the editor&#x2019;s introduction is principally guided by the organising concept of the whole, which focuses on the different audiences to which Donne preached. To this end, the editor appropriately begins with the immediate circumstances of the sermons, then explains Donne&#x2019;s role as court chaplain and the court setting itself, afterwards turning to the texts themselves, including form and style followed by doctrine. After this helpful balance of circumstance, literary analysis, and theological exposition, we are offered a brief synopsis of what to look for in the commentary; then the textual introduction;
<target target-type="page" id="page_65"/>and two useful appendices: Charles&#x2019;s rules of decorum for chapel royal; and the calendar for all Donne&#x2019;s sermons from this period 1625&#x2013;31.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_4"><sup>4</sup></xref> Finally the editor clarifies the principles and conventions of the edition. Also efficient and nicely balanced is the first volume of Robert Burton&#x2019;s <italic>Anatomy of Melancholy</italic> for Oxford&#x2019;s multi-volume edition (1989&#x2013;2000): the general introduction starts with biography before homing in on the concept of melancholy and what distinguishes Burton&#x2019;s construction of the disease. After a brief look at Burton&#x2019;s style, the introduction expeditiously assists readers with questions of genre and persona. A separate textual introduction explains why the copy-text is 1632 rather than 1638.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_5"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
<p>Some introductions succeed especially well at evoking dimensions of an author&#x2019;s work that have been occluded over the centuries. A good example is P.G. Stanwood&#x2019;s edition of Jeremy Taylor&#x2019;s <italic>Holy Living and Holy Dying</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_6"><sup>6</sup></xref> In addition to a survey of the devotional tradition to which the works belong, of Taylor&#x2019;s chief sources but also his style and the reception of the works, Stanwood includes an overview of Taylor&#x2019;s career that reminds us just how controversial his ideas were in their own time: for example, Taylor&#x2019;s denial that salvation could be acquired in the event of a repentant deathbed scene. Graham Rees&#x2019;s introduction to <italic>The Instauratio Magna <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter2">Chapter 2</xref>: Novum Organum and Associated Texts</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_7"><sup>7</sup></xref> offers an extraordinarily capacious, widely ranging, and even impassioned introduction to Bacon&#x2019;s massive project: the introduction is equally full on the ideational and bibliographical levels, in the first offering an extensive explanation of the preliminaries of the <italic>Novum Organum</italic> (in which Bacon sets forth the basic dimensions of his scheme), of the <italic>Novum Organum</italic> itself (including an extensive study of the most neglected features of B&#x2019;s inductive method in book 2). But the introduction has a much wider lens as well, surveying Bacon&#x2019;s reception specifically as a scientist of originality and significance over the centuries. Having examined (and defended) Bacon&#x2019;s sci -entific programme at both a local (textual) and trans-historical fashion, Rees shifts to reconstructing with considerable bibliographical sophistication the very unusual, perhaps unprecedented, method by which the King&#x2019;s Printers pro duced the 1620 volume (a matter having to do with the use of eight skeletons). On the whole, the <italic>Oxford Francis Bacon</italic> is positioned to give us a decidedly different Bacon from the one that the Victorians thought they understood.</p>
<p>When it comes to editions of manuscripts and scribal publications, editors often find that simply no ready precedent or formula exists as a template for their introductory priorities. This is certainly the case with Kate Bennett&#x2019;s two-volume edition of John Aubrey&#x2019;s <italic>Brief Lives</italic>, which devotes considerable space to redefining the essential properties of Aubrey&#x2019;s social, historical, and bio -graphical enterprise and, in doing so, wholly transforms the image of Aubrey that has come down from a scholarly tradition of trivialisation. By choosing first to take us to the heart of Aubrey&#x2019;s mentality and concerns, Bennett motivates her readers to expend the necessary energy to grapple with a highly complicated set of manuscripts.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_8"><sup>8</sup></xref> In their edition of language theorist and utopian writer Francis Lodwick, Felicity Henderson and William Poole appro -priately begin with a substantial biography, then guide readers into the complex intellectual fields of artificial language and religious heterodoxy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_9"><sup>9</sup></xref>
<target target-type="page" id="page_66"/>In an edition of a 1630s manuscript called <italic>The Pilgrim</italic>, Kathryn Walls also aptly tells us about its author William Baspoole, then about the medieval sources that he is recasting and politicising before turning to the literary features of the work.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_10"><sup>10</sup></xref> By contrast, Alan Stewart has little need to tell the life story of Francis Bacon in his edition of Bacon&#x2019;s earliest writings (Oxford, 2012). Rather, Stewart grapples with three problems of special concern for this particular edition: what in fact it means to attribute these works to Bacon, since some (for example) are composed as though they were written by others; why we should attend to these literary forms (for instance, legal arguments) even though they differ so much from Bacon&#x2019;s famous philosophical works; and what we stand to learn about those later works from a careful consideration of what others have taken to be irrelevant to Bacon&#x2019;s mature philosophy. Beyond the general introduction, Stewart prefaces each piece of this diverse material with its own intro duction. Some manuscript editions must reckon with the miscellaneous and anonymous qualities of the contents, but others, includ -ing an edition of the <italic>Letterbooks</italic> of John Evelyn, must justify the selectivity of the edition &#x2013; why, that is, it is useful to have a new edition of just some of Evelyn&#x2019;s letters. Having quickly summed Evelyn&#x2019;s well-known life and works, Douglas D.C. Chambers and David Galbraith clarify the significance of the letter books to Evelyn&#x2019;s diary and other correspondence, not least as they testify to his changing religious and political views. The editors also characterise the tone among other literary effects of these missives before tracing the epistolary genre, its classical models, and the social-cultural significance of letters in the period.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_11"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
<p>From these few examples, it should be clear that editors confront a spate of questions when deciding what to foreground in their introductions, together with what audiences they are most intent on serving. When push comes to introductory shove, what matters most: the finer points of the material con -ditions of the text? The rationale for representing those con ditions as the editors have done? The rhetorical and conceptual dimensions of the work, both as they contributed to the culture of the times and as they continue to fascinate readers today? The facts about an author&#x2019;s life, especially if that life has been hitherto negligently uncovered? And how does an editor speak to the various audiences that might want guidance before they undertake the work &#x2013; the advanced or precocious student; a historian or literary scholar whose own work dovetails with a particular feature of the work; the specialist in the literary and intellec -tual culture of the work&#x2019;s period; the specialist in that particular author; and the specialist in bibliography? Should introductions make a case, even passionately, for the significance of a work or set of works? Or is it better scrupulously to explain what and why the editors have done what they have done while leaving readers to decide whether the content of the edition is worth their attention?</p>
<p>In our forthcoming edition of Sir Thomas Browne&#x2019;s <italic>Religio Medici</italic>, Brooke Conti and I feature a sizeable account of three matters: the ideas in the work; its genres and styles; and (as a consequence of its ideas, genres, and styles) its volatile reception from the moment of its birth. As volume one in a multi-volume edition, we are tasked with providing some account of Browne&#x2019;s early life but
<target target-type="page" id="page_67"/>also with anticipating <italic>Religio Medici</italic>&#x2019;s relationship to works that Browne would write later. Yet we ask our readers to consider these ideational, literary, and historical matters within a highly specific and complex set of textual circum -stances: at least three distinctive phases in the composition of a work that Browne understood to be flexible and change able; eight extant manuscripts &#x2013; none holograph &#x2013; with thousands of variants among them and with clear signs that no small number of manuscripts has been lost; and an early print history that begins with two unauthorised editions in which Browne expresses deep dissatisfaction even as he uses the same publisher, Andrew Crooke, for his authorised edition. As with Kate Bennett&#x2019;s Aubrey (4.2), we have to convince our readers that <italic>Religio Medici</italic> is certainly worth the considerable energy that they will have to exert not just in navigating this notoriously difficult text but in doing so thrice over.</p>

<title>The role and extent of annotations</title>
<p>The act of writing explanatory notes for a text is one of the great joys of scholarly editing. If presenting the text requires care to allow the text to speak for itself, annotation allows the editor to interpret, to comment, to highlight, and to contextualise: that is, to bring his/her scholarship to bear on the text, to act as a guide for the reader, and to demonstrate the text&#x2019;s significance and worth. Along with the introduction, annotations are the place where an argument can be constructed about the text&#x2019;s meaning &#x2013; perhaps not overtly, but through choice of material to be annotated and content of notes. Thus, annotation is not a straightforward or routine task &#x2013; there are choices to be made at every stage. Editors should be aware of this, and should keep in mind their aspirations for the edition when planning their annotations.</p>
<p>Like most other aspects of the scholarly edition, annotation practices should reflect the intended audience for the volume. An edition intended for an undergraduate readership will require annotation that is more extensive than, and different from, annotation in a volume aimed at a more specialist audience. You may also want to think about whether your edition will attract a more general non-academic readership. Editors should not assume that all academic audiences are equal: a text that may be of interest to scholars from a number of different fields may require a greater amount of annotation than one that is located more squarely in the canon of a particular discipline, simply because knowledge that is common among (for example) historians of architecture may not be as generally well known to literary scholars, and vice versa.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_68"/>So, the first task of an annotator is to decide how much, and what kind of, extra commentary needs to be provided. Clearly, some texts will require many more notes than others, depending on the obscurity or difficulty of the text. An <italic>editio princeps</italic> presents the editor with (perhaps) a slightly more straight -forward task, in that the text itself can dictate the amount of annotation. An editor working on material for which there is a long critical heritage and a number of previous scholarly editions will already have con sidered the overall rationale for a new publication, which may of course include providing a higher standard of annotation. In this case, the editor will need to decide how to position her/his edition in terms of the critical heritage, and this also applies to annotation. There will undoubtedly be points at which he/she wishes to disagree with previous editors, and parts of the text that have been heavily annotated in the past will probably need some comment in the new edition (see 2.5.3 and 4.5).</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of annotation: interpretative, clarifying the text&#x2019;s meaning; and informative, providing additional factual informa tion. Interpretative annotations can do one of a number of things: gloss an unusual or archaic word or phrase, provide a reading for a section of text if the meaning is unclear, or attempt to explain a lacuna or textual crux (or alternatively, admit to editorial bafflement). Informative annotations can provide a range of extra detail: further information about people, places, and events; notes on literary and historical context; and references directing the reader to relevant secondary sources. When deciding what to annotate, editors should be aware of their own prejudices and interests, and decide how far these align with the rationale for the edition &#x2013; it may be that they need to be guarded against. For example, a bibliographer or material culture specialist may automatically annotate every mention of a book or descrip tion of material goods in a particular text, but inadvertently provide patchier coverage for references to other spheres of activity. If the text is aimed at like-minded scholars then this may not be a cause for concern, because it may be that the rationale behind editing the text in the first place is to provide a detailed new source for one particular research area. However, if the text is likely to be used by scholars from a range of fields then the notes should give similarly detailed information about other features. A good edition will be consistent in its annotation: for example, if birth and death dates are given for some of the individuals mentioned in the text then they should ideally be provided for all the individuals mentioned, unless there is a good reason to prioritise a sub-set.</p>
<p>This prompts the question of whether, and how, to acknowledge a lack of further information. In the case of birth and death dates, for example, it is very likely that it will not be possible to identify all the people mentioned in the text. One option would be to signal this with a brief note keyed to names as they occur in the text, although this would soon become tedious if too many individuals could not be identified. Unless there is a particular reason to comment on specific cases, it is probably more appropriate to tackle this problem by making a general statement in the introduction, where historio -graphical methods can be discussed briefly so that the reader is aware of the sources that have been canvassed in the attempt to identify indi viduals. It is
<target target-type="page" id="page_69"/>then perfectly legitimate to state that in cases where no further information is given, it is because none is available.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Annotation in practice</title>
<p>When embarking on any printed edition, a number of practical decisions need to be made about annotations. Where will they be printed? How will they be formatted? To a certain extent, location will be dictated by the overall layout of the volume and possibly the publisher&#x2019;s preferred format, but it will probably be either as footnotes or endnotes (or for larger projects, the notes might be printed in a separate volume). Longer and more complex annotations may detract from the readability of the main text if printed on the same page; on the other hand, keeping annotations visible with the text can assist readers, particularly if the annotations are mainly interpretative (as, for example, in an edition of Shakespeare aimed at an undergraduate audience). These problems are perhaps less pressing in the case of an electronic edition, although editors still need to keep in mind basic questions about how annotations are accessed, and how they are indicated in the text.</p>
<p>Individual annotations should be keyed to points in the text. If the notes are to be printed on the same page as the text, a line number may be sufficient to indicate what the note refers to. If the notes are printed elsewhere, it is more common to provide both lineation (or pagination) and a lemma &#x2013; that is, the word or phrase from the text which is the subject of the annotation. Phrases may be abbreviated with ellipses to save space.</p>
<p>On the whole, editors should strive to avoid repetition in annotations just as they would elsewhere in their writing. There may of course be cases where cross-referencing is required, if the text returns to similar themes or topics several times. In this case, annotations can usefully indicate running themes or recurring ideas. However, if exactly the same material requiring annotation crops up more than once or twice (for example, if a dialect word is used throughout the text, or if an individual is mentioned frequently) then the editor should think about different ways to approach the task of providing a gloss or extra information. In a printed edition, one solution might be to include a separate biographical (or other type of) index, or a glossary, at the end of the text. This has the added advantage of presenting a set of similar material (dialect words, for example) in a format where it can be easily accessed instead of scattered throughout the text, possibly allowing a more fruitful analysis for readers. It should also save space, in that individual annotations are no longer required. A potential drawback to this method is that readers who merely dip into the volume and are unaware of the existence of the biographical index or glossary may not access the notes; ensuring keywords are included in the main index to the volume should reduce this problem.</p>
<p>The annotations should also work in conjunction with the main intro -duction to the text. If there is recurring material that needs annotation then it probably warrants some discussion in the introduction, to alert the reader to a potentially significant aspect of the text. The editor can also give an overview of the working methods that have underpinned her/his edition; as mentioned
<target target-type="page" id="page_70"/>above, this can give context to the contents of the annotations by indicating which research avenues have already been explored. It is also an opportunity to describe boundaries for the kind of extra information that has been provided in annotations. The opportunities for commentary are limitless, but editors are bound by time and space. There is also a point at which encyclopaedic annota -tion takes over the main text, making the edition unwieldy and potentially unreadable. Editors should not feel that they need to provide the last word in scholarship on their text &#x2013; rather, annotations should invite readers to explore further.</p>

<p>Although the focus of most scholarly editions will be on the text, editors should not ignore the many non-textual elements that may be present in printed or manuscript works. The work of scholars in the fields of book history and material culture has prompted a new interest in images them selves, and in the relationships between text and image, and the role of images in producing meaning in the text. Although protocols for editing images are perhaps not as well established as those dealing with textual issues, this essay will outline some basic questions that editors should consider when dealing with non-textual material.</p>
<p>A surprisingly large number of print and manuscript works include nontextual features, and these should be identified at the outset of an editing project. Broad categories include (but are not limited to) illustrated title-pages, frontispieces, printers&#x2019; devices, diagrams, illustrations, maps, and symbols. Any text may include a combination of these categories, but decisions about how to treat them in the scholarly edition should probably be made on a case-by-case basis: that is, an in-text diagram might be treated differently from a printer&#x2019;s device or a full-page illustration. None of this material should be ignored, even if it initially appears not to be central to the point of the edition. The small woodcuts used by seventeenth-century printers as ornaments, for example, can sometimes help to identify pub lishers where no information has been given; the same woodcuts appearing in several different publications would suggest they were produced by the same printer.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_12"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
<p>Regardless of how you plan to treat them in the final edition, each of these non-textual aspects deserves some editorial comment, and if there is a signifi -cant amount of non-textual material then it may be worthwhile devoting a section of the introduction to its discussion. What needs to be said? Basic information should be provided about size (including the size of the plate, if this can be determined), placement and orientation on the page of the copy-text,
<target target-type="page" id="page_71"/>or position if an illustration has been printed on a separate sheet and bound into the volume. You should identify the process that has been used to produce the image (for example, pencil or ink sketch; woodcut, engraving, etching or mezzotint print, etc.), and note whether coloured ink has been used. If possible, you should also try to identify the artist, and, in the case of prints, the engraver, although this is often impossible unless the illustration has been signed or there is evidence from another source. Finally, as with any other aspect of the text, you should comment on the function of the non-textual elements and their significance in terms of the interpretation of the text as a whole.</p>
<p>This may sound daunting to those who have not previously worked with images, but there are a number of very helpful resources available. Ludmilla Jordanova&#x2019;s <italic>The Look of the Past: Visual and Material Evidence in Historical Practice</italic> (Cambridge University Press, 2012) gives a useful introduction to the field and the types of questions scholars can ask of images, which in turn gives a good indication of the information that should be included in the edition. The <italic>British Printed Images to 1700</italic> database (<uri>www.bpi1700.org.uk</uri>) contains thousands of book illustrations and prints from early modern Britain and can be searched by subject matter and by artist or engraver. The site also has a resources section providing a brief overview of print techniques and history, and a very useful list of sources for further reading. The essays in the accom -panying volume <italic>Printed Images in Early Modern Britain</italic> (London: Routledge, 2010) edited by Michael Hunter analyse a wide range of printed images. The <italic>Broadside Ballads Online</italic> website (<uri>www.ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk</uri>) lists images from ballads by subject heading, and has also developed an image-matching search function in order to find multiple instances of the same ballad-illustrations. Finally, for the more technical aspects Antony Griffiths&#x2019;s <italic>Prints and Print making: An Introduction to the History and Techniques 2nd edn</italic> (London: British Museum, 1996) and Bamber Gascoigne&#x2019;s <italic>How to Identify Prints: A Complete Guide to Manual and Mechanical Processes from Woodcut to Inkjet 2nd edn</italic> (London: Thames and Hudson, 2004) provide invaluable introductions to printmaking techniques.</p>
<p>Part of the work of a scholarly edition is to present the reader with inform -ation about different iterations of a text; similarly, any changes to the nontextual elements should be noted. In rare cases, the original draw ings that formed the basis of engraved plates are still extant. In this case the edition should (at the very least) provide a written comparison of the originals to the printed version(s), including an explanation for any differ ences that are apparent. Ideally images of both the original drawing and the engraved plate would also be reproduced within the edition. Perhaps more commonly, a printed edition may include illustrations that exist in more than one state, whether because of damage to a plate or block, or through deliber ate revision. The edition should provide a research-based comparison of non-textual elements and schedule this into the programme of work, as is already done with the collation of the text; with non-textual material too, any differ ences should be noted and, where possible, contextualised. In some cases, this will be of major significance. For example, William Huddesford&#x2019;s 1760 updated edition
<target target-type="page" id="page_72"/>of Edward Lhuyd&#x2019;s <italic>Lithophylacii Britannici ichnographia</italic> (1699) included reworked plates in which Huddesford corrected illustra tions by, for example, removing images that were no longer wanted because they presented objects that had been incorrectly classified by the original author.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_13"><sup>13</sup></xref> In such an extreme case, both versions of the plate should ideally be included in the edition unless the changes can be clearly explained.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Editorial treatment of images</title>
<p>As with other aspects of preparing a scholarly edition, it is certainly worthwhile inspecting recent volumes in similar fields produced by quality presses in order to see how other editors have approached the task of editing images. Your intentions should be included in the initial proposal for the edition and should probably also be discussed with the commissioning editor of a printed volume, in order to make sure the press is willing and able to accommodate your preferences. You should aim to ensure that the publisher will provide a decent quality of reproduction, with the use of colour plates if necessary. It is also worthwhile discussing positioning within the text &#x2013; will there be a section of full-page plates, or can illustrations be distributed through the volume? Find out the publisher&#x2019;s preferred file format and the resolution required for digital images, as this information will need to be provided when you make your institutional image requests. You will also usually need to give the image supplier information about the intended print run and distribution of the edition; or in the case of a digital edition, information about hosting arrange -ments and intended duration for the display of the image. When planning your edition be aware that it may take some time to organise permission to repro -duce images, and you will often need to pay a licence or reproduction fee, so it will be prudent to begin the process well in advance, and think about how reproductions might be funded, perhaps by applying for a small publication grant from a learned society or similar.</p>
<p>Most illustrative material can be dealt with straightforwardly by reprinting it in facsimile, either on a separate page or incorporated into the text. In either case, editors should note any deviations from the layout in the original manuscript or printed volume. There may, however, be circumstances under which a case could be made for editorial intervention in non-textual material. Just as a print or manuscript text can contain errors, corrections, deletions, or insertions, images and symbols can also be defective or can bear witness to authorial alterations. Obviously the key difference is that whereas it is often clear what a defective text should have said (in the case of a typographical or scribal error, for example), it is usually not clear what an image should have looked like even where the editor is reasonably certain that the version in front of him/her is defective. Editorial emendation of images, then, should be approached with even more caution than emendation of text. What type of situation might warrant editorial intervention? A broken or damaged block might produce a print with a white line running through it (where the wood -block had not picked up any ink); this could possibly be corrected through
<target target-type="page" id="page_73"/>manipulation of the digital image. If, for example, sections of a diagram in a manuscript treatise had been crossed through and this seemed to be an authorial correction, you may choose to erase these sections when reproducing the image in the main text of your edition so that the authorially sanctioned version accompanied the printed text. If the text described a particular image very clearly and yet the printed version of the image did not match the description, an editor could emend the image if there was no doubt about what had been intended. For instance, the characters invented by early language-theorist Francis Lodwick and printed in his <italic>A Common Writing</italic> ([London], 1647) followed a pattern explained in Lodwick&#x2019;s text and could thus be emended if necessary (<italic>On Language</italic>, 81&#x2013;7). Of course in each of these cases the editor would need to indicate any interventions in the apparatus, just as editorial changes to the text would be indicated, and the uncorrected versions should also be printed.</p>

<p>My title may appear to some (though perhaps not to textual editors) to bring together two unlikely concepts, concepts which really require the inter position of some cancelling negative. Textual editors, however, may feel differently. The textual apparatus of a scholarly edition almost certainly accounts for a large proportion of the editor&#x2019;s labour and thought, and is likely to represent the core of intellectual engagement with the project. It may also hold the key to much of the new insight that a major edition has to offer; and it will almost certainly supersede, in important respects, the accounts in standard bibliographies. In comparison with the exacting and enormous labour of identifying, locating, describing, and collating the witnesses to the literary work, and recording the results in an accurate and consistent form, the subsequent annotation of the text and the writing of general introductions will often prove relatively straightforward. These more contextual and discursive elements not only build on specific insights from the analysis of the textual transmission, but also draw more generally on the inwardness with the work that results from methodical scrutiny of every word, phrase, and punctuation mark through successive rounds of collation and proofing.</p>
<p>Having done this textual work and experienced its benefits to under standing and interpretation, we presumably desire, as editors, to share it with our readers. Yet the ways in which we do so are determined not only by longstanding editorial conventions, but also by the editorial guidelines and series
<target target-type="page" id="page_74"/>policies of publishers and general editors. In the process, we produce a textual apparatus that is likely to be the least-consulted part of the entire book. Usually we start with such elements as quasi-facsimile title page transcription, the collation formula that summarises the physical structure of the copy-text, a summary of the items contained in it, an itemisation of its catchwords not catching, and an analysis of specific extant copies in relation to each other and to existing author bibliographies. Then there are various lists and tables to be elaborated, typically including a list of emendations made by the editor and the reasons for them, and a historical collation of the variants between the copy-text and one or more other texts. There may also be lists that detail how hyphenated words at line-ends in the copy-text have been treated in the reading text, and how hyphenated words at line-ends in the reading text should be treated by users transcrib ing from that text. Much of this is of limited appeal, to put it mildly: the analysis of individual copies is meaningful only to those who have handled comparable books themselves; and some at least of the data included in emendations and textual variants might be dismissed by an unsympathetic reader as merely trivial. Most readers, however, will never get as far as making that judgement, because the traditional presentations of the information are effectively opaque to them.</p>
<p>So it is not surprising that readers tend to focus instead on the reading text, explanatory notes, and general introductions. As editors, though, we know that our reading text may differ rather little from other available texts, and that the new insights we have to offer are inseparable from our analysis of the textual transmission &#x2013; which is now hidden at the back of the book or fenced off at the foot of the page or waiting to be revealed by clicking through or calling up an alternative text from within an electronic archive. My experience of editing Jonathan Swift&#x2019;s <italic>Directions to Servants</italic> is a case in point. This is a work that Swift conceived relatively early (we first hear of it in 1731); but it was in the end the last major work sent to press in his lifetime, and was published just after his death in 1745.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_14"><sup>14</sup></xref> His memory was failing in these last years, and the work remains unfinished: the textual witnesses comprise two differently incomplete authorially altered manu scripts, and several posthumous printed texts descending from the first edition of 1745 (my copy-text), which presents material not present in either manuscript (730&#x2013;1).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_15"><sup>15</sup></xref> In a further twist, when Herbert Davis examined the newly identified Rothschild manuscript during his work on his own edition (published in 1959), he realised that some alterations that Swift had made in that manuscript had been adopted into the print transmission for the first time in a reprint issued several years after his death.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_16"><sup>16</sup></xref></p>
<p>Having worked through the often bewildering witnesses to the work, in the end I produced a reading text for vol. II of <italic>The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Jonathan Swift</italic> which turned out to be very much like Davis&#x2019;s; and it may on the face of it be hard to see how the establishment of a new text so like the old has advanced understanding. My historical collation, however, is very different from Davis&#x2019;s, insofar as it displays not only discrete verbal variants, but also the internal reorderings and alterations that reveal Swift&#x2019;s ineffectual attempts to prepare the work for the press.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_17"><sup>17</sup></xref> This admittedly makes for a very
<target target-type="page" id="page_75"/>bulky textual apparatus; but it also offers users a new understanding of the processes that underlie the strangeness of the reading text, which varies between marvellously developed satirical sequences and pages of one-sentence paragraphs that lead nowhere. The material confusion of these manuscripts puts us intimately in touch with Swift&#x2019;s efforts to complete a long-meditated work in the face of failing mental powers, as he makes unavailing attempts at coherence by marking up sections for potential transposition or deletion. A different attempt to order the material by radical regrouping and the use of different founts (&#x2018;Add the directions without reason at the end, in a different letter&#x2019;) would come to light only much later, in a fragment that Sir Walter Scott printed in a footnote to his edition of 1824.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_18"><sup>18</sup></xref> This late-appearing fragment, not included by Davis but now restored to the &#x2018;Associated Materials&#x2019; section of vol. II of the <italic>Cambridge Swift</italic>, gives another poignant insight into the contingent and incomplete state of the published texts.</p>
<p>Such analysis inevitably enriches and qualifies the editor&#x2019;s perspective on the work; but once any reading text appears in a published edition it takes on, for many readers, the finality of a reified existence. So it is a major challenge for editors to make the textual core of our engagement accessible and interesting to readers. In this light, three questions spring to mind: how do we present textual apparatus? How do we use the material that it contains in our annotation of the reading text? And how, beyond the edition itself, do we conceive the big books about authors and canons that shape the discipline of literary studies?</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Textual apparatus</title>
<p>If we are working within a multi-volume edition or within a uniform series, our general or series editors typically tell us exactly what systems of repre -sentation to follow in our textual apparatus; but where as editors we have free rein to design our own apparatus, could we at least consider the possibility of minimising symbols and abbreviations? Might it sometimes be better to present a longer, more accessible account than a miracle of compaction from which the untrained eye recoils? As part of this, is it perhaps time to reconsider whether quasi-facsimile title page transcription is still more useful than the digitally produced images that we could now present? The transcriber certainly learns a lot from making the transcription; but relatively few users of an edition know how to decode what it reveals. (Arguably, the further back into the hand-press period the texts go, the more useful the transcription may be; but the question of its relative utility in a particular case can at least be asked.)</p>
<p>Another way of making clearer the potential of the data contained in the apparatus might also be to provide, as routine, a concise discursive headnote to the textual account of each work, to map and place key issues about textual transmission.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_19"><sup>19</sup></xref> This might be supplemented by a prefatory discus sion of variation over time in the styling, spelling, punctuation, and <italic>mise-en-page</italic> of the texts, mapping them in visual and material relation to each other, and in relation to the marketing and reception of the wider canon.</p>

</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_76"/>Annotating the reading text</title>
<p>One thing that we can readily do is to highlight, explicitly and in a place where it is likely to be noticed, some of the textual data that are most suggestive for context and interpretation, referring to them in the explana tory notes as well as setting them out in full in the textual apparatus. If the evidence is complex, we could instead give a suitably explicit cross-reference to indicate that there is something particularly relevant to be found in the textual apparatus. Breaching the separation of contextual from textual data in this way could at least begin to model ways in which textual data might be seen as both accessible and relevant to reading and interpretation.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>In relation to wider scholarship and criticism</title>
<p>Given the persistence of conventions of representation that militate against the engagement of the untrained explorer with textual material, and the understandable strength of the presumption among readers that the textual apparatus is not for them, we might think also in terms of larger scholarly interventions designed to engage wider communities of readers, both inside and outside the academy. One possible approach, not altogether a novelty but not yet a commonplace, might indeed prove more substantial in its effect than the smaller-scale suggestions made above. What I have in mind is the kind of major whole-career study of a major writer that gives prominence to the textual and material dimensions of literature, transcending the boundaries between traditions of book history, textual studies, and literary criticism. There have been distinguished examples across various periods; but, in relation to the early modern concerns of the present volume, a particular interest attaches to writers whose activities predated many of the more recent institutions of authorship. The distinguished Dryden editor Paul Hammond places Dryden acutely within this context, arguing that &#x2018;When we read the poems of Dryden in a collected edition, it is easy to forget that this is not how his contemporaries would have encountered his work&#x2019;; and he goes on to demonstrate the significance of &#x2018;the contingencies of publication which our easy overview of the completed canon so often obscures&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_20"><sup>20</sup></xref> Gillian Wright has also demonstrated the trans -formatory potential of focusing consistent attention on such &#x2018;contingencies of pub lication&#x2019; in relation to a range of early modern women poets, both familiar and less familiar.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_21"><sup>21</sup></xref> The writing of late early modern people like Swift who were primarily something other than authors presents another variation: such careers might make a different kind of sense if we focused, for instance, on the agencies and contingencies involved in deciding, at specific points in time and in space, to circulate or not to circulate a work, or to print or not to print it, or to print it in a particular format or with a particular bookseller.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_22"><sup>22</sup></xref> It is indeed my hope over the next few years to write a whole-career monograph that takes Swift as the case study for such an enquiry, exploring the possibilities high -lighted by editorial work and seeing where such perspectives might lead.</p>
<p>To conclude, if there seems not to be, so far, a familiar and accepted generic blueprint for the structure and focus of a major study of an individual writer
<target target-type="page" id="page_77"/>or corpus of writings that is decisively oriented towards issues of text, book, and print and their associated agencies, that is more an opportunity than a problem. It allows scope for all kinds of structures and focuses, and all kinds of discoveries. Developing innovative large-scale studies that share the excitement of the kinds of understandings and insights traditionally hidden in the textual apparatus may yet offer a way to encourage readers to explore more boldly beyond the allure of the reading text.</p>

<p>An appendix to an edition, like its anatomical namesake, may seem an affront to its integrity, an inessential leftover, liable at best to superfluity and at worst to rupture and infection. This may not, of course, be entirely fair, and many fine editions have found a need to house material at the back end. But it remains the case that the appendix is a potentially endless excess of context, of collated fragments, or of extra-textual paraphernalia. The problem is in part one of scale, that being too substantial to be incorpor ated into notes and commentary (those more orderly places of reference) an appendix is almost by definition already swollen. Gerard Genette&#x2019;s <italic>Paratexts</italic>, so thorough a work on the cultural implications of the things at the edges of books, does not have a place for appendices. <ITALIC>OED</ITALIC>&#x2019;s desultory main definition, &#x2018;That which is attached as if by being hung on&#x2019; is then supplemented by its still more lukewarm sub-definition of the textual appendix &#x2018;An addition subjoined to a document or book, having some contributory value in connection with the subject matter of the work, but not essential to its completeness&#x2019;. This perhaps does a dis service to the fullness of its early modern usage, in which &#x2018;adjoynders&#x2019;, &#x2018;animadversions&#x2019;, and &#x2018;retractions&#x2019; might crowd in under the term, alongside postscripts, annexes, and, very often, more casually related works by the same author. Not infrequently appendices existed more or less on their own, without any apparent masterwork to which they subtend themselves, such as Edward Kinsman&#x2019;s 300-page <italic>An appendix of the saints lately canonized</italic> (1624).</p>
<p>Appendices in a major edition have many uses, among which might be to threaten a piece of writing with expulsion from the canon of the writer, by ascribing it to the category of spurious and doubtful attributions, as in Baird and Ryskamp&#x2019;s edition of <italic>Cowper&#x2019;s Poems</italic> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980&#x2013; 95). Questions of attribution, as well as questions of general worth (such as assigning something the status of juvenilia), can brutally utilise the appendix.</p>
<p>Modern editions of early modern writers often take their task to involve historicising a text. Some appendices may serve as mini-reference works to this purpose: a biographical glossary might usefully serve a work in which a slew
<target target-type="page" id="page_78"/>of names, occurring numerous times, might clog up the commentary with cross-references. In the Oxford editions of Gerrard Winstanley, for instance, a large number of obscure Diggers, whom the non-specialist reader is unlikely to know, are given short biographical treatment. Spenser&#x2019;s <italic>Letters and Other Papers</italic> includes a similar bibliographical listing of officers in colonial Ireland, English gentry, and Irish rebels. It includes also a chronology of English rule in Ireland, serving its purpose much more concisely than any introductory prose account could manage, and is supple mented by a glossary of Irish terms that are used in the communications, and the cipher used by Lord Grey.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_23"><sup>23</sup></xref> All of these are a product, no doubt, of thinking about the audience for such a volume, going beyond the needs of those readers who are already specialists, presuming a reader is in some sense new to the text or the area. What this demands has almost certainly changed over recent decades. A glossary of classical figures, while it might once have served as a convenient reference point in an appendix, may in the age of easy Google seem superfluous.</p>
<p><italic>The Arden Shakespeare</italic>, although differing in remit from other scholarly editions, has long used appendices to impressive effect, housing the sources behind the texts, whether Plutarch, Holinshed, or other precursors, music from the plays, textual minutiae, casting charts, and collation details, as well as its &#x2018;Longer Notes&#x2019; that prove too expansive for footnote, or too overarching in their remit to warrant being confined on the play-page. This is more focused in its criterion for inclusion than the provision of mere contextual material, though other Shakespeare editions do provide an array of texts in more oblique conversation with the plays themselves &#x2013; the <italic>Bedford Shakespeare Texts and Contexts</italic> taking the provision of appendices as more or less its primary and very useful purpose. But Shakespearean scholarship has its particular dynamic and more obviously serves a student audience alongside its scholarly readers.</p>
<p>Many editions deploy appendices to collect textual information, the collation of manuscript witnesses and variations, the press variants and emendations, or the &#x2018;transmissional histories&#x2019;, as the Oxford edition of Buckingham terms its listings of the changes to a text over subsequent editions. Where the additions to second or third editions are many but not enormously significant, an appendix seems a plausible place to collect them.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_24"><sup>24</sup></xref> Whether such collation belongs in the notes rather than an appendix depends on an editorial decision about its importance. Potentially, any such changes across multiple editions can have a marked intellectual import and it might be that they belong in the footnotes/endnotes, in such cases, which are far more likely to be a reference point for a reader. In the forthcoming edition of Thomas Browne&#x2019;s <italic>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</italic>, a number of scientific chapters receive substantial alterations in response to discoveries in natural philosophy and are testament to the author&#x2019;s reading and response to that reading. Not to flag this in the notes would surely be a mistake. The implication, of course, is that the appendix is not a place where we expect readers to venture very often. Many editions will not have to engage with reissues (or at least editions that the author has palpably had a hand in), and in such instances, the collation will trace press variants, which are much less likely to have major substance to them. The
<target target-type="page" id="page_79"/>Oxford edition of <italic>Donne&#x2019;s Sermons</italic>, which includes its press and other variants as footnotes on the page, also devotes a separate volume, which might be thought of as an appendix, to the bibliographical descriptions of all the witnesses (print and MS), and to tracing the textual history of the works, to avoid replicating general information, that applies across the different volumes of the <italic>Sermons</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_25"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
<p>Occasionally there are oddities to a work that can be included &#x2013; the cipher used by George Crabbe, for example, is usefully presented for those with an inclination to decipher it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_26"><sup>26</sup></xref> Barbara Lewalski&#x2019;s volume of Milton&#x2019;s poetry includes musical settings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_27"><sup>27</sup></xref> The Clarendon edition of Fielding&#x2019;s <italic>Miscellanies</italic> has a substantial edition of subscribers in an appendix and, as a source for readership and perhaps reception, this seems like a very useful research tool, in the reception history of his writings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_28"><sup>28</sup></xref> Nevertheless, it might be said that this is pushing at the boundary of the extraneous. There is a difference between something written by an author and the surrounding records. One of the Oxford Burney <italic>Journals</italic> includes an extensive statement of family finances.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_29"><sup>29</sup></xref> The relevance is more or less clear, but it does presuppose what a reader is looking for in a text. Lonsdale&#x2019;s edition of Johnson&#x2019;s <italic>Lives</italic> includes a reception history, responses and reactions in early periodicals. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_30"><sup>30</sup></xref> Again, this can be wonderfully useful, although potentially, it could produce too vast a quantity of material.</p>
<p>The <italic>Oxford Francis Bacon</italic> edition, replacing a well-worn, but widely referenced, standard work, chooses to utilise an appendix by supplying a detailed cross-reference to the Spedding 1857 edition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_31"><sup>31</sup></xref> Given that a century&#x2019;s worth of critical material makes reference to this, there is a clear and generous point in doing so, particularly given that volume editors might hope at heart to make the older edition redundant. As a general editorial practice, however, an appendix seems, intuitively, a less useful place for such a cross-reference, which might be better accomplished on the page or in the notes. Some larger collected works have whole volumes that are more or less the stuff of appendices, the scraps and notebooks, or letters that fit nowhere else. Early modern printed works often contain appendices, sometimes, as in the case of Richard Baxter, in outlandish number, the &#x2018;great quantity of loose Papers&#x2019; in <italic>Reliquiae Baxterianae</italic> (1696), itself currently being edited.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_32"><sup>32</sup></xref></p>
<p>One possibility is to use appendices for bibliographies, but it should be said against this that nothing dates an edition as quickly. A critical field from two decades ago can look antiquated and so, while editions sometimes continue to house details of critical writing, this is certainly less prevalent than it once was. One potential solution to this is to differentiate between a printed edition and any electronic edition, to consider a solution to the problem of a swollen appendix to be the Internet&#x2019;s ever-expansive resources. The <italic>Cambridge Ben Jonson Online</italic>, for example, includes a great deal of material &#x2013; music associ -ated with the plays, song and dance settings, as well as a chronology, a large bibliography, textual essays, a performance archive, a masque archive that includes financial accounts, eyewitness testimony, and ambassadors&#x2019; letters relating to Jonson&#x2019;s masques, this alongside having both old spelling and
<target target-type="page" id="page_80"/>modernised parallel editions. For all the splendid qualities of this, however, it does not intrinsically overcome the issue of parts (bibliography or essays) becoming dated, given that at some point a work needs to rest as it is. Neither is it necessarily a cheaper option &#x2013; hosting and maintaining a website even in static form remains costly. A relatively minor technical overhaul of &#x2018;appendices&#x2019; that include music and performance clips could quickly become a major investment, and the speed at which web-technology becomes obsolescent is such that overhauls are both inevitable and may well need to be regular.</p>
<p>Appendices should, no doubt, be used with caution &#x2013; many editions do without them altogether &#x2013; but the ill-fitting fact, the stray letter, or the extran -eous document that somehow makes an edition better, has a long pedigree. The forthcoming Oxford edition of Thomas Browne&#x2019;s <italic>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</italic> is certainly planning to make use of appendices, first with its task of textual collation and, alongside this, the collation of the six different editions of the text. This in itself presents a major &#x2018;technical&#x2019; puzzle about the text that we have decided is best dealt with in an appendix. Still an open question is whether to include the early responses to the text in full in the appendix or, abbreviated, within the notes: the resolution to this will in part depend on size, but my inclination is to give them full billing in their own appendices. My sense is that Browne, being so miscellaneous in character, would approve.</p>

<title>The dreaded index</title>
<p>All of us who from time to time write non-fiction books know the frustration we are faced with when we come to the Index. At first it seems so simple; and computers have made it seem more so. After all, you tag all the proper names in the book, &#x2018;find&#x2019; them in the manuscript, note the page numbers, and Bob&#x2019;s your uncle.</p>
<p>All of us who regularly use non-fiction books to look things up, bolster arguments in articles we are writing, or just find out what so-and-so says about such-and-such, know the frustration we are faced with when we come to the Index. At first it seems so simple: is such-and-such there? If not, our frustration mounts. But if such-and-such is there, frustration still lies in wait. Because if all we find is a list of twenty-three page numbers it will take us, we know, a long time to find the reference we are searching for.</p>
<p>All those who regularly publish non-fiction books know the frustration they are faced with when it comes to the Index. It is expensive enough to publish a 600-page book with a sales potential of perhaps 600 copies without having to add the preparation and printing of an Index to the cost.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_81"/>As will by now be evident, Indexes are a frustration; and that is because three different groups of people are concerned with them, and their prior ities are not necessarily the same. Authors would like the Index, ideally, to generate itself, to save them a labour that is not especially interesting. Scholars using the book would like the Index to be as detailed and elaborate as possible, to make the information they are looking for easier to find. And publishers would like the Index, since there has to be one, to be as simple and inexpensive as they can make it.</p>
<p>Part of the problem comes from the fact that scholarly books have two sorts of consumers: readers and users. The readers of a scholarly book read it the way they would a work of fiction, only more slowly and perhaps taking notes. Sometimes they scribble in the margins (preferably if the copy is their own), and on occasion they write their reactions and conclusions on the flyleaf. Such readers do not necessarily need indexes: their consumption of the book aims at its internalisation, they want (as the Book of Common Prayer put it) to &#x2018;read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest&#x2019; the book&#x2019;s matter, and perhaps to appreciate its style. Internalised, the book will become part of their mental equipment, of their intellectual and spiritual universe. An example: I remember reading, with wonder and pure pleasure, Roberto Calasso&#x2019;s <italic>The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony</italic> (1988) in just this way. And if I find myself forgetting it, I will reread it in the same manner.</p>
<p>Users of scholarly books are quite a different breed. (Of course, the same person may, and probably will, at different times be both reader and user.) Typical users are themselves in the course of conceiving, preparing or writing a text on their topic of interest, and are looking for factual information or useful arguments. They will want to find specific areas of content within the book with the fewest possible barriers of time and organisation. In such a case, they could of course use the Internet, via a search engine that has certain indexing functions built into it; but in the case of the book there is added the prestige and reliability of a known author and a known publisher; also, an increasing number of Internet sources feature paid access only, while the scholarly users may either belong to an institution that does not have the access required, or be independent scholars of limited means.</p>
<p>The result of these conflicting interests is that even now, numbers of important scholarly books appear with indexes that are, if not entirely useless, at least guaranteed to cause their scholarly users hours of frustration. Here is an example, from a very fine scholarly work (published by a distinguished house) about a sixteenth-century network of political, religious, and scholarly humanists throughout Europe:

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_82"/>The only concession made to actual users is the two figures in bold type: at the beginning of the Index there is a note saying that &#x2018;pages in bold type hold the main information concerning a person.&#x2019; The twenty-eight other page references are unexplained. One can see, though, why such an index suits the publisher: even with the minimal information offered, it still takes up twenty-seven pages of a 678-page book, i.e. about 4 per cent.</p>

<p>Such an Index is a gift to the scholarly user of the book: it gives the dates of the person mentioned, the person&#x2019;s chief position, and, for all the important mentions, a brief indication of the context before the page number(s). Interest -ingly, its number of pages in relation to that of the book as a whole (22:565) is not so different from that of the other book above: but the print in this case is several points smaller than the text.</p>
<p>What makes an excellent Index such as this problematic is the time and effort it takes to put together. In the case of the Osborn book (with which I was concerned as his research assistant during its research), the problem was solved by his employing a professional indexer at his own expense: scholarly pub lishers are rarely prepared to meet the cost of such a luxury.</p>
<p>Now, decades later, the big difference is of course the arrival of information technology, i.e. the computer. There is currently a proliferation of indexing software available to both authors and professional indexers. Some of the programmes offered claim to index a book-length text automatically; others are intended to make the work of a human indexer (who may be the author or a separate professional) easier and quicker. The American Society for Indexing (ASI) distinguishes six different types of software: (i) stand-alone or dedicated, (ii) embedded, (iii) tagging, (iv) keywording, (v) automated, and (vi)
<target target-type="page" id="page_83"/>free-text and weighted-text searching tools; see, for instance the ASA website (<uri>www.asindexing.org/reference-shelf/software/</uri>). A number of word-processing programmes already include either embedded or automated indexing possi bilities, but the ASI warns that the automated versions in particular provide only the most rudimentary information blocks.</p>
<p>Even for those authors who think they understand the coding of indexing software, trying to use it to create their own index is fraught with difficulties and traps. As Martha Osgood, a prize-winning professional indexer, explains on her admirable website Back Words Indexing: <italic>Back-of-the-Book Indexes for Publishers and Authors</italic> (<uri>www.backwordsindexing.com/Comp.html</uri>), indexing is a subtle and complex intellectual activity:</p>

<p>a computer cannot:

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>determine relationships among words and concepts, and therefore cannot place subentries, synonyms and cross-references properly</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>decide what is and is not a relevant reference - they can only sort the terms that appear in a document according to certain prepro grammed patterns</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>recognize concepts which are discussed over a range of pages</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>limit the search to relevant entries (vs. every occurrence of a word)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>function when a word is misspelled (for example: Google &#x2018;backwords&#x2019; and notice how often it is used where &#x2018;backwards&#x2019; is meant). And to the question: does an indexer really have to read the whole book? She answers, Oh yes. Several times.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>

<p>This is not to say that authors of scholarly books cannot create the indexes themselves: they have done so for a couple of centuries and, with or without computer aids, can do so still. But it is a great deal of work, and subtle work: not simply a chore. Hence the rise of professional indexers. However, these are expensive; publishers often will not pay for their use, so the author has to; and even they are not perfect.</p>
<p>The ideal procedure is probably the close cooperation of the author with a professional indexer. For this to occur, each party must be prepared to recognise the expertise of the other; and some means has to be found to pay the professional. Grants in aid of publication should ideally include a section for this; in any case, authors should bear it in mind when composing a grant application.</p>
<p>A good index is a joy for the user, and a source of justified pride for author and publisher alike.</p>

<p>This essay offers advice to editors who are faced with the often complicated problems of recording variant readings among multiple copies of Renais sance texts. While my emphasis is on transcribed copies, printed versions of a given work frequently need to be collated as well for a thorough under standing of the work&#x2019;s transmission. This advice is limited to describing some procedures for recording the variants in preparation for their analysis (textual criticism), and some options for presenting the collations to the reader in a clear and effective manner.</p>
<p>Collations have long been essential for editors of critical texts who must search out the best text from among a variety of witnesses. Only after comparing and analysing all the variant readings (the complicated process of textual criticism) can the editor of a critical edition choose the copytext and decide what readings in it, if any, need emendation and from what sources those emendations should come. However, as scribal culture attracts increasing interest in Renaissance studies, collation of outside sources becomes essential for editors of documentary editions as well. These editions present the text of a single document for its own sake without regard for superior readings from other sources. Still, the variant readings of other contemporary texts of or found in the target manuscript provide the primary evidence for determining how all the texts are related. Collation may confirm, or deny, for example, that two or more scribes obtained their copies of a text from the same source, or transmitted it to the compilers of other manuscripts or to the press. Analysis of variant readings among multiple manuscripts is our best tool for learning about the transmission of texts through the scribal networks that permeated Renaissance England. We are only beginning to understand the extent of that national network, how it operated, and who participated in it. Documentary editors need not, however, feel compelled to analyse the variants they collect and map the relationships among all the texts they collate, especially if they have doubts about their mastery of textual criticism. Simply by setting forth the collations, they enable readers to undertake this sort of analysis whether for the purpose of constructing a critical text or throwing new light on the circulation of these texts in manuscript.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_85"/>The procedures I turn to now assume that you have already located and transcribed all the available texts of the work in question, whether in manuscript or print. You will then undertake these four steps in order to collate their variants and present the results in your edition: (i) preparing the texts for comparative analysis, (ii) assigning them sigla (singular &#x2018;siglum&#x2019;), that is, symbols that represent each source in abbreviated fashion, (iii) isolating the variants, and (iv) presenting the variant readings in final form.</p>
<p>(i) Preparing the texts ordinarily involves assembling your transcriptions of them and assigning line (or in some cases, stanza) numbers so that their readings can be aligned consistently (see the line-by-line layout example in (iii)). Assigning line numbers to poems is a relatively easy matter, whereas prose texts must be divided into manageable units that correspond as exactly as possible among all the versions of the work. An aside here: it is easier than ever today to work from photocopies of the original documents, and much can be learned from comparing the texts side by side. This often complicates, however, your ability to locate corresponding lines, especially when working with a number of prose documents. You will find it much easier to work with transcriptions, which should follow the originals as closely as possible in spelling, punctuation, abbreviations, and format. If at all possible, however, you should consult the originals as you collate from your transcriptions whenever questions arise.</p>
<p>(ii) It is far too cumbersome to attribute every variant to its source by the document&#x2019;s full title, for example: the]a British Library MS Additional 28535, Bodleian Library MS Tanner 316. . . and so forth. To solve this problem, each source is traditionally identified by a unique siglum, a letter, number, or both that stands for that document. Harold Love proposed a systematic method of devising sigla. Love notes that editors often assign them rather arbitrarily as letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, D, and so forth, and that editors of printed books have long employed sigla based on format and order of publication: Q1, Q2, and so on, standing for the first, second, and later quarto printings, or F1, F2, etc. for the first and second folios.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_34"><sup>34</sup></xref> Printed sources are also sometimes referred to simply by the year of publication: 1633 and 1635, for instance, for the first two editions of <italic>John Donne&#x2019;s Poems</italic>. Love&#x2019;s system aims to devise sigla that encode &#x2018;memorability and ease of interpretation&#x2019;,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_35"><sup>35</sup></xref> by identifying the archive, collection within it, and the manuscript number within that collection. Thus British Library (BL) MS Additional 25303 becomes La03. In practice, Love&#x2019;s method often extends to five letters and numbers: Bodleian Library MS Rawlinson poetry 90, for instance, becomes Orp90 (the &#x2018;O&#x2019; standing for Oxford where the Bodleian is located).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_36"><sup>36</sup></xref> Readers don&#x2019;t have to keep looking back to the &#x2018;List of Sigla&#x2019; to recall which siglum is which, but at the cost of a rather cluttered-looking final product:
<disp-quote>

</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_86"/>Here, following the line of sigla after &#x2018;that&#x2019;, the first variant in line 43, to find the second variant, &#x2018;when&#x2019;, may seem a rather tedious challenge for some readers. Where scores of copies must be collated, fairly lengthy sigla may be unavoidable, even desirable, yet the editors of the <italic>Variorum Edition of the Poetry of John Donne</italic> have limited their sigla to just three symbols despite having to collate hundreds of documents. They have done so, however, at the expense of Love&#x2019;s &#x2018;memorability and ease of interpretation.&#x2019; In the Donne edition, each repository has its letter code followed by all the relevant manuscripts in that collection numbered sequentially. Thus British Library MS Additional 25303 appears simply as B12 in the Variorum list of sigla.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_37"><sup>37</sup></xref> It may be easy enough to remember that &#x2018;B&#x2019; stands for the British Library, but the &#x2018;12&#x2019; offers no clue as to the manuscript&#x2019;s collection (among the Additionals), or its number therein (25303).</p>
<p>In practice, I have chosen to assign sigla of one or two characters that effect a compromise between memorability and brevity. The letters and numbers refer in some way to the archive, collection, or number of the manuscript while being restricted to a maximum of two characters. Thus T alone could represent Bodleian Tanner MS 76 in a list where no other archive or collection begins with the letter &#x2018;T&#x2019;. British Library MS Add. 5495 could be designated A5, Folger MS V.a.339 as F9, and for printed works, Robert Dowland&#x2019;s <italic>A Musicall Banquet</italic> (1610), becomes RD. As with every other decision, it&#x2019;s a matter of editorial judgement as to what is the clearest and most efficient way to present the evidence to your anticipated audience.</p>
<p>Before you begin the actual task of collation, it is essential to choose the &#x2018;lemma&#x2019;, the &#x2018;base&#x2019; text with which the other versions are compared. For documentary editions, this will be the edited document itself. For editors of critical texts the choice of lemma is fairly arbitrary, but is usually made easier by choosing the longest or most complete text. It is easier to note in the collations, say, for lines &#x2018;15&#x2013;18 <italic>om</italic>. E5 GL&#x2019;, meaning that E5 and GL lack lines 15&#x2013;18, than it is to note that after line 14, a number of texts have the following four lines that are not found in the lemma. Those lines must then be inserted in the collations and their readings collated against one another (a procedure that is, nevertheless, often inescapable in a documentary edition).</p>
<p>(iii) With your lemma in place and transcriptions ready to compare with it, you are ready to begin the process of isolating all the variants among them. The end result will be the collations you deploy in your edition, which will look something like this for, in this example, lines 25&#x2013;8:
<disp-quote>
<p>25 from] so D, for AH; pleasures] pleasure D Hy;</p>
<p>26 flyte] feele D, fly AHC;</p>
<p>27 happy] happiest D L; lyfe] day D, place Hy;</p>
<p>28 wheareas] wherein AH, wherto C Hy L, wheir D</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<p>It is tempting to set forth the variants in this format from the beginning, and this is indeed feasible in cases where fewer than half a dozen texts are being compared and they display relatively few variant readings. For anything more
<target target-type="page" id="page_87"/>complicated, it is better to assemble all the texts line by line beginning with the lemma, followed by all other versions of that line:
<disp-quote>
<p>22</p>
<p>Listen to patience in her dyinge song</p>
<p>Listen to patience in her dying song Ad A6 D M Ro T</p>
<p>List but to patience in his dying songe Az P</p>
<p>Listen nowe to patience in her dying song: Hd</p>
<p>Harken to patience / in her dying songe Rn</p>
<p>Listen to patience in her dying songes R2</p>
<p>Listen to her dying song Fr</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<p>The method of setting forth all the readings here simplifies the process of picking out the variants and organising them into a coherent, abbreviated collation, yet its emphasis on substantive readings leaves it open to criticism. This protocol preserves accidentals only for the first line recorded. That works well enough for sources with unique readings such as the version in Hd (l. 4, that ends with a colon), and Rn (l. 5, with a slash punctuation mark after &#x2018;patience&#x2019;). But texts with the same substantive readings are simply listed after the first version of the line in question. Thus in line 3 above, Az spelled the line&#x2019;s final word &#x2018;songe&#x2019;, but the accidentals of P are unrecorded. Line 2 is transcribed in all respects as it appears in Ad, but the accidentals of the following five texts with those same substantive readings are not indicated.</p>
<p>(iv) For the sake of textual analysis, it is undoubtedly preferable to reproduce each source, line by line, accidentals and all, something that is feasible when a dozen or fewer texts are involved. As each line requires a block of fifteen, twenty, or more lines, however, it becomes increasingly difficult to note dis -crep ancies among them, whether of accidentals or substantives, or to match up sub stantively identical lines. I prefer to concentrate on the substantive readings, then check the originals of all texts where problems occur. I could not explain, for example, how &#x2018;anchor&#x2019; in most texts of a given poem had become &#x2018;enter&#x2019; in the rest. The answer emerged from a combination of acci -dentals and handwriting. One text spelled the word &#x2018;ancre&#x2019; with the common palaeographic ambiguity of a secretary &#x2018;c&#x2019; that looked like a &#x2018;t&#x2019;. A scribe copying that line mistook the &#x2018;a&#x2019; for &#x2018;e&#x2019; (a quite common error), read the word as &#x2018;entre&#x2019;, and spelled it &#x2018;enter&#x2019;. I might have noticed this possibility in copying all the lines exactly (and remembering that secretary &#x2018;c&#x2019; and &#x2018;t&#x2019; are ambiguous in many hands). Generally, however, I have found it more efficient to turn to the original accidentals and handwriting after I have located the cruxes (cruces), that is, readings that are puzzling and hard to choose among or explain. To do that, I work primarily in the &#x2018;macro&#x2019; context with substantive readings in order to establish manifest textual relationships. By the same logic, where accidentals among the texts (such as different spellings, punctuation, capitalisation, italic, or engrossed [bold] script, underlinings and the like) lack any obvious function that changes the meaning (substance) of the text or reveals connections between texts, it seems to me merely pedantic to record them in the final collation.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_88"/>That final output, based on the variants listed in line 22, above should look something like this:
<disp-quote>
<p>22 Listen] List but As P, Listen nowe Hd, Harken Rn; patience in] om. Fr; her] his As P; song] songes R2.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<p>Many conventions are in play here, and a number of choices have been made to put the variants in this form. After the line number, the first reading of the lemma for which there is a variant, &#x2018;Listen&#x2019;, is entered to the left of the bracket with the variant on the right followed by the sigla which have that reading (As P). Two more variants from &#x2018;Listen&#x2019; follow, those in Hd and Rn. Variants in the same passage within the line are conventionally separated by a comma. The placement of the semi-colon marks the end of the variants for that reading, followed by the next lemma reading, &#x2018;patience in&#x2019;, a phrase that is omitted in Fr. Following the semi-colon, the lemma reading &#x2018;her&#x2019; is shown to be replaced in As P with &#x2018;his&#x2019;, then the lemma reading &#x2018;song&#x2019; is replaced with &#x2018;songes&#x2019; in R2. The square bracket has become the standard mark of punctuation for separating the lemma from its variants. Ideally, any interpolation in the collations that is not a variant is italicised so as to be more easily differentiated from readings themselves. This is illustrated by the sigla in the example above, and the abbreviation <italic>om</italic>. for &#x2018;omitted&#x2019;.</p>
<p>The following three problems crop up frequently in collating Renaissance manuscript texts. First, the same word may appear two or more times in a single line, but with a variant reading in only one instance. In Donne&#x2019;s &#x2018;The Storm&#x2019;, line 37 reads &#x2018;But when I wakt, I saw, that I saw not&#x2019;;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_38"><sup>38</sup></xref> a collation that reads &#x2018;I saw] I knew <italic>1633, 1635</italic>&#x2019; is useless because it could apply to either &#x2018;I saw&#x2019;. The solution is to quote a word (or two, if need be) to resolve the ambiguity: &#x2018;I saw not] I knew not <italic>1633, 1635</italic>&#x2019;. On occasion, every text will agree against the lemma, which does not pose a significant problem where only three or four documents are in play. To avoid a longer string of sigla, however, it is conventional to employ a symbol that stands for all the texts except the lemma. An asterisk (*) commonly serves this function; Love prefers the Greek sigma ( ; 225). Just be sure to explain your practice in a prefatory note to your &#x03C3; reader. Third, some variant lines differ so drastically from the lemma that a piecemeal collation is awkward or impos sible. In such cases, after the line number or wherever in the sequence variants from that source are to appear, preface the entire line with &#x2018;sub.&#x2019; for &#x2018;substitute&#x2019;.</p>

<p>Locating and collating the variant readings of multiple texts is a tedious undertaking. It is essential, however, to a number of important scholarly endeavours. It is the only way to determine the most authoritative version among rival copies of a given text prepared as a critical edition. The analysis of variants is a highly dependable way of discovering often unsuspected relationships among the texts, including entire documents. The resulting lines of transmission allow us to reconstruct portions of the larger scribal networks, often showing where and when the documents in question were copied. Moreover, by clarifying where and when ascriptions were added to texts, the analysis of variants can also influence cases of disputed authorship, sometimes
<target target-type="page" id="page_89"/>decisively. Collations, often considered merely so much pedantic apparatus, are instead key evidence conducive to important results that often cannot be obtained by any other means.</p>

<p>In bibliographical terminology today, &#x2018;collation&#x2019; unhelpfully means two rather distinct things. To collate a book can mean to establish its physical make-up by investigation of the way in which its constituent leaves have been folded, nested, and combined into quires, but this usage is relatively modern (<ITALIC>OED</ITALIC>&#x2019;s first recorded usage dates to 1834). Another sense relates to the comparison of a stretch of text across two or more different books, or across multiple copies of the same edition or issue of that book, in order to determine whether any changes were introduced (intentionally or unintentionally) during that book&#x2019;s process of production. The technologies for establishing variance in manu scripts and printed books are rather dif ferent, and the reason is that, in order to effectively collate from manuscript with the help of computers, reliable tran -scriptions will need to serve as proxy for the manuscript text. Collation of early printed books is different, in that the printed artefacts can be optically collated: as long as type has not been significantly reset, two books can be placed side by side (actually, or virtually) and compared as if they were an image.</p>
<p>Among editorial circles, the process of collation is discussed in hushed whispers. It is an arcane art that to the uninitiated promises ultimate biblio -graphic, even scientific, rigour and accountability: collating can aid in the process of textual criticism and bibliography, and so may ultimately lead to more refined textual analysis (often of a literary kind). However, once a scholar embarks on a protracted collation campaign &#x2013; lugging around a set of collating mirrors from one library to the next, sitting for hours on end, sometimes days, in order to detect press variants but regularly finding nothing at all &#x2013; it quickly emerges that the process is far from an exact science. It is the purpose of this chapter somewhat to demystify the use of optical collation, to give some practical recommendations, while also keeping an open mind as to exactly how the process ties in with the particular preoccupations of textual criticism.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_39"><sup>39</sup></xref></p>
<p>The production of printed books was an organic process, and more often than not, when type was set, multiple pages placed into a forme (the entire assemblage, including the chase or frame, into which type was secured before printing), and the first few sheets pulled, a proofreader would intervene and make corrections, causing the forme to be unlocked and therefore upsetting the type.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_40"><sup>40</sup></xref> Sheets already printed would still be sold, as would those printed after the corrections were made (obviously, multiple rounds of correction could be
<target target-type="page" id="page_90"/>made to a single forme or page). As a result, seemingly identical issues and editions of any early book are, almost as a rule, slightly to considerably variant. Sometimes those variants are relatively unimportant to the textual editor, but at other times, press corrections can have colossal implications for meaning and, as a result, the establishment of a reliable text &#x2013; especially when such corrections were the result of the intentional intervention of an author, proofreader, or other producer with an eye on intelligible output. It has, over the course of the twentieth century and the development of critical standards, become the job of the editor to document printed variants in minute detail: first, to establish a good text for presentation to the modern reader, and second, to come to understand the process of production. Whereas the first (&#x2018;good text&#x2019;) may seem only to be of interest to the interpretative textual critic, and the second (understanding of the printing process) only of interest to the bibliographer, in fact today&#x2019;s discipline of &#x2018;the history of the book&#x2019; has fused these areas of enquiry: the modern critical edition presents a holistic view of the textual witness, and accumulative evidence of minute bibliographical queries can (sometimes, not always) come to inform questions of inter -pretation.</p>
<p>It was not until the advent of the &#x2018;new bibliography&#x2019; of the earlier twentieth century that technologies were pioneered to aid the editor in optical collation, which up to then was undertaken with the human eye alone. The first such invention in the 1940s was the &#x2018;Hinman collator&#x2019;, invented by Charlton Hinman, a machine which, by means of mirrors and flashing lights, allowed for the projection and superimposition of the images of the same page from two different books. The Hinman collator was large and extremely unwieldy, and smaller devices have since been invented: the &#x2018;Lindstrand comparator&#x2019;, the &#x2018;McCleod collator&#x2019; (invented by Randall McLeod), and what is today the smallest and therefore most user-friendly collator, &#x2018;Hailey&#x2019;s Comet&#x2019; (devised by Carter Hailey). The latter two devices work on the same principle: careful placement of two books (a base copy and a target copy), and the careful placement of two mirrors, allow for the virtual superimposition of two pages. The process is in principle identical to using 1:1 photocopies onto acetate transparencies, where these can be placed over another copy of the same book, so that any changes in the type resulting in a textual variant can be visually observed. With the help of mirrors, superimposition is achieved in the brain: the collating machines are set up in such a way that one eye views the control copy of a book (this can be a hard copy or digital image), and the other eye the target copy. When those two images are sufficiently similar in terms of size and spatial orientation, the brain is fooled into believing it sees one book. In the case of textual variance (e.g. a new word inset, a piece of punctuation removed, a line break altered), the eyes will register conflicting information, which results in what can best be described as a visual disturbance: a three-dimensional shimmering effect on the page, where either one or the other reading jumps in and out of existence. The collating editor will learn to look out for such visual clues, and once proficient in this process, can move through a printed book at relative speed (many factors influence the speed of collating, but this writer, once fully trained, managed to collate a small quarto book of
<target target-type="page" id="page_91"/>around 100 pages in about two hours; conversely, an 800-page folio took up the better part of a week).</p>
<p>It is also possible to optically collate without any tools, by eye alone, in at least two ways. First, one can simply compare two books side by side, but this quickly leads to distraction. Since the cognitive human brain makes habitual and considerable allowances for textual variance, unless the col lating editor is extremely (inhumanly) observant, small variants (in spelling, punctuation, capitalisation, spacing) are likely not all to register. A number of collating practitioners also report the method of &#x2018;sight collation&#x2019;: after placing two copies alongside each other, Joseph Dane prescribes to &#x2018;stare at the two pages, and cross your eyes. The images will double; on a good day, after a deep breath, two of the now four images will superimpose magically as a third image. And on this superimposed image (or perceptual illusion), variants in the two copies stand out in three-dimensionality&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_41"><sup>41</sup></xref> Needless to say, this type of work is time limited. Dane reports that the maximum time he efficiently spent on a mirrored collator is two hours. This writer has managed longer than that, but rarely more than a full morning or afternoon. It is helpful to collate the text from bottom to top, or even upside-down, so as not to become distracted by the meaning or flow of the words on the page.</p>
<p>The above description of collation with mirrors or by eye may still seem very hard to grasp, and since imposition occurs in the brain only, no handy photographs can be given of what it actually looks like. It is therefore not easy to prescribe a collation workflow. If one was presented simply with two books and two mirrors without instructions, setting up a collator is a difficult and extremely frustrating exercise, since the number of variables (position and angle of the two books, position and angle of the mirrors) is all but infinite, and the margin of error is very small. However, with dedication, determination, and patience, the process can be mastered by just about any editor who has good stereoscopic vision. Seeking advice from colleagues who have previously mastered the art is a crucial first step. Some major research libraries (e.g. the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library) also have in-house collators that can be borrowed for use in that library, and the McCleod collator comes with valuable instructions.</p>
<p>How many copies to collate in order to arrive at a full record of press correction is dependent upon the number of extant books, the book&#x2019;s format and length, accessibility of copies, the quality of the printing (though this may not be known before collation), and, rather crucially, budgetary and time constraints. Williams and Abbott have recommended &#x2018;between twelve and twenty&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_42"><sup>42</sup></xref> Mark Bland has more recently suggested that &#x2018;in practical terms, it may be necessary to collate up to 80 copies of a printed edition in order to ensure that every stop-press correction is recorded&#x2019;. Bland himself collated Ben Jonson&#x2019;s 1616 and 1640 <italic>Workes</italic>, and stated that whereas &#x2018;40&#x2013;50 copies would have been satisfactory, for others the last variants were not found until 65&#x2013;80 copies had been collated&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_43"><sup>43</sup></xref> When Charlton Hinman collated his 50+ copies of <italic>Shakespeare&#x2019;s First Folio</italic>, he could do so primarily because the majority of these books were held at a single repository, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and even there he was at work full-time for over two years. Such numbers may seem
<target target-type="page" id="page_92"/>daunting, especially to travelling collating editors who will find themselves hunting rare copies through ever further geographically dispersed libraries, and no editorial project is without a limit on resources. Editors, then, need carefully to weigh the potential benefits of a fully fledged collational campaign, and may settle for a smaller sample. For instance, in the seventeenth century John Donne&#x2019;s sermons were printed in over 20 individual quartos and smaller format books (incl. reissues and new editions), and in three folios totalling over 1,500 pages: presented with such a mass of textual evidence, the editors of <italic>The Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne</italic> collated a minimum of ten copies each (and more when possible, or when textual cruxes remained unresolved).</p>
<p>It is advisable that the control copy is always the same book. In most instances, however, the collating editor will not be in a position to carry around an early printed book, so he or she may have to work from digital images on screen, or photographic hard copy, and this is not necessarily a disadvantage, since especially images on a screen are far easier manipulated than a book. It is also advisable to create these images from scratch and in full colour: the now ubiquitous digital facsimiles available through <italic>Early English Books Online</italic>, which largely consist of low-resolution monochrome scans from microfilm, are insufficiently precise for the purpose of collating. Collecting typographical variants across a corpus of printed books is a process of slow accrual: even the seasoned collating editor will miss small variants, and will have to return to earlier books once new variants are detected in others, to make sure that these variants were not previously missed. It should not be expected that variants appear in predictable patterns, since printed sheets were not always regularly bundled and sold in the order of production. Variants can most meaningfully be analysed by attending not to the unit of the page, but to the forme, in which changes were most commonly made while production was in progress. The type of variants encountered can be intentional on the part of the compositors (where a mistake has been corrected), or unintentional, where a page has been reimposed in its forme (often in reissues or later editions), resulting in some moving around (and therefore some slight visual disturbance) of, for instance, page numbers, marginal references, or other parts of the text. A great deal of evidence collected therefore has no direct bearing upon editing text, and the editing collator will have to decide before embarking on the campaign what sort of data should be collected.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, two digital collating tools are in the process of being developed. The first is Paragon (<uri>https://sc.edu/about/centers/digital_humanities/ projects/paragon.php</uri>), an online collation tool created at the University of South Carolina in collaboration with the <italic>Collected Works of Edmund Spenser</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_44"><sup>44</sup></xref> Paragon allows for the uploading of scans of early modern books, and an advanced algorithm compares a &#x2018;template&#x2019; (base text) against a single or multiple &#x2018;targets&#x2019; (copies of the same from other books); moreover, the software is also designed to circumvent a series of material obstacles, such as page warp, in order to more effectively conduct a pixel-by-pixel comparison. The second innovation is being developed at the University of Oxford under the auspices of the <italic>Oxford Edition of the Works of Thomas Traherne</italic>,
<target target-type="page" id="page_93"/>in collaboration with the Visual Geometry Group in Engineering Science at Oxford, and Oxford Physics (<uri>http://oxfordtraherne.org/digital-collator-project/</uri>).</p>
<p>This team is developing a stand-alone software application, which offers a great deal of flexibility in terms of visually rendering variants on the page. Using a digital camera set-up, the application aims at real-time collation on site in libraries.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_45"><sup>45</sup></xref> Both software packages still rely on human intervention (and therefore, a bibliographically informed scholar), since areas of variance of all kinds between the template and target are visually highlighted, but it is up to the collator to interpret the results. Software solutions could significantly minimise the need for the editor to travel, since the process can entirely be undertaken with high-quality photographs. If professional photography in libraries and archives is still costly, the fact that many major anglophone research libraries now allow for personal photography means that software solutions are likely to revolutionise the practice of collation in the future, and so the fully analogue-collating mirrors may gradually be phased out. Twenty-five years ago, Williams and Abbott expressed the hope that &#x2018;the computer would bring an end to the drudgery of collating texts&#x2019;, and today, that moment is perhaps nearly upon us.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_46"><sup>46</sup></xref></p>

<p>The arguments for and against modernisation of spelling or punctuation (or both) are familiar and extensively discussed in this section of the <italic>Handbook</italic>. There are, however, other aspects of the discussion that have received less attention and which may be worth further consideration.</p>
<p>The question of whether to modernise or not is often thought of as the hard part of the many decisions that surround editing an early modern work. It does present a difficult choice between competing theories and ideologies concerning the nature of texts. Yet that is only the beginning of a process that tests an editor&#x2019;s understanding of the text being edited. Of course, old- or original-spelling texts can simply act as reprints of original editions (based, one hopes, on the collation of a suitable number of exemplars for stop-press variants and a due consideration of their order of production and of their significance). Yet, as Gavin Alexander points out (2.3.2), this is something of an abrogation of editorial duty. An editor who seeks to examine the text of an original-spelling edition critically will be faced with a range of problems and decisions. The most obvious one will be what to do when the text does not make sense and emendation is necessary. Some schools of editorial &#x2013; or rather unediting &#x2013; theory would hold that emending the text is simply wrong; but supposing the editor does not want to print nonsense, should the emendation take a modernised or normalised form or should it seek to reproduce the same orthographic practices as the original text? What is the editor to do when an anomalous form occurs in a text? In a well-known crux at the end of <italic>Antony and Cleopatra</italic>, the Queen in her monument sees her lover for the last time and exclaims in the Folio:
<disp-quote>
<p>Cleo. Oh Sunne,</p>
<p>Burne the great Sphere thou mou&#x2019;st in, darkling stand</p>
<p>The varrying shore o&#x2019;th&#x2019;world. O Antony, Antony, Antony . . .<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_47"><sup>47</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<p>This is the one moment in the play when the form &#x2018;Antony&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;Anthony&#x2019; is used. The setting of the line is very tight in the folio and one explanation for the distinctive spelling here is that three hs would have caused
<target target-type="page" id="page_95"/>the compositor to have to run the line on or to turn it up or down. If the mechanical explanation for &#x2018;Antony&#x2019; is correct here, should the editor normalise the word?</p>
<p>Editing an old-spelling text can pose many difficult problems of this kind. Producing a modern-spelling text forces the editor, in a sense, to translate it into a new form and in doing so to show a clear understanding of it. As Roger Kuin argues (2.3.3), much may be lost in modernisation as part of a process in which the unfamiliar and difficult is rendered (relatively) familiar and easy. At the same time, a really excellent modernisation of a difficult text may, like a rendering of it from one language to another, add something to it &#x2013; this is particularly true for the treatment of punctuation, as much in prose works as in poetry or drama. In relation to Shakespeare, the main issues involved in modernisation have been examined by Stanley Wells.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_48"><sup>48</sup></xref> It is not difficult to be guided by headword forms in the <ITALIC>OED</ITALIC>, but the &#x2018;right&#x2019; choice of proper nouns remains a contentious issue. What is the correct form of the title of Philip Sidney&#x2019;s sonnet sequence and the name of its male protagonist? The title of Shakespeare&#x2019;s Roman tragedy discussed above raises other questions. The <italic>Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names</italic> reports that &#x2018;The intrusive h in the spelling Anthony was a late development, and seems not to appear before the late 16th C.&#x2019; Furthermore, &#x2018;The h is, of course, silent&#x2019;, but liable to be pronounced in the United States.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_49"><sup>49</sup></xref></p>
<p>This raises further, very obvious, issues about modernisation: English is not a single language and it changes over time and in different countries. Shakespeare in American English spelling may look odd to, say, British readers, but no clear argument is apparent that it is &#x2018;wrong&#x2019; in some sense. Indeed, one of the most distinctive modern US forms, words ending with &#x2013;or rather than &#x2013;our, can be found regularly in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British books. American punctuation practices tend to be slightly different from British ones, but nobody is going to be misled by double inverted commas around reported speech rather than single ones or to be confused by the American preference for more rather than fewer commas. The real difficulty comes with choosing orthographic forms that are not current. The most notorious example of this is the decision in the <italic>Riverside Shakespeare</italic> &#x2018;to preserve a selection of Elizabethan spelling forms that reflect, or may reflect, a distinctive contem -porary pronunciation&#x2019;; hence forms such as &#x2018;wrack&#x2019; for &#x2018;wreck&#x2019; and &#x2018;bankrout&#x2019; for &#x2018;bankrupt&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_50"><sup>50</sup></xref> &#x2018;Come to my woman&#x2019;s breasts&#x2019;, Lady Macbeth says in the <italic>Riverside</italic> edition, &#x2018;And take my milk for gall, you murth&#x2019;ring ministers&#x2019; (1.5.47&#x2013;8). For its second edition, <italic>Riverside</italic> added Edward III to the volume; in it, Prince Edward is made to refer to &#x2018;The imperial victory of murd&#x2019;ring death&#x2019; (4.4.154). Times change and so do orthographic practices; <italic>Riverside</italic>&#x2019;s main text represents the traditional Shakespeare canon in a state of spelling that has never existed.</p>
<p>There are other problematic issues that editing and modernising raise, such as the treatment of foreign languages, dialect, incorrect forms (such as malapropisms), onomatopoeic words, interjections, and colloquial lan guage. In verse, the demands (real or imagined) of metre and rhyme may force or enticingly tempt the adoption of forms that are not convincingly modern.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_96"/>Once an editor has chosen to modernise a text, decided which sort of English to use in the new version, and opted to use present-day forms and punctuation, it might be thought that work can commence and that, although there may be local problems, the rest of the task appears to be relatively straightforward. It is at this point &#x2013; if it has not already occurred &#x2013; that editorial idealism meets publishing realities. For whether to modernise or not and then how to modernise are significant parts of a delicate nego tiation between the texts editors wish to produce, the need for publishers to sell books, the demands of readers, and, in many cases, the constraints of a series.</p>
<p>Most scholarly publishers do not issue guidelines to editors explaining how to go about their tasks. They will, however, have definite house styles which editors will be expected to follow and whose consistency copy-editors will police. Oxford University Press is the British exception here and not just because of its constant demand for, insistence on, and scrupulous observation of the Oxford comma. No editor, perhaps no writer, should begin work without a copy of the <italic>New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors</italic>, first published in 2005, within easy reach. Editorial work and especially modernisation would be much easier if the <italic>Dictionary</italic> had the force of national or even international law. When it comes to questions of preferred forms, spellings, hyphenation, italicisation, diacritics, capitalisa tion, punctuation, abbreviations, etc., it serves the na&#x00EF;ve tyro as well as the elite; the merest <italic>coup d&#x2019;&#x0153;il</italic> determines the correct form of <italic>hapax legomena</italic> for copy-editor, proofreader, and printing press alike.</p>
<p>Publishers of scholarly series will usually expect the series&#x2019; general editors to prepare a handbook or a set of guidelines for editors to ensure or at least to promote consistency between different volumes and different editors. Such guide ines may be relatively brief or they may be more expansive: the editorial guidelines for the third series of the Arden Shakespeare run to over 18,000 words. General editors may wish to make the guidelines as full and compre -hensible as possible, to legislate for all possible occasions, but it is impossible to anticipate all the problems that modernisation entails. Further more, there is, inevitably, an inverse relationship between the length and the complexity of the guidelines and the individual editor&#x2019;s ability to remember all the instructions and preferences.</p>
<p>One area of modernisation that has received surprisingly little attention in guidelines and handbooks is the punctuation of speech. The history of the conventions for this in English literature appears not to have been examined as a whole.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_51"><sup>51</sup></xref> An editor faced with inserting punctuation into unpunctuated dialogue from original texts stumbles across a problem that may result in a certain amount of frustration. The modern conventions for punctuating speech appear to derive from contemporary novels and sit oddly with early modern works, especially dramatic and semi-dramatic ones. One example may give a small indication of this. In <italic>The Rape of Lucrece</italic>, Tarquin interrupts one of Lucrece&#x2019;s speeches. The lines appear in the 1594 quarto as:
<disp-quote>

<verse-group>
<verse-line>So let thy thoughts low vassals to thy state,</verse-line>
<verse-line>No more quoth he, by Heauen I will not heare thee.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_52"><sup>52</sup></xref></verse-line>
</verse-group>

<p><italic>To modernise or not to modernise?</italic> 97 In modernising them, punctuation has to be added:


<verse-group>
<verse-line>&#x2018;So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state &#x2013;&#x2019;</verse-line>
<verse-line>&#x2018;No more,&#x2019; quoth he. &#x2018;By heaven, I will not hear thee![&#x2019;]<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_53"><sup>53</sup></xref></verse-line>
</verse-group>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<p>The pointing follows modern practice. Two features are worth noting: the dash signalling that Lucrece&#x2019;s speech is interrupted and broken off comes before the closing inverted comma (in the <italic>Riverside</italic> edition it comes outside the closing double inverted commas), and the comma after &#x2018;No more&#x2019; is also kept within the inverted commas. Yet the functions of both marks of punctuation are quite different: the dash can be taken to be an integral part of her speech, but grammatically the comma is not part of his: it exists to demarcate what he says from the speech direction. Common sense suggests that it should read:

<verse-group>
<verse-line>&#x2018;No more&#x2019;, quoth he . . .</verse-line>
</verse-group>
</p>

<p>But this is not how suspended quotations are generally punctuated in fiction; in such cases, publishers&#x2019; conventions conflict with editorial wishes.</p>
<p>Far from being a simple mechanical process, modernisation requires a deep understanding of the text in question, a grasp of and sensitivity to modern English language (of one kind or another) and to punctuation, as well as an ability to reconcile the different demands made by publishers and general editors. Above all, the editor needs to be conscious of what readers of the edition will find most clear and comprehensible.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Because early modern works survive in early modern texts (unlike, say, works from ancient Rome, where the surviving textual witnesses are much later), readers have the chance to engage with the language of early modern writers within the texture of spelling and punctuation that they knew. This can make reading more difficult, and that difficulty can be rewarding.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_54"><sup>54</sup></xref> But only where an edition provides an exact transcript of an autograph manuscript can we be certain that the hermeneutic fun we are having has been generated only by the author and not also by scribes and/or com positors, not to mention editors. Different works demand different editorial approaches, and sometimes the best approach will be to modernise spelling and punctuation. If the scribe or
<target target-type="page" id="page_98"/>compositor has made a mess of the sense, what value is there for the reader in labouring over an author&#x2019;s words obscurely glimpsed through a veil of misinformation? It might be objected that the reader of the modern-spelling edition will lose touch with the materiality of the original text, but does any edition really deliver that? As Joseph Black argues below (2.3.4), a reader genuinely interested in early modern literature should always supplement the use of editions with the consultation of original print and manuscript texts. Philip Gaskell sets out some sensible objections to modernising:
<disp-quote>
<p>The deliberate modernisation of the spelling, punctuation, etc. of an early text is undesirable because it suggests that the modern meaning of the words of the text is what the author meant by them; because it conceals puns and rhymes; because it causes the editor to choose where the author was ambiguous; and because it deprives the work of the quality of belonging to its own period.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_55"><sup>55</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These objections are all valid. I wish, however, to weigh against them various worries I have about old-spelling editions, worries that have led me on occasion to prefer to modernise. My worries are primarily about what readers will be led to assume they are getting in an edition, and about mediations that might look like they are offering unmediated access to the original form of a text (for example, the &#x2018;old-spelling&#x2019; edition that modern ises i/j and u/v, regularises punctuation, introduces possessive apostrophes and quotation marks, expands abbreviations, and so on). I am also worried about how old-spelling editions can deter editors from actually editing, in the sense of engaging in thoughtful acts of textual criticism. My worries can be reduced to five heads, on which I will elaborate in what follows, giving examples from texts and editions of writers in the Sidney circle. Old-spelling editions, I suggest, (i) fetishise the copy-text; (ii) present texts derived from different copy-texts in a way that obscures their differences; (iii) often use texts whose accidentals of spelling and punctuation have no relation to the author; (iv) when edited eclectically give an appearance of authenticity to something created in the present day; and (v) may be led astray by concerns for the modern reader that might be better addressed by giving that reader a modern-spelling edition.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Example 1</title>
<p>Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke&#x2019;s <italic>The Triumph of Death</italic> is a trans lation from Petrarch that survives in only one manuscript copy, at several removes from a putative authorial original.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_56"><sup>56</sup></xref> Pembroke&#x2019;s other works survive in far more authoritative forms, but <italic>The Triumph</italic> is something of an outlier. In the admirable Oxford edition of Pembroke&#x2019;s works, the editorial policy of old spelling and minimal emendation &#x2013; which serves those other works very well &#x2013; produces in this case something less satisfactory, because the copy-text has been granted an authority it does not deserve. Here is one example among many where Pembroke&#x2019;s <italic>terza rima</italic> rhyme scheme (as well as Petrarch&#x2019;s Italian, which Pembroke translates attentively) shows us that an emendation is needed:

<verse-group>
<verse-line><target target-type="page" id="page_99"/>O wretch, who doest in mortall things affye:</verse-line>
<verse-line>(yett who but doeth) and if in end they dye</verse-line>
<verse-line>Them-selve&#x2019;s beguil&#x2019;d, they finde but right, saie I.</verse-line>
<verse-line>What meane&#x2019;s this toyle? Oh blinde, oh more then blinde:</verse-line>
<verse-line>(&#x2018;first chapter&#x2019;, ll. 85&#x2013;8)</verse-line>
</verse-group>
</p>

<p>The word at the end of the second line should very clearly be &#x2018;find(e)&#x2019;, not &#x2018;dye&#x2019; (the result of scribal eyeskip). (As H.R. Woudhuysen points out above in 2.3.1, deciding how to spell the emendation is a particular challenge for the old-spelling editor.) This example also shows how the scribe&#x2019;s relatively thought-free punctuation hinders the reader&#x2019;s understanding of the poem&#x2019;s extended periods. We are often conservative about emending texts, partly because true textual criticism demands a particular skill-set and a high degree of responsi -bility,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_57"><sup>57</sup></xref> but especially because we are trying to represent a text authentically. Here, however, it is a corrupt witness, and not Pembroke&#x2019;s poem, that is the object of authentic representation: a properly critical edition in modern spelling might better deliver her words and her sense.</p>
</sec3>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Example 2</title>
<p>The copy-text of the Sidney <italic>Psalms</italic> in that same Oxford edition is a manuscript (the &#x2018;Penshurst manuscript&#x2019;) beautifully and carefully copied by a highly skilled poet-scribe, John Davies of Hereford, working under Pembroke&#x2019;s close supervision, but the edited text has an appearance typo graphically identical to <italic>The Triumph</italic>: the two copy-texts now have, as it were, an equalised authority. We see a different version of this problem in William A. Ringler&#x2019;s superb 1962 edition of Philip Sidney&#x2019;s poems, where Sidney&#x2019;s portion of the <italic>Psalms</italic> is edited not from the Penshurst manuscript but from a late seventeenth-century copy, carefully made by the clergyman and poet Samuel Woodford, of the working papers in which Sidney&#x2019;s text could be seen beneath Pembroke&#x2019;s revision of it. Ringler might have spliced these readings (sometimes whole stanzas) into an earlier copy-text, but he preferred to stick with Woodford, which means that in his old-spelling edition he must perforce present Sidney with the accidentals of a copy from 1695 of an Elizabethan document, a strange hybridised orthography that might sometimes be Sidney&#x2019;s but will often be Woodford&#x2019;s. This pushes beyond the limits of Ringler&#x2019;s editorial policy: &#x2018;Since no holographs of any of Sidney&#x2019;s poems survive and since none of the extant manuscripts or prints preserves his spelling and punctuation, for each poem the most readable sixteenth century version has been chosen as copy-text&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_58"><sup>58</sup></xref> <italic>Readability</italic> is an awkward criterion, and Ringler was in some discomfort, as he explained in a later essay:
<disp-quote>
<p>I originally wanted to produce a normalised (not modernised) text, but . . . the policy of the Clarendon Press was to produce old-spelling texts . . . besides, it is easier for an editor to produce an old-spelling edition because he has fewer decisions to make. But I did append an analysis . . . of the patterns of spelling and punctuation found in Sidney&#x2019;s prose
<target target-type="page" id="page_100"/>holographs . . . and demonstrated that scarcely any of the characteristics of his accidentals were preserved by his scribes and compositors. Because the texts available were all scribal or compositorial, this analysis showed the utter irrelevance of an old-spelling edition of Sidney.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_59"><sup>59</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When I study <italic>Astrophil and Stella</italic> or the <italic>Arcadia</italic> poems in Ringler&#x2019;s edition, the old spelling does make me feel that I am closer to Sidney than when I use a modern-spelling edition. But the strange orthography of the <italic>Psalms</italic> has almost the opposite effect.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Example 3</title>
<p>Editions that mix readings from various sources into an old-spelling text risk making a modern monster look like an authentic document from the past. The Greg-Bowers theory of copy-text was developed to guide editors of (typically dramatic) works that did not survive in authorial or even authorised manuscript copies, but where there might be hope that early printed copies would preserve traces of authorial spelling and punctuation. The practice (earliest text as copy-text delivers accidentals of spelling and punctuation; latest text that might represent authorial intentions supplies substantive emenda tions) generates edited texts that are hybrids, and in some cases these hybrids supplant perfectly good authorised or autograph manuscript or printed texts that might be transcribed unemended.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_60"><sup>60</sup></xref> Most of the poems in Mary Wroth&#x2019;s <italic>Pamphilia to Amphilanthus</italic> exist in two forms: her autograph manuscript in the Folger Shakespeare Library, and the printed text found at the end of Wroth&#x2019;s <italic>Urania</italic> (1621), which seems to represent a later stage of authorial revision. Josephine Roberts describes her policy, built on the Greg-Bowers tradition:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is clear that <italic>both</italic> versions of <italic>Pamphilia to Amphilanthu</italic>s . . . provide a modern editor with extremely valuable information. . . In this edition, the holograph manuscript . . . has been selected as the copy-text . . . I have followed the orthography of the manuscript despite the occasional variations in the spelling of a single word. The manuscript contains some misleading spellings, such as the number two (&#x2018;tow&#x2019;), the adverb too (&#x2018;to&#x2019;), and the adverb off (&#x2018;of&#x2019;). In these three cases where Lady Mary Wroth&#x2019;s orthography may create serious confusion for a modern reader, I have included the corrected spelling from the 1621 text, but have indicated the change in a textual note.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_61"><sup>61</sup></xref></p>

<p>Here is Roberts&#x2019;s text of one sonnet (P82):


<verse-group>
<verse-line>Hee may owr profitt, and our Tuter prove</verse-line>
<verse-line>In whom alone wee doe this power finde,</verse-line>
<verse-line>To joine two harts as in one frame to move;</verse-line>

<verse-group>
<verse-line>Itt doth inrich the witts, and <italic>make</italic> you see</verse-line>

<verse-group>
<verse-line>Millions of thes adorne the throne of Love,</verse-line>
<verse-line>How blest <italic>bee</italic> they then, who his favours prove.</verse-line>
</verse-group>
</p>

<p>The italicised cruces are all cases where the 1621 and Folger texts differ. Wroth wrote &#x2018;Eyes wt much care&#x2019; in line 5 and if we assume that the (presumably autograph) copy from which the 1621 text was set was identical here, it is easy to account for &#x2018;which must&#x2019; as a misreading. Roberts also adopts 1621&#x2019;s &#x2018;make&#x2019; in line 9, where Wroth&#x2019;s &#x2018;makes&#x2019; seems better. But she declines 1621&#x2019;s &#x2018;are&#x2019; in the final line. So we have an eclectic text: its substantives are a combination of two texts; its accidentals are also a hybrid. And yet the edited text looks authentic because it is in old spelling. Line 1, incidentally, shows us that a modernisation may not be straightforwardly preferable (and here it may be that a difference between verse and prose emerges, as Roger Kuin&#x2019;s remarks below in 2.3.3 about Spenser may also encourage us to think). The ambiguous &#x2018;profitt&#x2019; (an ambiguity almost but not entirely lost in 1621&#x2019;s &#x2018;Prophet&#x2019;) will need to be either &#x2018;profit&#x2019; or &#x2018;prophet&#x2019; in a modernised edition.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In lines 3&#x2013;4 of that sonnet, Roberts emends &#x2018;tow&#x2019; to &#x2018;two&#x2019; to aid the reader, a problematic exception to a rule. Ringler chooses as copy-text &#x2018;the most readable version&#x2019;. A concern to give the reader what she needs in an old-spelling edition can compromise the development and application of editorial principles, when those readerly needs might be better served by a modern-spelling edition. Modernisation may be able to introduce punctua tion that better represents for the modern reader the syntactic disposition of the original words. Modernisation also, for me, makes the editorial com bination of readings into an eclectic text more acceptable, because it is clearly not purporting to give us the text as transcribed or printed, but is trying to give us the words the author intended. Much of my editing has been of argu mentative prose, where there is little intentional ambiguity, great potential for poor punctuation to obscure complex thought, and an opportunity for the editor to help the modern reader access and understand early modern thought. But the modern-spelling editor has a mountain to climb, and the hardest task of all is punctuating. You need to understand the rhythm, movement, and meaning of early modern syntax better than an early modern compositor or scribe; you need to understand early modern rhetorical point ing and to be able to tell when a scribe or compositor is doing a good or bad job; you need to generate procedures for punctuating periodic syntax that don&#x2019;t break the rules of modern usage; and you need to be consistent, paying attention to the hierarchy of syntactic members in using dashes,
<target target-type="page" id="page_102"/>parentheses, commas, semi-colons, and colons in a recognisably systematic way. You need to think hard about the forms of words, also, so that you do not destroy or alter meaning &#x2013; so that you modernise spelling but not language. These are massive challenges, but if met they will result in an under standing of the text &#x2013; for reader and for editor &#x2013; that is seldom possible when that particular kind of thought has not been applied to textual criticism.</p>

<p>This is an old battle constantly re-fought. There are seductive arguments on both sides. The old-spelling enthusiasts claim that a new edition does, and should do, no more than make an old text available to today&#x2019;s readers, preferably with some notes to explain aspects that history has rendered obscure. The text, they claim, should be as close as possible to the most accurate version we have of what the author wrote. Modernisers, on the other hand, point out that history has gone well beyond the sixteenth century and that today&#x2019;s readers, especially young ones, need to be met halfway in their engagement with something as odd and foreign as a 450-year-old romance, sonnet, or defence of poetry. It is hard enough, they remind us, to sell such texts as interesting to the young whose communication is texting, Twittering, and Facebooking; let us not make things even harder by confronting them with odd spellings and curious phrasing.</p>
<p>I here break a lance for old-spelling editions, for fun and profit. Let us begin with the profit, in the noble sense of the true and right advantages. In the relatively rare cases where we have an author&#x2019;s holograph the argument is strongest. I spent many years editing the correspondence of Sir Philip Sidney; and one of the pleasures of letters is that except in rare cases they are originals. In such cases, modernising the spelling is moving away from what the author wrote. Preserving it, on the other hand, can give the reader information, not only about spelling practices but about individuals, their region, their educa -tion, and their writing habits. Elite persons such as Sidney wrote impeccable English, though even they might occasionally add or drop a final &#x2018;-e&#x2019;; on the other hand, a noted soldier such as Sir Roger Williams &#x2013; a fiery Welshman who was the original for Shakespeare&#x2019;s Fluellen (Llewellyn) in <italic>Henry V</italic> &#x2013; wrote in a spelling that was more individual: &#x2018;[the King of Spain] menes ether to perys or to be in england presently after stabelyshing any order in thease parts the which will be dun presently and will be cume mortall enymis vnto vs vnles we defend them with great reselusion presently&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_62"><sup>62</sup></xref></p>
<p>Sometimes the spelling of original letters shows us a person, as well as that person&#x2019;s aptitudes and restrictions. Lady Katherine Paget, Sidney&#x2019;s aunt by
<target target-type="page" id="page_103"/>marriage, was a baroness and educated; her little note to Sidney is charming but scarcely better spelt than Williams&#x2019; missive:

<p>Something would be lost if this were modernised: not only some information concerning the education of women, but a certain charm.</p>
<p>One degree less personal than autograph letters are manuscripts not in the author&#x2019;s hand but copied: the usual case when it comes to literary manuscripts of the sixteenth century, alas, as we have very few autographs. Clearly, in such a case the preservation of the original spelling does not necessarily provide clues to the author&#x2019;s orthography. Here, on the other hand, there are still arguments to be made for old-spelling editing. In some cases, the manuscript may have been copied by an amateur of literature, a general reader, who copies it into a &#x2018;commonplace book&#x2019;, a scrapbook of readings that have aroused interest and given pleasure. The spelling then is the ally of the handwriting in perhaps helping readers discover, confirm, or challenge the identity of the copier. The same may be true in the case of a professional scribe. Scholars working on manuscripts will usually have access to the original or reliable images thereof; and, as Peter Beal (1998) and H.R. Woudhuysen (1996) have shown, the traits of the handwriting are usually enough to identify a scribe such as &#x2018;the Feathery Scribe&#x2019; by analogy (between MSS) if not by name.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_64"><sup>64</sup></xref> In such cases, however, idiosyncrasies of spelling may be of supporting value. And for beginning scholars, who may not yet have access to precise images, details such as spelling, if preserved in editions their libraries may own, will help them begin to form theories.</p>
<p>We come now to texts of which the only originals we have are printed books. In these cases, it may be thought, arguments for preserving old spelling are weakest. And yet here also there are reasons not to modernise. A trivial example, to begin with: a word such as &#x2018;music&#x2019; has at least four or five different spellings in a printed Elizabethan text. <italic>Music</italic>; <italic>musick</italic>; <italic>musicke</italic>; <italic>musicque</italic>.
<target target-type="page" id="page_104"/>This seems arbitrary to the beginning reader; but even a slight acquaintance with the techniques of printing with moveable type will teach us that a compositor&#x2019;s line needs to be justified, and that variants of spelling may very usefully fulfil that function. Of the spellings of &#x2018;music&#x2019;, above, the first has five letters, the second six, the third seven, and the fourth eight. Add to that a spelling &#x2018;system&#x2019; where essentially a word was correctly spelt if it was recog -nisable, and rich variety results. To reduce such variety to a flat modern uniformity is to mask its historicity.</p>
<p>In certain authors, moreover, there is a wealth of wordplay that modern -isation would simply eliminate. Shakespeare&#x2019;s puns are well known, but they are mostly homophonic, as befits a writer for stage declamation. Spenser&#x2019;s puns, however, are quite a different matter. In the <italic>Shepheardes Calender&#x2019;s</italic> June eclogue, for instance, Hobbinol characterises June&#x2019;s pleasures as &#x2018;pierlesse&#x2019;, with a deliberate refutation of Piers, the moralistic voice of &#x2018;May&#x2019;. Further on, Colin sighs that if he had only a little of Chaucer&#x2019;s talent,

<verse-group>
<verse-line>Then should my plaints, causd of discurtesee,</verse-line>
<verse-line>As messengers of all my painfull plight,</verse-line>
<verse-line>Flye to my loue, where euer that she bee,</verse-line>
<verse-line>And pierce her heart with poynt of worthy wight:</verse-line>
<verse-line>As she deserues, that wrought so deadly spight.</verse-line>
</verse-group>
</p>

<p>In the gloss by E.K. that goes with the text, the spelling changes to &#x2018;poynt of worthy wite&#x2019;, glossed as &#x2018;the pricke of deserued blame&#x2019;. E.K., as Judith Owens has pointed out, chooses to pick up only that sense of &#x2018;wight&#x2019; that underlines Colin&#x2019;s &#x2018;wit&#x2019;, his &#x2018;wittiness in devising&#x2019; as E.K. puts it in his epistle to Harvey.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_65"><sup>65</sup></xref> There are hundreds of spellings in Spenser that work through suggestion or overtone: when Despair tells the knight that suicide is a good thing because the sentinel is permitted to depart &#x2018;at sound of morning droome&#x2019;, the drum carries an overtone of doom. Spenser&#x2019;s wordplay is almost entirely visual, and a modern-spelling edition of, say, the <italic>Faerie Queene</italic> would be both very nearly impossible and undesirable.</p>
<p>Is Spenser, though, an exception? Is it not kinder to modern readers of Shakespeare, or Donne, or Webster, to present them with a text they can read without constant rebarbative alienation, and so let them get on with enjoying it, producing it on stage, or adapting it to a film script? Well, it does depend on who the modern readers are. Those of us who love and edit Elizabethan texts all hope to reach a certain reader who is not a university student, not a fellow-scholar, but an educated general reader with time and taste. My own belief is that such readers still exist, but that it is not easy to know where. Most of our editions other than the most monumentally scholarly ones are aimed at either secondary school pupils, university under graduates, or graduate students. What, then, makes a modernised edition not only desirable but (to hear some arguments) almost mandatory? As an answer I would point to a reasoning that is in itself sound but has in the past been badly applied. My real argument for old-spelling editions is the charm of time travel. Such travel is neither expensive nor difficult. The conventions of Elizabethan spelling can be
<target target-type="page" id="page_105"/>learnt in ten minutes; the pleas ures of encountering it, of being <italic>d&#x00E9;pays&#x00E9;</italic>, last a lifetime. Moreover, being constantly reminded that this text belongs to another time helps prevent one imposing the often querulous demands of presentist values upon it.</p>
<p>Keats and his generation may have misunderstood aspects of the Eliza -bethans; but when he borrows Edmund Spenser&#x2019;s spelling to write of a nightingale &#x2018;that oft-times hath /charm&#x2019;d magic casements, opening on the foam /of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn&#x2019;, he is clearly under their spell. It&#x2019;s a good place to be.</p>

<p>The unexpected question came just as I was beginning to feel that my PhD defence was going relatively smoothly. Then the distinguished bibliographer and un-editor Randall McLeod looked down at the thick printout in front of him, turned to my preliminary &#x2018;Note on Quotations&#x2019;, and ever so kindly pounced. Why, he wondered, had I retained original spelling but modernised i/j and u/v? Why indeed? It was not a decision to which I had given much if any conscious thought. Surely this was conventional practice, the note itself reproducing boilerplate language I had seen prefacing numerous mono graphs? But I suspected that a reply along the lines of &#x2018;everybody does it&#x2019; would not suffice under the circumstances. So I found myself turning my heretofore rather inchoate thoughts on the issue into something approaching an argument. Maintaining the original letter forms, I suggested, created a distinction for readers now that did not exist for readers then: the &#x2018;u&#x2019; and &#x2018;v&#x2019; we see as two distinct characters, they, depending on context, saw as identical. By avoiding an introduced sense of difference, regularising typog raphy arguably brought modern readers closer to the reading experience of their early modern counter -parts. The analogy I thought of afterward was that maintaining the distinction between &#x2018;i&#x2019; and &#x2018;j&#x2019; in quotations from early modern books was like maintaining the distinction between the alternative letter forms &#x2018;a&#x2019; and &#x2018;&#x0251;&#x2019; in quotations from modern books. If I had been able to think more quickly, I might furthermore have added that the prose polemicists I was quoting, while conscious of style and language, were not playing with word forms at the level of, say, Edmund Spenser: the use of a &#x2018;y&#x2019; instead of an &#x2018;i&#x2019; in a given spelling in their work, for example, was unlikely to signal an allegorical forking of the path lost in regularisation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_66"><sup>66</sup></xref></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Professor McLeod, who had taken to using facsimile quotations as part of his &#x2018;unediting&#x2019; campaign, remained unconvinced. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s a
<target target-type="page" id="page_106"/>slippery slope,&#x2019; he remarked. Even as the rest of the defence faded into a blur, I found myself replaying this exchange repeatedly over the subsequent years. Modernisation is indeed a slippery slope, and McLeod&#x2019;s own work illustrates how much we can learn from an intense scrutiny of texts in their full early modern materiality.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_67"><sup>67</sup></xref> But the slope extends in both directions from any position on which old-spelling editions might stake their ground. Old-spelling editions, the general argument goes, convey a greater authenticity than modern-spelling ones: they recreate as far as practicably possible with out resorting to facsimile both what the author originally wrote and the reading experience of the original audience. One difficulty with old-spelling editions, however, is that they constitute more mediated representations of the original than they pretend to be, or are usually read as being. They promise more than they offer, and their gestures toward authenticity can actively mislead modern readers. Over the past few decades, for example, book historians have argued persuasively that material form shapes textual meaning: format, binding, quality of ink and paper, fount, typography, and <italic>mise-en-page</italic> are all legible. Old-spelling editions usually do not or even can not capture most of these potentially signifying elements of early modern books, and when they do imitate non-textual elements of the original it is unwise to base arguments on the assumption that these imitations are accurate. Modern readers who want or need to know what the original texts look like on the page are far better served by facsimiles (including digital facsimiles). Of course, facsimiles &#x2013; perhaps particularly the digital images available through resources such as <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC> &#x2013; are themselves more mediated representations than they are marketed as being. Digitised versions of old and often low-quality microfilms can misrepresent letters or punctuation (blotches can turn periods into commas or colons, for example), and the particular copy a facsimile reproduces might not be representative: <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC> promises &#x2018;the&#x2019; book but delivers only a given copy, one that might be missing pages, or have pages substituted from another edition, or feature a replacement title page, or not include cancel leaves, or be mis-catalogued in the database metadata and be a different edition entirely from the one the reader expects. Nonetheless, scholars who seek to take into account even such basic textual elements as fount and <italic>mise-en-page</italic> will employ facsimiles rather than rely on the approximations, fudges, and silences of old-spelling editions. Most significantly, any scholar attuned to all potentially signifying elements of early modern books still needs to consult original copies. Looking at actual early modern books remains the only way to build readings that take fully into account binding, binding context (bound singly or with other texts?), ink and paper quality, watermarks, provenance, and signs of reader engagement.</p>
<p>Facsimiles and original copies are consequently the way to go for readers interested in the full <italic>signifying potential</italic> of the early modern printed text. As for closeness to <italic>authorial intention</italic>, the &#x2018;authenticity&#x2019; that old-spelling editions promise in spelling and punctuation in most cases instead fetishises scribal or compositorial preference. While these &#x2018;accidentals&#x2019; (to borrow W.W. Greg&#x2019;s term) can be historically and linguistically interesting in their own right, they often have little to do with the author. Thus, for the great majority of modern
<target target-type="page" id="page_107"/>readers interested primarily in reading the text the author wrote, modern-spelling editions answer the purpose. Furthermore, while editions featuring original spelling do not pose insurmountable difficulties for most readers, even experienced readers of early modern writing can find that a modernised version offers a better accommodation of their normal reading practices.</p>
<p>These were the arguments I pondered when I mentally revisited that exchange with Randall McLeod. Over the years I encountered old-spelling editions that confirmed my sense of their potential to mislead readers in various ways, but I also remained aware that modernisation could indeed be a slippery slope. I registered the force of arguments against modernisation (see the citation from Philip Gaskell, for example, in Gavin Alexander&#x2019;s contribution to this volume at 2.3.2), became more aware of the role of press policy and the value of consistency across some publication series, and recog nised that modern isation, regularisation, normalisation, and old-spelling existed along a broad spectrum. All four solutions offered mediations of their originals (as, in fact, did facsimiles), and the degree of mediation could differ depending on a variety of factors, including projected modern readership and publication context.</p>
<p>I had an opportunity to put these internal conversations into practice when I started to edit the Martin Marprelate tracts (1588&#x2013;9), the notorious series of anti-episcopal satires printed on a secret and peripatetic under ground press.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_68"><sup>68</sup></xref> My goal was to produce a scholarly citation edition, but I also wanted to make the text available to a wide range of potential readers, including students and others who were not specialists in early modern English literature or history. So I modernised the spelling, and had no qualms about doing so. The most distinctive quality of the tracts is Martin Marprelate&#x2019;s colloquial, conversa -tional, and self-dramatising voice. Modernising the spelling and occasionally regularising some conventions of textual presentation, I felt, helped make that voice more clear and readily accessible to modern readers. I decided however on the same grounds to retain the text&#x2019;s early modern rhetorical punctuation. Re-punctuating the text according to modern syntactic norms threatened to change the Marprelate voice, eliding its oral and performative qualities. The Marprelate tracts were designed both to be read aloud and to represent the sound of public conversation that church and state (the tracts argued) had sought to suppress. The distancing effect created by keeping the text&#x2019;s unfamiliar rhetorical rhythms furthermore helped remind modern readers that Martin&#x2019;s was a new and distinctive kind of polemical voice even in his own time.</p>
<p>I did tidy the punctuation occasionally for clarity, but did so within its broader rhetorical framework. Again, I had few hesitations about this minor level of intervention, because I was confident my re-punctuation of individual moments of hard-to-navigate prose was altering compositorial, not authorial, punctuation practice. Unusually for works of early modern printed prose, we know a great deal about the day-to-day conditions under which the Marprelate tracts were produced: the hunt for the secret press generated numerous legal documents that reveal in detail its movements and workings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_69"><sup>69</sup></xref> The first four tracts were printed by Robert Waldegrave, using what documents call his
<target target-type="page" id="page_108"/>&#x2018;Dutch letters&#x2019; or black letter type. Waldegrave employed no semi-colons in these pamphlets, and he might not even have had one in his fount. He also lacked an exclamation mark, using a question mark instead in contexts in which an exclamation mark is clearly intended. For commas, he usually (if not quite always) employed a forward-sloping slash (virgule), by that time a somewhat old-fashioned piece of punctuation: evidently Waldegrave&#x2019;s fount had far more virgules than commas. The next two tracts were printed by John Hodgkins using a roman fount that con tained semi-colons, exclamation marks, and commas (but no virgules). In addition, the two printers differed in the relative heaviness of the pointing they imposed on Marprelate&#x2019;s text. In the pamphlets set by Waldegrave, commas appear once every 12 words, colons about every 100 words, and parentheses about every 250 words. Hodgkins is demonstrably more liberal with his punctuation, supplying commas every 9 words, colons or semi-colons about every 75 words (about 40 per cent are the semi-colons missing in the pamphlets printed by Waldegrave), and parentheses about every 175 words.</p>
<p>These two sets of publications offer clear patterns of compositorial prefere -nce in punctuation; there is some evidence for patterns of spelling preference as well. So I did not fear losing authorial intention by modern ising the spelling, being careful to retain all potential wordplay, and lightly tweaking the original punctuation for clarity. These changes included replacing Waldegrave&#x2019;s virgules with commas, the virgules being a function of his black letter fount, and adding the exclamation marks Waldegrave evidently would have used had they been available. Old-spelling editions, in their deference to copy-text, would likely retain the original&#x2019;s typo graphical features, even if they jettisoned the black letter type of which they are an element. As a consequence, the apparent questions that are not in fact questions could confuse modern readers, who might interpret them as a quirky or even archaic mode of interrogation rather than as evidence of Martin&#x2019;s up-to-date use of the exclamation mark as a rhetorical device. I also introduced a couple of paragraph breaks to make one section less alienating for modern readers, and regularised certain conventions such as biblical citations and titles. My one regret is that I was compelled for reasons of press economics to turn Martin&#x2019;s marginal notes into footnotes: the conversations between text and margin are a feature of the original <italic>mise-en-page</italic> I wish I could have retained. Martin Marprelate might have had similar thoughts about the constraints of publication on discovering his printer&#x2019;s lack of exclamation marks.</p>
<p>All that said, I am not an absolutist when it comes to modernising early modern prose: editions envision differing kinds of readerships; presses adopt differing mandates. I suspect that <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC> has sounded the death knell of editions that take a quasi-type facsimile approach: with full facsimiles readily available, there seems little point in misleadingly approximate versions. But strong arguments can be made for lightly regularised old-spelling editions. My current major project is in fact an old-spelling edition, the <italic>Works</italic> of Thomas Nashe for Oxford&#x2019;s Clarendon Press (with Jennifer Richards, Andrew Hadfield, and Cathy Shrank). For this edition, old-spelling and original punctuation seem to offer the best means of representing Nashe&#x2019;s highly
<target target-type="page" id="page_109"/>performative, orally inflected, and rhetorically and linguistically playful style. Nonetheless, careful decisions are required on such matters as paragraphing, punctuation, and (to return to my own introduction to the issue) regularisation of such typo graphical features as i/j, u/v, and long &#x2018;s&#x2019;, as well as of a host of other abbrevi ations, truncations, and other typo graphical elements. The edition poses numerous problems of copy-text as well, problems that full modern isation would solve but which pose chal lenges for a lightly regularised old-spelling version. Some of Nashe&#x2019;s works exist in more than one edition, with no obvious textual priority among them and, as with the Marprelate tracts, clear patterns of compositorial (versus authorial) preference in spelling and punctuation. As Gavin Alexander argues in this volume (2.3.2), modernising is difficult: it takes editorial skill and care to do well. The same is also true of regularising: old-spelling editions are not facsimiles, and regularising still requires editing, in the careful traditions of textual criticism.</p>

<p>When Andrew Hadfield and I set up the <italic>Modern Humanities Research Association (MHRA) Tudor and Stuart Translations</italic>, which launched in 2011, we had to establish some general editorial principles for the series as a whole.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_70"><sup>70</sup></xref> Since editors are mediators between text and reader, every editor needs to begin by making a judgement about the kind of text they are working with and the kind of reader they are working for. Texts from the early modern period have a number of characteristics which are not genre-specific: spelling and punctuation are irregular and unsystematic, and in print form these elements are usually determined by the printer, not the author (and remain irregular and unsystematic); as far as punctuation is concerned, a rhetorically based system was in operation rather than the system familiar to the modern reader, where punctuation marks out the grammatical structure of the sentence to clarify the sense; in the early part of the period, which coincides with the early print era, typographical conventions had yet to evolve from their scribal predecessors. Early printed books have one further feature in common: they are all available in electronic facsimiles accessible through both academic and public libraries. As far as readers are concerned, we tend to think of them as belonging to one of three categories: &#x2018;scholar&#x2019;, &#x2018;student&#x2019;, and &#x2018;general reader&#x2019;. For those in the first two categories who wish to study early modern texts in their originally published form, <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC> will almost always be sufficient. The general reader, it goes without saying, wants a readable text, but so do scholars and students.</p>
<p>The availability of <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC> helps to clarify the function of the edited text. The purpose of the edited text is to remove obstacles to understanding so that it
<target target-type="page" id="page_110"/>can be read and discussed as living discourse as it would have been by its original audience. Editing is ultimately directed towards the recupera tion of intellectual and aesthetic value. The function of the <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC> text is to preserve the historical record that lies behind the modernised version and to enable us to study a text in the light of the material conditions of book production and reception that obtained at the time of its publication. For scholars and students the ideal scenario would be to have online access to both the early printed text and the modern edition simultaneously, but all categories of reader need to have access to a text which makes sense.</p>
<p>These were the general principles on which we based our editorial decisions for the MHRA series, but others were informed by the fact that we were dealing specifically with translations. Translation is not easy to define as a certain kind of text, since all kinds of text may be translated, but it does presuppose a certain kind of reader. Translations are produced in order to make know -ledge accessible to unlearned or monoglot readers, so it seemed logical to make accessibility a guiding principle of a series of modern editions of these texts. Furthermore, the other characteristic of translations, which is that they are not &#x2018;authored&#x2019; in the conventional sense, has had the incidental effect of margin -alising them as literary works in their own right. The aim of the MHRA series was to reinstate these texts in the canon of English Renaissance literature, as they would have been perceived to be when they were published, so it was essential that they should be presented in the same way that scholarly editions of other canonical Renais sance texts are presented. The modern Momus who refers superciliously to the &#x2018;student edition&#x2019; or the &#x2018;Penguin edition&#x2019; (neither of which in fact can be relied upon to offer modernised texts) conveniently forgets that all the principal scholarly editions of Shakespeare are modernised; so is the prize-winning <italic>Oxford Middleton</italic>; so is the superb <italic>Cambridge Ben Jonson</italic>, despite the fact that Jonson is one of the very few authors of the period known to be interested in punctuation; so is the Longman Annotated English Poets series, several volumes of which are classics of modern scholarly editing. Although all these series have their own set of editorial protocols, as does the MHRA Translations series, each acknowledges that the primary function of the editor is to elucidate meaning. This first principle surely lies behind Gavin Alexander&#x2019;s decision to modernise the text of William Scott&#x2019;s <italic>The Model of Poesy</italic>, edited from a previously unpublished manu script.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_71"><sup>71</sup></xref> Anyone who still believes that a modernised edition is in some sense &#x2018;unscholarly&#x2019; should begin here.</p>
<p>This is not to say that no purpose is served by the publication of the original record of a modernised text. While too many academics seem to assume that early literature is only ever researched rather than read, the evolution of texts is a perfectly legitimate object of study and this may be facilitated by the way in which they are presented to scholars and students. Modern editions of early modern texts are not yet published alongside <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC> facsimiles of the copy-text, and the economics of print publishing usually prohibit that kind of parallel format, but some editions do present modernised texts <italic>en face</italic> with a diplomatic transcription of their manuscript source. The exemplary Chicago edition of the writings of Queen Elizabeth is a case in point.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_72"><sup>72</sup></xref> As far as
<target target-type="page" id="page_111"/>translation is concerned, the difficulty of producing the ideal edition is multiplied by the fact that there is more than one source text, for in addition to the copy-text for the edition there is the source text for the translation. The most desirable format for the purpose of studying composition and transmission would offer simultaneous access to all three versions. This probably represents the practical limit of the multi-version text. Editors should not be seduced by the possibilities of hypertext into producing editions which are not only unreadable but unusable.</p>
</sec3>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Editorial policy</title>
<p>That, however, is a rather distant ideal for the MHRA series, which at present appears in print (hardback and paperback) and in EBSCO eBook formats (<uri>www.ebscohost.com/</uri>). The editorial guidelines we set out reflect this relatively conventional form of publication and are also informed by the considerations just described. Each text is presented with a substantial introduction, explan -atory notes at the foot of the page, textual notes at the end of the volume, a glossary and (where appropriate) a list of neologisms, and an index. The introduction is followed by a selected list of further reading, and a more substantial bibliography appears immediately before the index. The texts themselves cover both classical and modern-language translation and include both single works (e.g. Gavin Douglas&#x2019;s translation of the <italic>Aeneid</italic>, which was the launch volume for the series, or James Mabbe&#x2019;s version of <italic>La Celestina</italic>) and selections from authors such as Seneca or Ovid. In the case of selections, editors have focused on works that were best known to the early modern reader.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Modernisation</title>
<p>Since the MHRA has its own set of editorial conventions and its own style handbook, volume editors are required to follow these but there is a policy on modernisation which is specific to the series. This is relatively con servative. What this means in practice is that the language of the original is preserved, but that spelling and punctuation are regularised in accordance with modern conventions because those are stable as well as being more familiar to the modern reader. The main problematic area for spelling is verse: obsolete spelling forms may add or remove a syllable, which can affect the metre. In general we would want to avoid making a line metrically defective, but this must be a decision for individual editors on a case-by-case basis.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Marginalia</title>
<p>With regard to print conventions, one particularly troublesome question was what to do with the printed marginalia, which are perhaps more prominent a feature of translations than of other texts of the period. We are not, of course, attempting to reproduce all the typographical features of the original texts, since that is what <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC> does. But editors will still have to make a decision about what kinds of marginalia might be designated typographical features &#x2013;
<target target-type="page" id="page_112"/>headings, or verbal manicules, as it were &#x2013; and what should be regarded as content. It is also technically quite difficult to reproduce marginalia in the same position on the page as they appear in the original printed texts, so where an editor has decided that a marginal note can be designated as content, it appears on the page as a footnote but is identified with a sign as marginalia.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Punctuation</title>
<p>This leaves the vital question of punctuation. Editors are usually less inclined to interfere with punctuation on the grounds that it is not superficial, as spelling mostly is, but a constituent part of meaning in that it operates as a logical system that signposts the grammar of a text. However, as noted at the start, sixteenth-century English punctuation operated according to loose, rhetorical rather than logical conventions, and it was rarely systematic. The colon, for example, was not used in the way we use it now, but as a marker of the rhetor -ical unit, the colon; punctuation-mark colons signal the separate rhetorical cola of a passage.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_73"><sup>73</sup></xref> At the same time, this relatively intelligible principle is combined with a redundancy of commas which sometimes appear (illogically) before main verbs and which may do the work of semi-colons or even full stops. Early modern punctuation presents the modern reader with many obstacles to understanding the sense of a passage, especially in the case of prose, and many of the texts in the MHRA series are prose texts. So we decided that editors should focus on regularising the punctuation in order to help the modern reader navigate the often rather convoluted syntax of early modern texts, particularly in the case of argumentative prose from the early and mid-sixteenth century, or in the case of an especially prolix writer like John Florio. Emending the punctuation in order to aid the sense is the most challenging task for the editor, but potentially the most valuable feature of the edited text for the reader.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Case study</title>
<p>I will end with a single example from my own edition. It comes from the preface to Thomas Drant&#x2019;s translation of Horace&#x2019;s satires and <italic>Lamenta tions</italic>, which comments on the way Christianity conditions our reading of the two works. One sentence that seemed particular opaque in the original text was this:
<disp-quote>
<p>Horace because he was not in any such time, wherin pretenced forwardnesse, was an harvest to those that pretended it, and a despoiling winter blaste, to that religion, wherfore it semed to be pretended: he never se, that with the view of his eie, which his pensiue translater can not but overvuew with the languishe of his soule.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_74"><sup>74</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<p>The essential meaning of the sentence could, however, be retrieved through re-punctuating as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Horace, because he was not in any such time wherein pretenced forwardness was a harvest to those who pretended it, and a despoiling
<target target-type="page" id="page_113"/>winter blast to that religion wherefore it seemed to be pretended, he never saw that with the view of his eye which his pensive translator cannot but overview with the languish of his soul.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_75"><sup>75</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I have, of course, chosen a particularly challenging example, and the passage still required further glossing, but erratic punctuation creates obstacles to understanding on every page of many early printed texts. This is one way in which editing adds value to the <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC> text.</p>

<p>I have been conducting something of a crusade as to how early modern manuscript texts should be presented in modern, printed form since I pub lished &#x2018;How to Edit a Seventeenth-century Manuscript&#x2019; <italic>in The Seventeenth Century</italic> in 1995; subsequently, I reiterated and refined my arguments in <italic>Editing Early Modern Texts: An Introduction to Principles and Practice</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_76"><sup>76</sup></xref> Do we want a text in which all the alterations and deletions appear as they do in the original, in the form of a kind of facsimile? And is it appropriate to try to reproduce such features of manuscripts as abbreviations denoting that a letter &#x2018;m&#x2019; has been omitted to speed composition, or that &#x2018;which&#x2019; has been shortened to a &#x2018;w&#x2019; with a superscript &#x2018;ch&#x2019;, in the form &#x2018;wch&#x2019;? Does it help or hinder the reader to be presented with such slavish reproduction of a scribal original in printed form, or is this an abnegation of the editor&#x2019;s responsibilities in presenting the author&#x2019;s text?</p>
<p>I am reminded of Lewis Mumford&#x2019;s famous expostulation on seeing the edition of R.W. Emerson&#x2019;s journals produced by W.H. Gilman and others according to the standards endorsed by the US Center for Editions of American Authors in the 1960s and 1970s. Mumford encapsulated this in the title of his critique in the <italic>New York Review of Books</italic> as &#x2018;Emerson behind Barbed Wire&#x2019;, and I feel rather the same about comparable practices in relation to early modern manuscripts. Indeed, if anything the onset of electronic technology has made things worse since Mumford&#x2019;s time, since the ease with which word-processing packages like Word make it possible to insert superscripts or to denote text as struck-through has encouraged a resurgence of antiquarianism in this regard in recent years. It is possible to learn from Wikipedia the names of the software designers who were responsible for the development of Word: whether they foresaw this particular consequence of the package they devised is less clear.</p>
<p>Let me first take the issue of manuscript letter-forms, and particularly standard contractions. Here, it seems to me that the key issue concerns the difference between manuscript and print, since the contractions in question are
<target target-type="page" id="page_115"/>quintessentially manuscript usages, which were not replicated in print in the period. If you look at extant copy for early modern printed books, you will find that &#x2018;ye&#x2019; and &#x2018;wch&#x2019; were invariably altered to &#x2018;the&#x2019; and &#x2018;which&#x2019; (this may be more universally true of seventeenth-century books than sixteenth-century ones, but the point still stands). Hence, the essential distinction is between manu script and print, in other words between handwriting and the use of mechanised letter-forms. Where, therefore, does a typed or word-processed text stand in this regard? I consider that, as soon as a text is converted from handwriting to typescript, it has passed through this threshold, and it is therefore inappropriate to replicate tricks to speed composition that are characteristic of handwritten texts. Obviously not everyone agrees with me about this, since transcriptions of early modern manuscripts featuring &#x2018;ye&#x2019; and &#x2018;wch&#x2019; continue to appear. But in my view such usages represent a solecism, and they have a further harmful effect, of unnecessarily obfuscating the text and alienating the modern reader. In addition, the inexperienced reader (for instance, the student) is unnecessarily misled by such usage. The cognoscenti know perfectly well that the &#x2018;y&#x2019; in such abbreviations is a substitute for a thorn and would therefore read &#x2018;y&#x2019; with superscript &#x2018;e&#x2019; as &#x2018;the&#x2019;: but those who con -front the usage for the first time often read it out as &#x2018;ye&#x2019; as in &#x2018;ye olde&#x2019;, and hence obfuscation turns to misinformation. Here, it is worth pointing out that those who reprint early modern printed texts long ago abandoned the practice of reproducing the long &#x2018;s&#x2019;, easily mistaken by na&#x00EF;ve readers for an &#x2018;f&#x2019;: why do manuscript editors persist in comparable archaisms?</p>
<p>Moving now to the treatment of deletions and alterations in an edition of a manuscript text, again it seems to me that there are issues of principle at stake. In this case, it is essentially a question of what we are trying to achieve as editors. In my view, we are supposed to be reproducing as best we can the text that the author intended. Now, when the author crossed out words and replaced them, his or her aim was to produce a new text, with the substituted words present and the deleted ones removed and, as editors, it is this revised text that we should be presenting. This is not exclusive of recording the changes and hence illustrating the process that produced this final version; but I think that this is best achieved by providing a clean text, with the record of the deletions and alterations that produced it consigned to notes. The alternative is to produce a quasi-facsimile, striving to replicate in printed form the appearance of the original by reproducing all deletions and insertions just as they occur. This may appear to give a sense of the process of composition, but it does so at the expense of intelligibility.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_77"><sup>77</sup></xref></p>
<p>Of course, it is possible to do both things at once &#x2013; to present both the final text and a parallel version with the text in its original form. This has occa -sionally been done in print, though it is rather wasteful of space.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_78"><sup>78</sup></xref> However, here electronic publishing has had a transformative effect, making it easy to offer both versions linked by hypertext so that readers can oscillate between them at will. This method is used in the online edition of Robert Boyle&#x2019;s <italic>Workdiaries</italic>, for instance, where it is very effective.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_79"><sup>79</sup></xref> But I am not sure that this is the end of the matter, since such hyperlinks only work electronically, and the problem will recur if nostalgia for the printed book means that
<target target-type="page" id="page_116"/>editorial projects continue to bring out printed versions of texts as well as electronic ones; it will also continue to arise when extracts from manuscripts are quoted in secondary works. Hence I reiterate my view that, if all that is being presented is a single printed text, a version with all the alterations shown in it is inappropriate. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that such texts are often barely intelligible, making the comprehension of the author&#x2019;s final version difficult and sometimes impossible. In my view, those who produce such texts have not given as much thought to the needs of their users as they should.</p>
<p>There may be a minority of readers who are so preoccupied by issues relating to the composition of a text that they do not find it adequate to refer to a separate record of alterations in a parallel text or apparatus, such as I have advocated. Here, however, there is the alternative of providing a reproduction of the original manuscript. In fact, for those interested less in the final text than in a writer&#x2019;s composition methods, such consultation of the original is preferable to even the most elaborate replica in type, which can never show all the details that an alert student would pick up from the manuscript itself.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_80"><sup>80</sup></xref> Whether or not in conjunction with such a facsimile, however, the best means of explaining the exact character of a text is through a commentary, based on the intimate knowledge acquired by the editor in the course of meticulous examination of it. I am not claiming that there is an absolute set of rules that apply equally to all manuscripts: I am simply arguing that our understanding of any text is inhibited rather than enhanced by superscript fetishism and the use of strike-through.</p>
<p>I also need to dispose of a fallacy, namely that different treatments may be appropriate to different kinds of texts. This seems initially to have stemmed from a distinction introduced by the Center for Editions of Amer ican Authors for nineteenth-century writings, who argued that a discrete approach might be appropriate for &#x2018;private&#x2019; documents such as notebooks, journals, or letters: it was the application of these principles to Emerson&#x2019;s journals that aroused Mumford&#x2019;s ire. But if this distinction implied that manuscript texts are intrinsically private, such an idea has been rendered untenable in an early modern context by the demonstration by Harold Love and others that scribal publication was widely used to make manuscript texts &#x2018;public&#x2019;. In my view, this means that a &#x2018;private&#x2019;/&#x2019;public&#x2019; dichotomy in terms of appropriate editorial treatment cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>This has not, however, prevented certain scholars from continuing to argue for a variable treatment of different types of manuscript texts. For instance, although Rhodri Lewis deploys a treatment similar to that advocated here in his recent edition of Sir William Petty&#x2019;s treatise on the order of nature, he uses a quite distinct &#x2018;presentational <italic>modus operandi</italic> &#x2019; when transcribing extracts from letters and the like in his introduction, which are full of superscripts and also include examples of struck-through text.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_81"><sup>81</sup></xref> I find this differentiation baffling. Presumably it means that Lewis would treat the handwriting of the same individual differently depending on whether he regarded the text in question as private or public. Moreover, insofar as editors who reproduce superscripts or include deleted material in their texts offer a rationale for such
<target target-type="page" id="page_117"/>practices, their arguments do not seem to me very convincing. For instance, Sir Noel Malcolm has claimed that, since the use of superscripts may occa -sionally have made words ambiguous even for contemporary readers, this is a reason for imposing them on modern ones.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_82"><sup>82</sup></xref> As for the view that deletions and substituted words can occasionally be significant and it is a shame to bury them in the apparatus, in fact readers can be alerted to such significant examples through a commentary without burdening the text with all the trivial changes as well.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_83"><sup>83</sup></xref> In my view, it is better to use a commentary to draw attention to such matters than to impose unnecessary obscurity on the texts themselves: it is thus that one can best do justice to the unique character of documents, which I am second to none in seeing as crucial. It is perhaps worth adding that it is equally possible to use a commentary to describe notable features of manu -script texts such as paper size, handwriting, marginalia, seals, endorsements, and &#x2018;significant space&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_84"><sup>84</sup></xref></p>
<p>Lastly, I would also contest Lewis&#x2019; assertion that obfuscation of the kind he advocates in transcribing private documents is acceptable because all potential users of such editions are scholars or embryo scholars. In fact, this seems unduly restrictive and it would be good to think that such texts might also reach a broader audience. Here, I am reminded of A.E. Housman&#x2019;s view that textual criticism &#x2018;is not a sacred mystery&#x2019; &#x2013; that whatever a student of the subject reads or is told about it &#x2018;he should test by reason and common sense, and reject everything which conflicts with either as mere hocus-pocus&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_85"><sup>85</sup></xref> I believe that the strategy advocated here best enables us at the same time to do justice to the character of the texts themselves and to the needs of modern readers.</p>

<p>In recent years, a small number of important edited collections have tried to represent in printed form the material features of manuscript letters, most notably Christopher Burlinson&#x2019;s and Andrew Zurcher&#x2019;s fine edition of <italic>Spenser&#x2019;s Selected Letters and Other Papers</italic> (2009) and Nadine Akkerman&#x2019;s magisterial edition of the <italic>Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart</italic> (2011).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_86"><sup>86</sup></xref> Nevertheless, such careful editorial attention to the &#x2018;materiality&#x2019; of texts is far from the norm, with many editors concerned to produce an accurate copy-text, but without reference to the physical features of handwritten letters &#x2013; such as handwriting, paper and manuscript layout, folding and seals, to name but a few.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_87"><sup>87</sup></xref> Indeed, in outlining transcription practices for editing seventeenth-century manuscript letters, Michael Hunter (as in 2.4.1) explicitly argues that
<target target-type="page" id="page_118"/>the editor should be concerned with &#x2018;the meaning that the author was trying to convey&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;the physical appearance of the document&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_88"><sup>88</sup></xref> Such an approach runs counter to an important body of recent scholarship that has highlighted the significance of physical aspects of the letter form which generated significant social meaning alongside textual and historical elements and are so fundamental to the ways in which such texts were readily understood during the early modern period to those conversant with epistolary cultures.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_89"><sup>89</sup></xref> In light of this material imperative, this chapter attempts to provide a taxonomy of material forms in early modern letters, as a guide for editors undertaking correspondence projects. A central aspect of this study will be to introduce the terminology of the different parts of early modern manuscript letters (for example, the address leaf, endorsement, postscript, seal, sub -scription, and superscription), and to argue that these discrete elements need to be recorded and described.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_90"><sup>90</sup></xref> Given the space available, this essay cannot provide a thorough-going, comprehensive guide to the material features of letters &#x2013; and I have written at much greater length on these elsewhere<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_91"><sup>91</sup></xref> &#x2013; but offers a fleeting sketch of <italic>what to look for when editing a letter</italic> before outlining the main physical features that might give editors cause to pause and think as they conceptualise and make editorial decisions about correspondence projects.</p>
<p>Inevitably the kinds of features editors decide to privilege depends on the nature of an edition and intended audience. If one views letters as opaque autobiographical documents that help add flesh to the skeletal biographies of &#x2018;literary&#x2019; writers, then a workaday, modernised, clean text might just about be acceptable (and this has traditionally been the case for historians). Yet I would argue this is to miss important features of correspondence that are of interest to a broader range of interdisciplinary scholars interested in letters in themselves, as well as wider early modern social and material culture.</p>
<p>At the outset I would like to attempt to furnish the equivalent of what might be described as a checklist of material and non-material features that should be registered or recorded, and in some way incorporated into an edition. In so doing, I am not reinventing the wheel: one of the best current checklists for &#x2018;letter meta-data&#x2019; was compiled by Oxford&#x2019;s Cultures of Knowledge team for harvesting information on early modern letters for their outstanding <italic>Early Modern Letters Online</italic> (<uri>http://emlo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/</uri>), and their freely downloadable ingest tool (which can to some extent be modified to tailor particular requirements) contains approximately 100 fields though very few of these deal with material features. A far fuller treatment of physical charac -teristics of early modern manuscript letters was under taken by the <italic>Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s Letters</italic> project (<uri>www.bessofhardwick.org/background.jsp?id=189</uri> and see 3.2.1), which produced a questionnaire with 21 broad categories of analysis.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_92"><sup>92</sup></xref> What follows is based on the <ITALIC>EMLO</ITALIC> and <italic>Bess</italic> templates.</p>
<p>In seeking to edit any letter there are key features that one would instinc -tively wish to register:

<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>the names of signatories and addressees (including biographical details of each and their relationships);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><target target-type="page" id="page_119"/>places and dates of composition, sending, receipt and archiving (in original and standardised forms, with inferred, uncertain or approx -imate dates);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the languages in which a letter is written;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the current location of the letter: repository, collection and call number (including folio as well as article numbers), provenance and printed manifestations (contemporary and modern), transcripts, facsimiles, or digital images in the public domain.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>

<p>Such basic categories of description are fairly standard in editions of letters as a way of contextualising and framing a particular letter, alongside perhaps glosses explaining the context of composition, people, places, and events men -tioned in the letter, and enclosures. Beyond these elements, physical features that might impart significant meaning include:

</p>

<p>Such a listing is necessarily partial and there are no doubt omissions, but it gives some sense of the broad range of material features that editors will encounter when dealing with early modern manuscript letters. The remainder of this case study introduces more conceptual questions of editorial policy, and a fuller treatment of issues related to scribal status and traits, significant space and paper, sealing and endorsements, among other issues.</p>

<p>Moving beyond the pedantry of list-making, perhaps the most funda mental question asked by an editor of early modern correspondence is: what is a letter? This question is at the heart of trying to establish a corpus of correspondence and relates not only to issues of genre, but also to the social practices of letter-writing. Should one edit verse letters separate from prose letters as has been standard practice, for example, in editions of John Donne&#x2019;s letters? How should one treat dedicatory epistles, texts dressed up as a &#x2018;letter from a friend&#x2019;, or other works that assumed epistolary guises?<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_93"><sup>93</sup></xref> The porous bound -aries between these different epistolary forms challenge our notion of the letter. Many editions of correspondence have limited their interest to the letters written in the name of an individual, sometimes including only selective items of correspondence received, despite the risk of skewing the picture of cor -respondence practice, ignoring the extent to which letters are often the deliberate product of cultivation by the correspondent. Another issue that the Francis Bacon correspondence project faced was how to deal with documents when Bacon was one of multiple signatories on, say, a Privy Council letter, or when he was the <italic>de facto</italic> signature on a Chancery document that took a quasi-epistolary form. Determining what constitutes an individual&#x2019;s corpus of correspondence for the early modern period, therefore, requires a flexible and pluralistic definition of letter-writing activities, and any new edition that seeks fully to locate an individual within the cultures of their correspondence ought to encompass not only those letters that he or she penned (including letters penned in a secretarial capacity, as with Spenser and Donne), but also those received, read, endorsed, archived, and even carried, as in the case of Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s correspondence.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_94"><sup>94</sup></xref></p>

<p>In the past, letters have often been approached as rather stable texts (unlike, for example, play texts or verse), with little editorial attention paid to ancillary material aspects, let alone to the scribal status of individual letter texts. Increasingly, however, scholars have shown that letters (as with other Renais -sance genres) might exist as a series of different manifestations, with textual and contextual variations that destabilise our notion of the fixedness of the early modern letter, capable of interpretation as two-way closed epistolary exchange. A material taxonomy would therefore delineate an alternative order of the letter
<target target-type="page" id="page_121"/>by paying attention to its scribal status, and distinguishing between original sent letters, rough drafts, personal copies, presentation letters, letter-books, &#x2018;circular&#x2019; letter, printed letters, and &#x2018;scribally published&#x2019; letters. It was perfectly possible for a letter to exist in successive and overlapping formats and to contain significant variations; such letters are, therefore, open to a more formal stemmatic approach of editing. Recent studies of the letters of Philip Sidney, Francis Bacon, and Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex have emphasised the scribal circulation of letters both in manuscript and printed form, with individual texts acquiring unique reapplications in circumstances divorced from the context of initial composition and reception.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_95"><sup>95</sup></xref> In light of these characteristics, some editions such as of Sir Walter Ralegh&#x2019;s correspondence and Steven W. May&#x2019;s work on Elizabeth I&#x2019;s holographs have recorded variant copies, but how far one should unpack and gloss this compositional and reception history is a matter for editorial discussion.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_96"><sup>96</sup></xref></p>
<p>Considerations of the scribal status of letters naturally involve discussions of whether letters are autograph (in the hand of the signatory), holograph (strictly, in the same hand throughout), or scribal. Recent scholarship has high -lighted the collaborative nature of early modern letter-writing, and stressed the complexity of secretarial practices, with letters written in various ways, including from notes, modelled on templates, or from dictation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_97"><sup>97</sup></xref> While senders were served by personal secretaries acting in a sole capacity, it is increasingly clear from the careful palaeographical and linguistic analysis by Christopher Burlinson, Andrew Zurcher, and Alison Wiggins of the secretariats serving Arthur, Lord Grey of Wilton, and Bess of Hardwick that we need to account for multiple secretaries dealing with a person&#x2019;s corres pondence. In such cases, individuals were assigned particular duties, delegated according to skill and hierarchy, and might be responsible for different elements of the letter (the main body, signature, postscript, the superscription and address, use of ciphers, folding and sealing, endorse ments), depending on daily attendance and availability.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_98"><sup>98</sup></xref> Letter-writing in the manner is procedural, and the task of the editor is thus to break the letter down into its constituent parts for transcription and where possible to identify variant scribal hands.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in this <italic>Handbook</italic>, Joe Moshenska (2.4.3) usefully draws our attention to manuscript layout in his chapter on <italic>mise-en-page</italic> and editing letters &#x2013; which of course has wider implications for various non-epistolary texts &#x2013; and the way in which considerations of (in)significant space have informed his editing of Sir Kenelm Digby&#x2019;s correspondence, where material and rhetorical strategies might work in tandem. Rules relating to the use of blank space, the placement of signatures for purposes of deference or status, gaps between the opening mode of address and start of the letter, the function of margins (and indeed the writing in margins), and whether a letter ran to more than one side, were all widely understood during the period. They were outlined in Renaissance epistolographies and regularly encountered across corpora of correspondence &#x2013; what might be termed the material rhetorics of the manu -script page. Throughout the period, the use of deferential blank space in the placing of signatures and salutations on the manuscript page was particularly prevalent in letters of petition alongside a rhetoric of humility, where the sender
<target target-type="page" id="page_122"/>sought to convey a sense of their own social inferiority or obeisance in relation to the recipient. In 1602, Donne in writing to his estranged father-in-law, Sir George More, employed deferential tropes in seeking a rapprochement after his clandestine marriage to More&#x2019;s daughter Anne: &#x2018;I humbly beseeche yow&#x2019; he wrote in one letter &#x2018;so to deale in yt, as the persuasions of Nature, reason, wisdome, and Christianity shall informe yow; And to accept the vowes, of one whom yow may now rayse or scatte&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_99"><sup>99</sup></xref> He sought to underline his contrition in this series of letters by signing his name in the extreme bottom right-hand corner of the letter, a sign of contrition which was a departure from his normal signing practice.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_100"><sup>100</sup></xref> How far it is practically possible to represent blank space (and indeed to retain original lineation) depends on publication conditions, but one method is to record measurements of unusual spacing practices, as in the case of Mary Sidney&#x2019;s correspondence.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_101"><sup>101</sup></xref> Some of the most sophisticated editing of letters though is now being pioneered online, by Lisa Jardine and Alan Stewart&#x2019;s Centre for Editing Lives and Letters (<uri>www.livesandletters.ac.uk</uri>) and Alison Wiggins&#x2019; <italic>Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s Letters</italic> Project, which allow for the flexibility of offering different transcription versions, and to provide digital images which in lieu of the original (even if in some cases they erase evidence of folding and watermarks) represent an approximation of the ways in which letters were laid out.</p>
<p>Turning from organisation of the manuscript page to paper itself, the size, quality, and number of sheets used is significant and worthy of further editorial consideration. Standard sheet sizes for most of the early modern period were approximately 305 to 350 millimetres by 420 to 450 millimetres depending on local conditions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_102"><sup>102</sup></xref> Common practice was to fold the full sheet in half, to create a bifolium of three writing sides, with the main body of the letter written starting on folio 1r, continuing to 1v and 2r if additional space was needed. The majority of letters were contained in one side, the middle two sides were left blank, with the address written on a portion of folio 2v (the fourth side) only once the letter had been folded up and the ends tucked in to form an address leaf. Obviously transcriptions of letters over more than one page need to register foliation in this manner. On occasion prolix writers ran to an extra sheet, which was placed inside the outer bifolium and then folded in the normal manner. Sometimes an extra sheet of paper or &#x2018;wrapper&#x2019; was used in which to wrap the written upon sheet in order to prevent bleed-through of ink and to ensure the contents could not be read from the outside. Drafts or copies tend to have been written on single sheets produced from bifolia cut in half. Paper use was imbued with social codes: deploying an entire sheet to convey a short message registered status or formality, as in governmental or business letters, while cropping sheets might indicate household utility or restricted circum stances. By the mid-seventeenth century, the size and use of paper significantly changed, whereby the folded folio sheet gave way to the folded half-sheet quarto (in other words, a full sheet of paper cut in half and folded to form four writing sides), and partly because postage charges varied according to weight, writers, such as Dorothy Osborne (and possibly Digby), tended to utilise more of the available page, turning the paper sideways and writing horizontally in the margins.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_103"><sup>103</sup></xref> Use of unusual paper or surfaces can reveal something about the material conditions
<target target-type="page" id="page_123"/>of letter-writing. Under extreme circumstances letter-writers utilised whatever materials came easily to hand: pages torn from books and scraps of wrapping paper. The Jesuit priest John Gerard conveyed secret messages written in invisible ink on paper used to wrap oranges.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_104"><sup>104</sup></xref> A letter from Elizabeth Wetherton to her mother was penned on a fragment of printed breviary with plainsong notation, presumably because paper was in short supply.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_105"><sup>105</sup></xref> Several of Donne&#x2019;s letters were intended as presentation letters, which accompanied volumes or texts, and survive either as manu script separates, or were inscribed in volumes themselves, or tipped in to manu script works. A letter to Sir Edward Herbert accompanied a presentation manu script of Donne&#x2019;s tract on suicide, <italic>Biathanatos</italic>, which appeared opposite the title-page, another accompanied a copy of <italic>Biathanatos</italic> to Sir Robert Ker,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_106"><sup>106</sup></xref> a letter to his former patron Sir Thomas Egerton accompanied a presentation volume of <italic>Pseudo-Martyr</italic> (London, 1610), and is fixed to a blank leaf at the end of the presentation copy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_107"><sup>107</sup></xref> Scribally these letters represent a different kind of epistolary text from those that survive as manuscript bifolia, and there is an imperative to treat them as gift texts in relation to textual enclosures and other related and accompanying texts. Likewise, analysis of watermarks (which should be noted where present as a matter of course) throws up idiosyncratic epistolary and textual practices, as shown by Mark Bland&#x2019;s work on Italian flag paper, an expensive format usually associated with the court and presentation manuscripts, and identified in certain correspondences.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_108"><sup>108</sup></xref></p>
<p>Finally there is a range of material features associated with the sealing, dispatch, and receipt of letters that are of interest to scholars, literary, historical, and otherwise, for the meanings they convey. The actual contents of letters &#x2013; the very stuff of letters for so many editors &#x2013; were in actual practice the last thing an early modern reader would have encountered. Instead recip -ients were confronted by small folded packets of paper &#x2013; and letters were folded in manifold intricate ways as a way of letter-locking &#x2013; which themselves communicated through social signs, codes, and cues inscribed materially within the form.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_109"><sup>109</sup></xref> The addressed leaf directed missives to recipients following standard epistolary protocols, with reference to person and place, as well as visual cues such as sketches of gallows that indicated urgency or import. Ordinarily paper packets were closed with a wax seal, which functioned as a device of authentication normally imbued with symbolic significance, and to guarantee security.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_110"><sup>110</sup></xref> Donne, for example, used at least three different personal seals, which had a symbolic potency: a sheaf of snakes, a wolf rampant sur -rounded by a sheaf of snakes, and after his ordination in 1615, a seal of Christ crucified on an anchor; a fourth seal of a heraldic antelope passant crined, which appears on a letters written from the house of his friend Sir John Danvers, may have been borrowed simply for the purpose of sealing.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_111"><sup>111</sup></xref> His new seal after ordination appears on a letter to Sir Edward Herbert, in which he refers to receiving &#x2018;a new character&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_112"><sup>112</sup></xref> The colour of sealing wax was likewise instructive, normally red, but black to signify periods of mourning; floss, or string, functioned as a marker of intimacy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_113"><sup>113</sup></xref> The opening of letters often resulted in the tearing away of seals, but tear-marks, remnants or markings of wax indicate that a letter was sealed; while the absence of seals may reflect
<target target-type="page" id="page_124"/>letters sent open, or drafts and copies. Sealing is thus integral to the status and nature of individual letters.</p>
<p>Just as the identity of secretaries or scribes has furnished invaluable inform -ation about the process of epistolary composition, so too details of postal conditions are central to understanding the extra-textual and con textual features of early modern correspondence. In a number of instances, letters survive replete with postal endorsements, which tracked the routes and timings of postal journey, indicating that they travelled by royal post; for others it is possible to uncover the identity of letter-bearers, who often conveyed oral reports or even read letters aloud; or to trace the carrier route along which letters were conveyed.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_114"><sup>114</sup></xref> The receipt of letters too generated further marks: secretarial endorsements and new sets of folds that aided reading and archiving, or holes that reveal that letters were pinned up or threaded onto string for temporary filing. Correspondence also often accompanied other texts, enclosures, and material goods. Donne&#x2019;s letters, as we have seen, con -veyed books, or presentation copies of verses and sermons.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_115"><sup>115</sup></xref> In such cases, letters only make sense when set in dialogue with other textual elements that made up the broader epistolary transaction.</p>
<p>Reconstructing these extra-textual contexts is an important part of how we read and interpret early modern letters, and are therefore central concerns of the editor. In sketching here a rather brief taxonomy of the material features of early modern manuscript letters, the aim of this chapter has not been to downplay rhetorical, literary, historical readings, and careful textual editing, but rather to suggest something of the complexity of the epistolary medium, and to stress the importance of these physical characteristics, with which modern editors must grapple, and find practical ways of translating them into print or digital editions.</p>

<p>The question of <italic>mise-en-page</italic> &#x2013; the physical layout of words on the page &#x2013; illuminates, with unique clarity, the conflicting loyalties and responsibilities with which any aspiring editor of early modern texts is confronted. A scholar in a library or archive will open a new manuscript containing a text that he or she plans to edit, and be confronted with a baffling mess: text distributed confusingly across the page in a non-linear fashion, passages crammed into the margins or between lines of writing as an apparent afterthought, abrupt changes in the size or orientation of the text. What is the editor&#x2019;s job in relation to these features? The first and most obvious responsibility is to the eventual
<target target-type="page" id="page_125"/>reader of the projected edition. If the text in question is difficult to read to the point of impenetrability, then the editor&#x2019;s task is surely to render it readable. This will mean tidying up the text, and conferring upon it an order that it seems at first glance to lack. There would be little point in an edition that makes the texts it contains as difficult to read as the original. There is, however, a second set of responsibilities, more elusive but no less important: to the text in question, and to its author or authors. The mess with which an editor is often confronted in the archives is, for better or worse, the mess that the author(s) left (For a detailed reflection &#x2018;On Mess&#x2019; and its editorial misrepresentation see Bennett&#x2019;s case study at 4.2). As soon as the editor chooses to tidy a text up, practical questions of editing become inseparable from the largest and most intractable questions of authorial intention, and the distinction between form and content. If, as an editor, I organise a text into a more legible shape, I implicitly assume that the author intended its meaning, but that its shape on the page is entirely incidental, lacking all intention. I assume that the text&#x2019;s content is independent of its form, and that I can reorganise its patterning on the page without funda mentally changing its meaning. These are dangerous assumptions, and they leave editors in something of a bind. No edited text will perfectly reproduce the appearance of a manuscript page, and if I attempt to do so I risk pro ducing a text that is useless for most readers; conversely, if I abandon original <italic>mise-en-page</italic> altogether, I risk occluding deeply meaningful, though non-verbal, characteristics of the original.</p>
<p>If this is true of all editing, then the problem has a particular prominence and tenacity when it comes to letters. This is partly due to their hybrid status as texts, and their relevance to different scholarly disciplines: as often private and intimate documents, letters seem to offer a form of factual immediacy invaluable to historians, but early modern letters were also highly self-conscious performances, and their rhetoric was integral to their meaning.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_116"><sup>116</sup></xref> The distinction between factual and rhetorical letters is ultimately impos sible to draw: the appearance of unadorned fact can be the most brilliant rhetorical performance of all. The question has become further complicated by scholars who have shown that the rhetoric of the letter goes beyond its verbal content. In a seminal article, Jonathan Gibson argued that &#x2018;the disposition of blank space in a letter could carry important information about the nature of the rela -tionship between writer and addressee&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_117"><sup>117</sup></xref> The standard handbooks of early modern epistolary practice instructed letter-writers to leave greater blank space between the body of the letter and his or her signature, according to the social status of its recipient. To omit such space altogether in an edited version of such a letter would be to occlude a profoundly important dimension of its originally intended meaning. Gibson&#x2019;s insights have b een expanded upon by James Daybell, who describes the &#x2018;relative ubiquity of knowledge concerning the politics and practices of manuscript space&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_118"><sup>118</sup></xref> There is a great deal riding, however, on Gibson&#x2019;s qualification that the use of epistolary space &#x2018;<italic>could</italic> carry important information&#x2019;, and Daybell&#x2019;s account of &#x2018;<italic>relative</italic> ubiquity&#x2019;. Once we appreciate that <italic>mise-en-page</italic> was potentially meaningful, does that mean it should somehow be captured or reproduced in every case? Is the editor&#x2019;s job to convey information about the organisation of words on the page, and leave it up to
<target target-type="page" id="page_126"/>the reader to decide whether to find meaning in them? Or should the editor determine in the first place whether a specific letter or body of correspondence avails itself of these conventions, and reproduce or omit to reproduce <italic>mise-en-page</italic> according to this judgement?</p>
<p>Self-consciousness regarding these issues has been on the rise among editors of correspondence. Even as important and textually self-conscious an edition as Noel Malcolm&#x2019;s <italic>The Correspondence of Thomas Hobbes</italic> straightforwardly decides to present the various facets of the letters &#x2018;according to a uniform format&#x2019; regardless of their original shape.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_119"><sup>119</sup></xref> Michael Hunter has argued trenchantly that, while scholars should attend closely to the manuscript peculiarities of the original, they should not aim slavishly to reproduce them in their editions, when this involves imposing on the reader &#x2018;unnecessary &#x201C;noise&#x201D; which has no significance&#x2019;. In general, he argues that &#x2018;line breaks. . .do not seem worth recording unless they are problematic in some way&#x2019;. Recording such insignificant details, Hunter argues, impedes the editor&#x2019;s proper aim of &#x2018;trying to do justice to the author&#x2019;s intention for the text&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_120"><sup>120</sup></xref> The problem with this argument, as I have suggested, is that it assumes we can draw a line between what is intended as significant, and what is not, but questions of <italic>mise-en-page</italic> problematise precisely this distinction. The practical response of recent editors to these problems has been mixed. Alan Stewart and Heather Wolfe are among the only editors who have insisted upon maintaining the shape of the early modern letter in their transcriptions &#x2013; retaining line breaks and paragraph layout, as well as the placement of the signature.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_121"><sup>121</sup></xref> In doing so, however, they were taking advantage of the luxurious space and flexibility afforded by the large pages of an exhibition catalogue &#x2013; their transcriptions of the letters appear opposite reproductions of the originals &#x2013; and to my knowledge no editor of a complete correspondence has gone so far. A judicious middle-ground is located by Christopher Burlinson and Andrew Zurcher, in their work on Edmund Spenser&#x2019;s letters. They preserve the layout of &#x2018;addresses, endors -ements, and subscriptions&#x2019; because these &#x2018;can carry valuable suggestive evi dence about the composition, receipt, and decorum of a letter&#x2019;, but they preserve lineation and indentation only in &#x2018;four special cases&#x2019; where it is judged particularly meaningful.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_122"><sup>122</sup></xref> This has the advantage of accentuating the potential significance of <italic>mise-en-page</italic> for readers of their edition, though it runs an inevitable risk in determining so absolutely the cases in which such features are (or might one day be judged to be) significant, and those in which they are definitely not.</p>
<p>My own thinking about these problems has been shaped by my editorial work on the seventeenth-century polymath Sir Kenelm Digby, whose dazzlingly diverse array of personal contacts and intellectual interests is evidenced in the surviving corpus of his correspondence, which numbers around three hundred and forty items at the latest count. As I have worked on these letters, I have become increasingly convinced that they are of interest not only for their content, but for the unusual persistence and self-consciousness of Digby&#x2019;s engagement with the conventions of the letter-form, often imbued with his inimitable swagger. As my appreciation of Digby&#x2019;s epistolary self-consciousness has grown, so too has my suspicion that it might inform the way in which he
<target target-type="page" id="page_127"/>distributes his words on the page. He was certainly aware of the conventions of significant space, but he deployed them with seemingly haphazard variation, even across a group of letters to the same eminent correspondent. Writing to the Roman scholar and collector Cassiano Dal Pozzo, he occasionally left a deliberately respectful gap between the body of the letter and his signature.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_123"><sup>123</sup></xref> Much more often, though, he chose to squeeze his writing into every available corner of the sheet, often rotating the paper as he went and filling each available margin in turn, so that the final product has the appearance of a spiral of unfolding thought, not a simply linear composition. These features present an editorial quandary. I cannot shed the feeling that something of the meaning of such letters is informed by the way in which Digby turns the page as he writes, and that something of his character is retained in the sprawling energy with which he deploys his words. But perhaps this is sheer sentimentality, a symptom of an editor&#x2019;s improper attachment to his or her subject, and has no place in an edition, where reproducing the shape of the letter from the manu -script original would significantly impede a reader&#x2019;s ability to read it.</p>
<p>The dangers of the stern self-scrutiny that might lead an editor to omit these features, however, are illuminated by a particular letter written by Digby to Thomas Browne in March 1642/3, which features abrupt shifts of orientation.</p>
<p>If this text is read in Geoffrey Keynes&#x2019;s edition of Browne&#x2019;s letters, where it has been most readily available, there is nothing to inform the reader that the original is anything but the sleekly linear text that Keynes provides.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_124"><sup>124</sup></xref> We might dismiss the significance of this letter&#x2019;s shape by explaining it away contextually.</p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_128"/>When he wrote it, Digby had been imprisoned by Parliament in Westminster House, making paper a scarce commodity, and he had every reason to fill every available portion of the page. This context is useful, but it does not end the problem. Browne had sent Digby a letter, now lost, when he heard that the latter&#x2019;s <italic>Observations</italic> on <italic>Religio Medici</italic> were being printed, asking him to wait until a corrected version of the original had appeared. In this, Digby&#x2019;s letter of response, he places unusual emphasis on the rushed and contingent scene of the letter&#x2019;s composition. He explains that his Observations were but &#x2018;notes hastily sett downe, as I soddainly ranne over yr excellent piece&#x2019;, and insists that &#x2018;what liberty I tooke, is to be attributed to the security of a private letter&#x2019;. Digby glosses over the fact that he had initially approved the printing of this putatively private document, and the emphatic occasionality and rushed, breath less courtesy of his subsequent letter to Browne is designed to drag his substantial, soon to be printed <italic>Observations</italic> back towards their epistolary origins and limit their potential offence. Digby presents himself as one who writes spontaneously and in a hurry, modestly reducing his learning to a &#x2018;superficiall besprinkling&#x2019; which &#x2018;will serve onely for a private letter, or familiar discourse with lay auditors&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_125"><sup>125</sup></xref> The physical layout of the letter on the page, I would suggest, serves his rhetorical purpose: as its words charge onto the verso and down towards Digby&#x2019;s cramped signature, he visually enacts the same epistolary contingency that his words to Browne stress. In this instance, it seems, Digby is not unthinkingly cramming the page with a messy cascade of words: there is a careful calculation to his decision <italic>not</italic> to make significant use of the space of the page, and this contributes to the total meaning of the letter. An edition that does not attend in this particular instance to the shape of the letter on the page &#x2013; or deems it a mere insignificance, irrelevant to the author&#x2019;s inten -tion &#x2013; will miss the manner in which this shape reflects the occasion of the letter, and the clever ways in which Digby responds to that occasion by making the seemingly insignificant use of space itself significant.</p>
<p>The exact form that such attention to <italic>mise-en-page</italic> might take is still open to debate, but I would argue that a footnote merely noting the point at which the orientation of the text shifts in the original is insufficient, as it is too easily overlooked or noted only in passing. If the text is allowed to flow on in unbroken fashion, this reinforces the sense that the meaning produced by the letter&#x2019;s <italic>mise-en-page</italic> is incidental or secondary. While an editor need not seek to reproduce the original manuscript layout, any given edition should discuss the question of significant space in its introduction, and return to the issue in discursive footnotes when a particular writer&#x2019;s use of the space of the page seems significant. I would also advise editors to consider disrupting the text of the letter at points where the original orientation shifts, perhaps by beginning a new paragraph or selecting and inserting a particular diacritical mark, so that an awareness of these textual movements remains part of the experience of reading. The example of Digby&#x2019;s letter to Browne suggests the delicacy of the problems that <italic>mise-en-page</italic> presents for an editor of early modern letters, and the risks of deciding too sharply which features of arrangement on the page do and do not matter. An editor should, at the very least, be clear about the criteria
<target target-type="page" id="page_129"/>by which he or she has selected those features of visual arrangement that are to be retained or noted, and not assume that the distinction between the incidental and the meaningful is stable or obvious. My own position is that an editor needs to strike a difficult balance in this regard: the text of a letter should be ordered so as to be accessible to its readers, but I do not think that there is anything wrong with creating a certain deliberate difficulty in the process of reading by marking line-breaks and other features of <italic>mise-en-page</italic> somewhat obtrusively, and thereby persistently reminding the reader that the printed appearance of the letters they are reading is often the outcome of an editor&#x2019;s reshaping. In this way the reader can implicitly be led to consider the meanings that can be produced (and effaced) by the mere organisation of words on the page.</p>

<p>When Jean Klene&#x2019;s edition of Anne Southwell&#x2019;s manuscript miscellany was published by the Renaissance English Text Society in 1997, scholars of early modern women&#x2019;s writing were excited.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_126"><sup>126</sup></xref> The manuscript had been pain -stakingly and accurately transcribed and annotated, with sensitivity to material features such as watermarks and hands. Its appearance in print would allow a wider community to read the original lyric and (lengthier) Decalogue poetry written by a remarkable talent, and to try to establish which material in her manuscript had been transcribed from manuscript and print sources. As a scholarly tool the edition is invaluable, but as a teaching text I have found that it leaves something to be desired. Students were confused by the layout of the pages in the edition. It wasn&#x2019;t always clear where a new poem began, and the references in the right margins to new folio numbers were so small as to be almost unnoticeable; they also competed with other numbering systems (line numbers given by the editor, and occasional numbering of stanzas or sections by the scribe). Titles of items were sometimes hard to distinguish from the items themselves, which was partly a feature of the miscellaneous nature of the manuscript itself, but it raised the question of what an edition of a manuscript, or of poetry excerpted from a manuscript, should do. If the edition preserves many of the features of the manuscript but the effect is too chaotic, then do the poems themselves get buried?</p>
<p>Klene&#x2019;s edition of Southwell&#x2019;s work suggested to me the utility of tampering with some of the elements of <italic>mise-en-page</italic> when translating a manuscript to a modern print edition, perhaps by enlarging titles and making new items clearer.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_130"/>As Peter Beal has noted, &#x2018;<italic>Mise-en-page</italic> (the French expression means &#x201C;putting-on-the-page&#x201D;) is the physical arrangement of the text&#x2014;e.g. features such as indentation, columns, spaces between para graphs, etc.&#x2014;but not the selection of words themselves,&#x2019; and that while the term usually applies to printed books it is equally relevant to manuscripts.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_127"><sup>127</sup></xref> When editors pay attention to matters of layout and placement in a manuscript or printed book they can reveal im -port ant details about the compiler&#x2019;s and readers&#x2019; choices. The first folio of Southwell&#x2019;s Folger Shakespeare Library manuscript (V.b.198) strikingly illus -trates the way a scribe can present a writer&#x2019;s work. The centred heading is, &#x2018;The workes of the Lady Ann Sothwell&#x2019;, followed by the date on the next line of 2 December 1626, incorporating several scribal signs and abbreviations.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_128"><sup>128</sup></xref> What follows are five numbered short lyrics, each called sonnets in the left margin, but as Klene and others have discovered only two of these could have been authored by Southwell, since three appeared in early seventeenth-century printed songbooks of the period. These three poems are not the &#x2018;works&#x2019; of Southwell, no matter how carefully written and judiciously spaced the copies of the songs are. On the following page is another well-laid out item in a different scribal hand, two columns of four six-line stanzas followed by a ninth stanza spread across the bottom of the page, three lines per side, with curved lines in the middle to mark line divisions. The scribe has elegantly accom modated all of the stanzas to the space available and the presumed author, Anne Southwell, has signed her name, centred, at the very bottom of the page. Southwell&#x2019;s angular holograph has corrected a few readings throughout the poem, but these are not the emendations of a poet correcting an original work. This poem is in fact another transcribed item: this time a version of &#x2018;The Lie&#x2019;, usually attributed to Sir Walter Ralegh. I agree with Klene&#x2019;s choice to identify the poem in square brackets as a title to alert modern readers to authorship issues. But the impact of the single folio page of the five songs, then the single folio page of the Ralegh poem, all of which is explicitly linked to Southwell&#x2019;s name and to no one else, her importance reinforced by neat scribal hands and an authorial signature, is a powerful visual statement of Southwell&#x2019;s (presumed) authorship. Un for tu nately these visual features, through which a reader first experiences her work, are difficult to recreate in modern editions.</p>
<p>Even a largely diplomatic edition cannot capture the way an entire manu -script opening looks. It is a rare press that can reproduce marginal notes as marginal notes: one fortunate exception is my edition of Marie Burghope&#x2019;s country estate poem (which itself is prefaced by an elaborate title page on which the title is centred), called,
<p>The Vision.</p>
<p>Or
<p>A Poeticall View of Ashridge in
<p>the County of Bucks.</p>
<p>The ancient Seat of the Right Honorable
<p>John Earle of Bridgewater.</p>
<p>Together with the History &#x0026; Characters
<p>Of the most considerable Members
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_131"/>Of that Noble Family.</p>
<p>Written by one of the Female Sex
<p>in the year
<p>1699<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_129"><sup>129</sup></xref></p>
<p>Burghope&#x2019;s marginal references decode the hyperbolic geographical and biographical references in the poem; preserving this presentation manu script&#x2019;s layout facilitates comprehension for modern readers, and illustrates what Burghope&#x2019;s illustrious dedicatee, Lady Mary Egerton, would have seen. Randall McLeod (writing as Random Cloud) has shown the importance of <italic>mise-en-page</italic> to the publishing history of Herbert in his absorbing analysis of the shape poem &#x2018;Easter Wings&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_130"><sup>130</sup></xref> The orientation of the wings matters: do you turn the volume 90 degrees to read the two stanzas? Which stanza comes first when you do this? And what about the space that some editors place in the middle of each stanza or set of wings: is that where an angel&#x2019;s body, or the speaker&#x2019;s body (&#x2018;Most poore&#x2019; and &#x2018;Most thinne&#x2019;), or the resurrected Christ&#x2019;s body, would fit?</p>
<p>Mary Wroth&#x2019;s sonnets and songs raise interesting questions for editors, since we have an autograph manuscript of poetry (Folger Shakespeare Library MS V.a.104), which differs from the printed sonnet sequence, <italic>Pamphilia to Amphilantus</italic>, appended to the end of Wroth&#x2019;s long prose romance, the <italic>Urania</italic>. Besides issues of additional or missing poems, spelling, punctuation, and order of poems, editors must also make decisions about <italic>mise-en-page</italic> for individual poems. Wroth has transcribed most of the poems, even when they are part of a numbered, inset sequence, on their own separate page, and has used scribal signs to indicate connection or closure. But Wroth&#x2019;s &#x2018;A crowne of Sonetts dedicated to Loue&#x2019; is unique in having all of its interconnected fourteen sonnets run together without breaks, in both the manuscript and the 1621 printed edition. The final line of one sonnet becomes the first line of the following sonnet, with the crown&#x2019;s last line repeating the first sonnet&#x2019;s first line. Modern editions might choose to show the circular structure of the crown, but it is less easy to justify the expense of replicating the manuscript&#x2019;s use of an entire page for sometimes just one sonnet.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_131"><sup>131</sup></xref> In his work on the 1609 edition of Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnets, Coleman Hutchinson argues that page breaks matter. He examines the sonnets that were printed across two pages in the first quarto and argues that this material choice has significant effects on readings of the poems. One provocative question he asks is whether it is just coincidence that twenty-three of the thirty-five sonnets anthologised in <italic>The Norton Anthology of English Literature</italic> (7th edition) are uninterrupted by page breaks. &#x2018;Does this anthologization signal a canonical privileging of monumental sonnets?&#x2019; he wonders.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_132"><sup>132</sup></xref></p>
<p>Another important feature of <italic>mise-en-page</italic> concerns the placement of poems in relation to each other. In the case of a manuscript miscellany, the compiler or compilers may wish certain items to be in dialogue. The answer poems in Constance Fowler&#x2019;s miscellany (Huntington Library MS HM 904), such as those between Katherine Thimelby and Lady Dorothy Shirley, indicate a conversation, as do the repeated symbols and design effects that Fowler adds
<target target-type="page" id="page_132"/>to some of the borders between poems, which encode authors&#x2019; names or suggest links between items.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_133"><sup>133</sup></xref> In other collections, poems of opposing view -points placed side-by-side can suggest the cut and thrust of debate, and the dialogic quality of manuscript culture, and so an editor who disrupted that placement could misrepresent a compiler&#x2019;s or a reader&#x2019;s experience. Or perhaps layout could also shield material from unprepared eyes: Claire Loffman suggests in her forthcoming edition of National Art Library MS Dyce 44 that the notorious poem by Nashe, <italic>Choice of Valentines</italic> (popularly known as &#x2018;Nashe&#x2019;s Dildo&#x2019;), may have been placed as the second item in the manuscript, after a satirical sermon with a Latin title, to deter the casual reader who might pass over a manuscript that looks rather scholarly and religious at first glance.</p>
<p>An editor of a single-author collection of poems should also be attentive to issues of layout, spacing, order of items, and the placement of marginalia and glosses, balancing comprehensibility with other bibliographic markers of meaning. The editor of the long-awaited edition of Hester Pulter&#x2019;s complete works chose not to indicate where the page breaks in the manu script appear, a reasonable decision since the poems run together in the manuscript, headed sometimes with titles and sometimes just numbers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_134"><sup>134</sup></xref> Occasionally those titles repeat when Pulter returns to significant concepts (such as &#x2018;The Circle&#x2019;, a rich alchemical image, and &#x2018;Aurora&#x2019;, goddess of the dawn, and an inspirational divine figure who helps guide the speaker of several poems). The scribal hand of much of the manuscript favours a neat, well-proportioned presentation but nothing fancy. Even Pulter&#x2019;s emblems do not require particular spacing or layout since, unlike most representatives of their genre, they do not have visual images to supplement their inter pretation; Pulter&#x2019;s fifty-three emblems use vivid depictions of elephants, porcupines, whales, and other animals and figures, to communicate her moral analysis verbally. <italic>Mise-en-page</italic> for a writer like Pulter seems much less significant than it might for a poet who could be communicating additional interpretive information through gaps, scribal signs, and precise sequences of items. Eardley&#x2019;s choice of five high-quality facsimile images in colour illustrates features of the scribal and autograph hands, as well as the careful spacing (with occasional use of marginal notation). Especially when editing from manuscripts, occasional or more extensive facsimile reproduction can be of use to a scholarly readership in particular.</p>
<p>Even if it is not relevant for every writer, paying attention to the physical appearance of items on the page, for manuscripts but also for early printed books, can give the editor another means to present information about how poems might have been read by contemporary and later readers. If a press has the capacity to allow reproduction of some of those elements, then the edition will be that much richer. When these details cannot be reproduced, then textual notes and analysis in an introduction can do a great service in bringing them to light.</p>

<p>What are the particular problems facing an editor who has both manuscript and print copy-texts? In this essay I am interested in questions and possible answers &#x2013; both theoretical and practical &#x2013; about presentation; that is, how to display edited texts on the page (or possibly the screen) when they derive from these different sources, and I will draw on my experience, and that of my fellow editors, in working on <italic>The Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne</italic> (hereafter <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_135"><sup>135</sup></xref> I am not concerned here with the potentially more knotty questions of selecting copy-text, although a number of the issues that I address are of course consequent on the decisions made at that stage and on the principles that informed them. My comments should be read alongside contributions in this volume on both modernisation (2.3.1&#x2013;4) and <italic>mise-en-page</italic> (2.4.3&#x2013;4), from which the reader will probably find a number of additional areas for debate emerging.</p>
<p>Of the 160 extant sermons preached by John Donne between 1615 and 1631, nineteen have manuscript witnesses. Only one of those nineteen did not also appear in print in the seventeenth century (it exists in three manuscript witnesses); of the other eighteen, which do have print witnesses, five have only a single manuscript witness. None of the manuscripts is holograph, the only appearance of Donne&#x2019;s own hand in his sermon output appearing in the autograph corrections to the scribal copy of his Gunpowder Plot sermon of 1622.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_136"><sup>136</sup></xref> However, even within the print corpus we encounter variety in terms of substantive variants (alternative wording, omitted passages, etc.), semi-substantives (paragraphing, for example), and accidentals (orthography, punctuation), since while six of Donne&#x2019;s sermons were printed in quarto during his lifetime (and presumably with some involvement from the author), the remainder were printed either shortly after his death in quarto or, for the large part, in the three posthumous folios, <italic>LXXX Sermons</italic> (1640), <italic>Fifty Sermons</italic> (1649), and <italic>XXVI Sermons</italic> (1661). It&#x2019;s especially noticeable in this regard that the texts in <italic>XXVI Sermons</italic> have already been subjected to a form of Restoration &#x2018;modernisation&#x2019;, with spelling being far closer to what a twenty-first-century reader would recognise than that found in the earlier folios or the quartos.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s pretty clear that what I have described here is not an especially complicated textual situation, even if my colleagues editing Donne&#x2019;s sermons from manuscript and collating their variants might wince at such a state ment. There is, for instance, no clear evidence of authorial revision to track down thorny paths (for a contrasting case one might consider Gavin Alexander&#x2019;s recent discussion of Fulke Greville&#x2019;s <italic>Caelica</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_137"><sup>137</sup></xref> Nor are there a great number of instances where a manuscript copy-text could be chosen. Furthermore, from the outset <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC> was conceived as an original-spelling edition, and so one might simply expect the copy-text to be easily presented as it appears, with little
<target target-type="page" id="page_134"/>editorial intervention required. This is the procedure that we have followed in the case of the different kinds of print copy-texts, with each allowed to retain its orthography and paragraphing. But issues remain which have impact on the reader&#x2019;s experience of these sermons, most pressingly the question of how, if at all, to represent or record such things as scribal deletions, insertions, and abbreviations (both commonplace, as the use of tildes to indicate omitted letters &#x2013; e.g. &#x2018;c&#x00F5;cern&#x2019; for &#x2018;concern&#x2019; &#x2013; and special, as habits peculiar to a particular scribe &#x2013; for example, the scribe of the Dobell manuscript (Houghton Library, Harvard University MS Eng D66.4) habitually writes &#x2018;DD&#x2019; for &#x2018;David&#x2019;). The problem boils down to whether this kind of information should be included in the edited text itself, or in a critical apparatus. There are good and strong arguments on both sides, and they have been expressed with a great deal of vigour by their proponents. Those who would like editors to &#x2013; in the terminology of school mathematics &#x2013; show their working and record as much as possible of the copy-text&#x2019;s detail in the text itself argue that this conveys some sense of the manuscript as an artefact, allows the reader to see the scribe at work, and avoids presenting readers with a &#x2018;cleaned-up&#x2019; text which never existed in the form now published. Those who would rather supply inform -ation about insertions, deletions, scribal habits, and so on in a separate place argue that readability must play some part in these decisions, and that no edited text can hope exactly to reproduce its copy-text in all its detail &#x2013; an edition, we are frequently and rightly reminded, is not a transcription or a facsimile (though Randall McLeod has argued that the only proper way of presenting texts that exist in multiple manuscript witnesses is by reproducing all of them
<p>in facsimile).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_138"><sup>138</sup></xref></p>
<p>As I have already suggested, a version of each of these approaches may be more or less suitable for particular textual situations: it is better, that is, to regard them as offering a range of solutions to different problems than to treat them as absolutes. Their results, as well as cogent explanations for their deployment, can be observed in the space of a single edition, albeit in different volumes, if one turns to vols VI and I of <italic>The Oxford Francis Bacon</italic>. In vol. VI, Graham Rees edited <italic>De vijs mortis (An Enquiry concerning the Ways of Death</italic>) from Chatsworth House Hardwick MS 72A. Confronting &#x2018;a uniquely grisly palimpsest of shifting intentions&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_139"><sup>139</sup></xref> where the work of a scribe mingles with substantial passages in Bacon&#x2019;s own hand and deletions and insertions abound, Rees chose to indicate with the use of different typefaces and a range of symbols (including four different kinds of brackets) the change between hands, material added or removed, interlinear additions, and marginalia. The resulting text on the page is far from being easy to read, but as Rees says, &#x2018;if an editor sought to give a just representation of the text as the author would have wished it to be, then the <italic>De vijs</italic> could not be edited at all&#x2019;; instead he &#x2018;adopted a conservative editorial approach&#x2019; which presents &#x2018;in effect a genetic text&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_140"><sup>140</sup></xref> Attempting to record the nature and sequence of revision in a separate location would in this case, Rees suggests, have made it impossible for the reader to reconstruct that sequence because of the sheer scale of those revisions. By contrast, in vol. I of the same edition, Alan Stewart relegates deletions, alterations, additions, and marginal material to a bank of textual notes at the
<target target-type="page" id="page_135"/>foot of the page, since he is dealing with &#x2018;non-autograph manuscripts, some of them in several versions with multiple variants&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_141"><sup>141</sup></xref> Only supplied letters are indicated in the text itself, by italic face.</p>
<p>Ultimately <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC> chose to present sermons with a manuscript copy-text in a fashion closest to that used by Stewart (one which also accords with the suggestions of Michael Hunter&#x2019;s <italic>Editing Early Modern Texts</italic>),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_142"><sup>142</sup></xref> again in part because we were confronted with non-authorial manuscripts. So, as with its print copy-texts, <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC> retains copy-text orthography, does not regularise i/j and u/v, and does not modernise punctuation; citational marginalia are retained in the margins. However, the use of thorn for &#x2018;th&#x2019; is modernised (e.g. &#x2018;ye&#x2019; to &#x2018;the&#x2019;); standard abbreviations are silently expanded (and where they include superscript letters &#x2013; e.g. &#x2018;wch&#x2019; &#x2013; these are lowered); non-standard abbrevi ations are also silently expanded, as are deletions, corrections, and insertions (including marginal insertions) where they have been accepted by the editor. All of these interventions are recorded in the edition, supplying the reader not only with the information necessary to reconstruct instances of revision but with details of a scribe&#x2019;s particular habits. Global changes, such as the silent expansion of standard abbreviations, are noted as part of the headnote to each sermon at the back of the volume, while local ones such as deletions, corrections, insertions, and the expansion of non-standard abbrevi -ations are described in a bank of textual notes at the foot of the page, keyed to the relevant line number and with a lemma. These textual notes also record the activity, where present, of different scribes.</p>
<p>Although these principles are fairly simple, they were arrived at only after a long period of discussion among the editors, at board meetings, and in correspondence. This involved calls for both more and less intervention; for the presentation of an even more interventionist text (orthography modernised; punctuation regularised) or for a more conservative one (the retention of some of those non-standard abbreviations). A particular sticking-point was the issue of expanding abbreviations more generally, since when dealing with print witnesses <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC> indicates expansions by underlining: could we justify inconsis tency on this question? A degree of pragmatism won out, since abbreviations are simply so numerous in manuscript copy-texts that a very heavily underlined (and thus less readable or easily reproducible) text would result from their retention. Once we had settled on our practice (and set it, if not in stone, in the minatory pages of our privately circulated Editors&#x2019; Handbook), we hoped that we had found a way of retaining some sense of the significant characteristics of our various copy-texts, and enabling the interested reader to trace the process by which the edited text had been established, while providing a text that was eminently readable as well as honest about its status as an edition. For those especially keen scholars who wish to follow the editorial process in even more detail, and who do not have access to the manu -scripts themselves, we have made all of our semi-diplomatic tran scrip tions available on the edition&#x2019;s website (see <uri>www.cems-oxford.org/Donne/Sermons in Manuscript). The inclusion in our edited texts of folio (or, in the case of print copy-texts, signature) references is intended to make comparison with the transcriptions or copy-texts easier still.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_136"/>What I have described here is a system that, we hope, works well for the texts being edited &#x2013; substantial pieces of prose with no authorial manuscripts &#x2013; and for the kind of edition being produced &#x2013; a multi-volume print edition from an academic press, with an online presence in the shape of the edition&#x2019;s own website and the gradual publication of its volumes in <italic>Oxford Scholarly Editions Online</italic> (<ITALIC>OSEO</ITALIC>). Different solutions might be more appropriate for different texts (there could be a case for recording revision alongside the text itself in the case of short lyric poems, for example), or different forms of edition (an online edition might find other ways &#x2013; even distinct from those used by <ITALIC>OSEO</ITALIC> &#x2013; of displaying various kinds of revision or intervention). The question of readership is often raised in these debates: who are we expecting to use volumes of <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC>, and are differing degrees of textual information required for different &#x2018;levels&#x2019; of reader? <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC> is never going to reach a &#x2018;general&#x2019; audience (whatever that is), for reasons of price alone; but even if some of its texts were to be included in a format, such as that of a student-directed paperback (Oxford World&#x2019;s Classics, say), I would prefer to see as much textual detail as possible provided. For that occasional undergraduate who wants to think more about where the text they are reading has come from, or for the lecturer who wants to include some consideration of editorial practice in their teaching, such information could be an invaluable resource. At this point, however, we are forced to confront not just issues of principle but of publishing economics, embedded expectations about what readers want, and many more in which the editor, even more than in the pages of her edition, is compelled to efface her/himself &#x2013; however reluctantly.</p>

<p>It would be more conventional for the titular subject of this essay to be in the plural &#x2013; &#x2018;Editions defined by venue&#x2019; &#x2013; but it would also have been misleading, because to my knowledge there is only one: <italic>The Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne</italic> (OUP 2013&#x2013;; hereafter <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC>). Each of its fifteen sermon volumes will be defined by a physical venue, or, in two cases, common types of occasion or auditory &#x2013; the courts of James VI &#x0026; I; the court of Charles I; the Inns of Court; St Dunstans-in-the-West; St Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral; City sermons; sermons for marriages, christenings and church ings; and sermons for gentry and nobility &#x2013; within each of which individual sermons will be arranged chronologically. This has been the intended presentation of Donne&#x2019;s 160 surviving sermons since the earliest inception of the project. It was unanimously supported by the editorial board, and warmly endorsed by readers for OUP, assessors for the successful applica tion for a Major Research
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_137"/>Grant from the AHRC (crucial to the realisation of the project), and by reviewers of the volumes that have appeared to date.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_143"><sup>143</sup></xref></p>
<p>This decision, though, went against nearly all earlier editorial arrangements of Donne&#x2019;s sermons. George Potter and Evelyn Simpson, editors of the long-standard <italic>The Sermons of John Donne</italic>, attempted a chronological sequence.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_144"><sup>144</sup></xref> Their Victorian predecessor, Henry Alford, had presented the sermons in his edition of Donne&#x2019;s complete <italic>Works</italic> in the order that they appeared in the three posthumous seventeenth-century folios.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_145"><sup>145</sup></xref> The latter were themselves arranged inconsistently, presumably by their publishers. <italic>LXXX Sermons</italic> (Richard Royston and Richard Marriott, 1640) aped William Laud&#x2019;s 1629 arrangement of Lancelot Andrewes&#x2019;s <italic>XCVI Sermons</italic> by liturgical feast day.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_146"><sup>146</sup></xref> <italic>Fifty Sermons</italic> (James Fletcher for Miles Fletcher, James Marriott, and Richard Royston, 1649) opted first for sub-genre (marriage, christening, and churching sermons), followed by groups that were in fact venue-specific (Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, Whitehall, &#x2018;to the Nobility&#x2019;, and St Dunstan&#x2019;s-in-the-West).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_147"><sup>147</sup></xref> And the last, <italic>XXVI Sermons</italic> (Thomas Newcomb for James Magnes, 1661) offered no discernible organisa -tional logic.</p>
<p>So why did we organise by venue? The answer comes in two parts. The first, simply, was that the revival of the study of sermons by historians and literary scholars since the 1990s had insisted, and proved, that early modern sermons were profoundly context-specific &#x2013; with reference not just to place of preaching, but also to the political moment at which they were preached, their liturgical or other ceremonial context, their original auditors, and the like. Considering sermons in these terms, ecclesiastical historians in partic ular found in them a rich vein of primary historical evidence (previously dismissed as too &#x2018;literary&#x2019;) for religious controversy in the period. Seminal here was Peter Lake&#x2019;s essay showing how &#x2018;avant-garde&#x2019; Lancelot Andrewes&#x2019;s sermons were when considered in the context of the wider dominant Calvinist culture in which he preached them, and, more specifically, the place in which he dared to make his subtle but pointed critiques of Calvinism &#x2013; the court of James VI &#x0026; I.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_148"><sup>148</sup></xref> It followed, then, that early modern sermons were not an undifferentiated mass of religious prose, but rather performed texts that had been written for specific people and specific places, and that many of these places were poorly docu -mented with regard to any of the institutional or even architectural details that had a bearing on how sermons for them were written and received. It was these issues that prompted my <italic>Sermons at Court</italic> (1998), and a range of subsequent major studies of other early modern preaching places and moments.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_149"><sup>149</sup></xref> These have all been received positively in their own terms, but they and their approaches also resonate strongly with other major trends in the wider field of early modern studies, including performance, textual reception, &#x2018;literature of place&#x2019;, and religion. Since scholarship now takes context, including place of preaching, as the fundamental starting point for any analysis of sermon texts, <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC> could, we believed, be presented in no other way.</p>
<p>So, arrangement by venue a no-brainer? Not quite. An edition can be expertly and richly historicised by other means, not least the time-honoured tradition of presenting collected works of an author in the order in which they
<target target-type="page" id="page_138"/>were written. One major drawback of this traditional approach for <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC> was the fact that volumes for any given date range would have within them sermons from many different venues. This would have obscured the focus on place as crucial in their composition and delivery, and for their interpretation. But also, it would have resulted in a huge amount of duplication across volumes &#x2013; as every volume that had a sermon from any given venue would, in its introduction and commentaries, have had to restate the same place-related facts. For example, since Donne preached at court throughout his entire career as a preacher, all fifteen volumes would have had to include an overview of the institutional and architectural features of the Chapel Royal and court chap -laincy. By segregating venues within a volume, the introductory and annotational matter can be both more in-depth, and also found in one place. For venues like St Paul&#x2019;s that require multiple volumes to cover their chrono -logical run, the first volume for it can contain the substantive overview of specifics about the venue, such as the architectural setting, to which subse quent volumes for that venue can efficiently refer, adding their own period-specific detail as appropriate. Inevitably there will be some repetition &#x2013; such as pointing out in all of the St Paul&#x2019;s volumes that sermons were preached in the cathedral choir, or that Donne preached <italic>ex officio</italic> every year on Christmas Day. But the more exhaustive explanation, and archival docu mentation, of that institutional detail can be done once in the first volume, and cross-referenced in subse quent ones. The fact that multiple-volume venues are themselves sequenced chrono -logically also allows the most targeted and detailed way to account for changes at that venue over Donne&#x2019;s time as a preacher in them &#x2013; such as the differences between the Chapel Royal under James VI &#x0026; I and Charles I (<ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC> vols I and III, introductions), or the impact of William Laud&#x2019;s translation to the see of London late in Donne&#x2019;s time as Dean of its cathedral (1628).</p>
<p>Potter and Simpson had presented the sermons in an attempted chrono logical sequence, and their example was not one to dismiss lightly. In addition, it would be dishonest to suggest that OESJD did not benefit, especially at the com -missioning stage, from the strong argument that we were doing something different &#x2013; that is, we had an attractive &#x2018;revisionist&#x2019; card to play. But as I hope this essay makes clear, our innovatory pres entation of the sermons was not for innovation&#x2019;s sake itself. That was the case not least because Donne&#x2019;s sermons present another serious problem for chronological arrangement: a significant minority of them are not dated. So, for their edition, Potter and Simpson had to speculate about many sermon dates in order to fit them into their scheme. They did so using mostly literary criteria (aspects of style) that are in fact highly subjective. And in doing so, they exposed one of the greatest weaknesses of chronological ordering &#x2013; the dubious inference that an author&#x2019;s work evolves in quality or &#x2018;maturity&#x2019; across his or her life. But their attempt even then was not successful, since a whole volume (V) had to be devoted to sermons that they could not date, thus interrupting the chronological sequence of the whole. The <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC> editors were also unconvinced that Donne had discernibly &#x2018;early&#x2019; or &#x2018;late&#x2019; sermon &#x2018;styles&#x2019;, so we were unwilling to repeat Potter and Simpson&#x2019;s exercise of speculative dating merely for the sake of a chronologically arranged
<target target-type="page" id="page_139"/>edition. Of course the dating of undated texts would be a priority for us as part of the editorial process. But we did not want to organise the whole edition around it, while we did want to make as easy as possible an approach to the sermons that was based on their intended original audiences. Fortunately for us, most of the undated sermons and all of the dated ones do survive in copy-texts that give the place of preaching. So, although we felt that place of preaching as the means to define each volume was our <italic>a priori</italic> preference for reasons of presentation and interpretation, it also gave us (and this is the second answer to the question, &#x2018;Why?&#x2019;) the perfect way to decide where to put all of the sermons that had no date in copy, but did have place of preaching.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the solution was perfect; no scheme, and certainly no edition, ever can be. Just as recalcitrant for assignment according to place as they were by date for Potter and Simpson have been six sermons on texts from the Psalms that survive in a single witness (<italic>LXXX Sermons</italic>), where they are titled only &#x2018;<italic>Preached upon the Penitentiall Psalmes</italic>&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_150"><sup>150</sup></xref> A sermon series such as this could equally have been preached at court, or Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, or St Paul&#x2019;s, and therefore within a date range 1615&#x2013;31; the sermons contain, for us, no discernible internal evidence for either place or date (perhaps because they were revised heavily by Donne after preaching). This was a problem which, at the proposal and planning stages, we hoped would be overcome as research was carried out on other sermons and venues, but to date they remain orphaned. Since these could have been preached at St Paul&#x2019;s, we will likely include them in one of the St Paul&#x2019;s volumes, but make clear in the introduction and through out the apparatus of commentary that the placement is purely speculative, and based on an absence of any evidence to the contrary. This is not ideal, but perhaps it is in fact appropriate, since modern textual editing has disabused itself of earlier scholarly fantasies that any edition could ever be &#x2018;ideal&#x2019;, much less &#x2018;final&#x2019;. We have decided to be honest about the exception, rather than to ignore or try to hide it.</p>
<p>The unplaced and undated Psalm sermons (a mere 3 per cent of the total number of sermons) have posed our only substantive &#x2018;problem&#x2019;. But the arrangement by place has provided not only the benefits that we were confident of at the outset, but also paid dividends that we had not expected. Attention to place &#x2013; including, for the first time, a better scholarly under standing of preaching patterns in institutions like the court, Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn, and St Paul&#x2019;s &#x2013; have allowed us to assign sermons to locations where Potter and Simpson could not, and in some cases with the follow-on benefit of firmer datings. Emma Rhatigan&#x2019;s doctoral work on preaching at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn had alerted her to the fact that Candlemas was a fixed preaching day for Donne at Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn; this will allow a better-informed distribution of unplaced and undated Candlemas sermons between the Inn and St Paul&#x2019;s. Similarly, knowledge of the weekly preaching rota at the Inn, governed by the calendar of the law terms, has allowed the Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn editors, Rhatigan and Katrin Ettenhuber, to make bold, but confident, identification of several sermon series preached in successive weeks, rather than Potter and Simpson&#x2019;s less well-informed assumption that they were spread across years on certain feast days.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_151"><sup>151</sup></xref> We have
<target target-type="page" id="page_140"/>also been able to produce and capitalise upon a refined understanding of differ -ent sermon auditories within the single venue of the court. David Colclough&#x2019;s work on one of Donne&#x2019;s Caroline court sermons in his volume led to a major article on the existence and characteristics of sermons preached for the &#x2018;below stairs&#x2019; congregation of the court department called the Household, some -thing entirely different from the &#x2018;Chamber&#x2019; of king and courtiers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_152"><sup>152</sup></xref> With Colclough&#x2019;s astute analysis of the sub-genre of the Household court sermon in mind, I was able to identify an earlier example of a Household sermon in my volume of Jacobean court sermons, something hitherto unnoticed because titled only &#x2018;<italic>Preached at Whitehall</italic>&#x2019;, and an identification that transforms Potter and Simpson&#x2019;s assessment of the same sermon.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_153"><sup>153</sup></xref> It is unlikely that any of these discoveries would have been made without the rigorous venue-specific focus of <ITALIC>OESJD</ITALIC>.</p>
<p>Finally, one might ask whether editions which present their texts arranged by place should remain a category populated by only a single example. Sermons, obviously, seem most likely to provide others. One could certainly imagine, with enthusiasm, trade or scholarly editions that showcased any number of particular venues: Paul&#x2019;s Cross is the most obvious, but that pulpit could also be profitably joined by early modern university sermons (Great St Mary&#x2019;s, Cambridge; St Mary the Virgin, Oxford); Scottish, Irish, or Welsh sermons; guild sermons from London or provincial towns; and of course the early modern royal courts. I have, ever since beginning to work on court sermons, been struck by the obvious correlative of Stuart court masques, any edition of which would be defined by venue. But that could be intriguingly enriched by an edition of masques and entertainments with sections devoted to, for example, Tudor enterludes, City pageants and masques, and entertain -ments staged by provincial magnates and gentry. &#x2018;Place&#x2019; could, I think, also find a rich application to geographical circles or coteries of manuscript authorship and circulation of verse.</p>
<p>But, whenever asked for advice about doing an edition of an early modern text or texts, I always demur on the grounds that I firmly believe that no two editions can be, or indeed, should be alike &#x2013; because the peculiarities of every author and text in any period should suggest, and sometimes even dictate, their own requirements about how they should be edited. Even though the decision to arrange Donne&#x2019;s sermons by place of preaching combined elements of both principle and pragmatism, I hope that it is seen as flowing from, and in sympathy with, the texts themselves and the conditions that produced them.</p>

<p>Partof the integrity of an author&#x2019;s works in the eighteenth century is the ordering of them. Editors in the period such as Edmond Malone and Samuel Johnson debated whether or not printed editions of letters should be arranged chronologically or by particular addressees. Alexander Pope arranged his <italic>Letters</italic> (1737) by correspondent in order to reflect the importance of classical ideas of friendship in his writing.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_154"><sup>154</sup></xref> James Boswell, on the other hand, in his <italic>Life of Johnson</italic> (1791), argued that chronological arrangement allowed &#x2018;an accumulation of intelligence from various points&#x2019; through which the reader might &#x2018;more fully&#x2019; understand &#x2018;character&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_155"><sup>155</sup></xref> This essay explores these debates about arranging epistolary writing in the eighteenth century and considers the consequences of such discussions for subsequent collected editions of eighteenth-century writers and the textual editing of epistolary archives more generally.</p>

<title>The example of Samuel Richardson&#x2019;s correspondence</title>
<p>In their general preface to <italic>The Cambridge Edition of the Correspondence of Samuel Richardson</italic> (2013), Tom Keymer and Peter Sabor address the question of how best to organise a writer&#x2019;s archive of letters for modern scholarly use. They first list the &#x2018;various characteristics&#x2019; of Richardson&#x2019;s &#x2018;surviving archive&#x2019;:
<disp-quote>
<p>the prominence within it of important interlocutors whose letters are otherwise inaccessible; its value as evidence of the book trade and literary culture of the mid eighteenth century, and as a capacious record of debates about major novels; the profoundly transactional or dialogic nature of the epistolary sources involved [. . .]</p>
<p>They then argue that the particular nature of Richardson&#x2019;s archive has &#x2018;two main consequences&#x2019; in terms of their own principles of editing:
<disp-quote>
<p>Most obviously, they dictate the publication of a full <italic>Correspondence</italic> in twelve volumes, as opposed to a one-sided <italic>Letters</italic> in four or five. They also argue strongly for the retention, albeit with necessary modifications, of a principle of organisation, correspondence by corres pondence, that was first established and implemented by Richardson himself.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_156"><sup>156</sup></xref></p>
<p>The rationale behind this way of ordering the correspondence is that Richardson ordered his letter books by correspondent and by corres pondence relating to each of his major novels, so the Cambridge edition of Samuel
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_142"/>Richardson&#x2019;s letters reflects the way the author himself left his archive to posterity. Individual volumes focus on, for example, Richardson&#x2019;s corres -pondence with his literary friend and early advocate, Aaron Hill and the Hill Family; correspondence with a range of women writers including Sarah Chapone, Hester Mulso Chapone, and their circles; letters with poets such as Edward Young; and then, finally, volumes of correspondence primarily covering the years surrounding the composition, publication, and reception of Richardson&#x2019;s major works: <italic>Pamela and Clarissa</italic> (1732&#x2013;1749) <italic>Sir Charles Grandison</italic> (1750&#x2013;1754), and his final years (1755&#x2013;1761). So volume nine of the edition, which I am co-editing alongside George Justice and Devoney Looser, consists of a range of miscellaneous letters about <italic>Pamela</italic> and <italic>Clarissa</italic>. It includes letters from various anonymous writers in response to the novel; letters from friends in the book trade; and various other letters from a range of acquaintances.</p>
<p>Richardson made indexes to his correspondence relating to each of his three novels, as well as an index to his correspondence with his friend, the editor Thomas Edwards. As an author who constructed a world out of the relation -ships and discussions detailed in his letters, the General Editors of this new edition have decided that by ordering them thematically readers will read them in the way that Richardson intended. More so than most of his contemporaries, Richardson quotes continually from his correspondents&#x2019; letters in his responses. In one instance he even numbered his paragraphs in order system -atically to address a friend&#x2019;s previous letter; she refused to do likewise because the practice had, she thought, &#x2018;the resemblance of slavery&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_157"><sup>157</sup></xref> The indexes that Richardson constructed for his correspondence are records of his self-conscious fashioning of himself as a coterie author. As such, the editorial arrangement of the Cambridge edition reflects this aspect of Richardson&#x2019;s sense of his writing as a totality.</p>

<title>Johnson and Malone on Pope&#x2019;s letters</title>
<p>This interest in epistolary organisation is not just a modern editorial problem. The question of whether to arrange letters chronologically or by particular persons was a debate begun in the eighteenth century by editors interested in ideas of textual authority. The debate was influenced by how Pope (the first English writer to publish his letters in his own lifetime to any great extent) had arranged his letters for publication as part of his works in prose. Pope, in the edition of his letters that he authorised in 1737, and his executor William Warburton, in a 1751 posthumous edition, divided the poet&#x2019;s letters under the names of his various correspondents: Jonathan Swift, Henry Cromwell, William Wycherley, Joseph Addison, and Richard Steele, and various women, whose letters are generally kept anonymous.</p>
<p>The Shakespearean editor Edmond Malone records an exchange he had with Samuel Johnson about editing letters in 1782, which occurs in the context of a conversation about the arrangement of Pope&#x2019;s works. Malone was thinking of bringing out a new and revised edition but wanted to arrange the works in
<target target-type="page" id="page_143"/>a different way &#x2013; in particular he thought the letters should be arranged chronologically. As he records it, he said to Johnson that Pope&#x2019;s letters &#x2018;might be better arranged in the order of time&#x2019; but Johnson disagreed with the following justification:
<disp-quote>
<p>P[ope] choose to class them as written to particular persons&#x2014;The most you have a right to do is by a table to direct how they may be most conveniently read.&#x2014;An author&#x2019;s disposition of his own works is sacred, &#x0026; an edr has no right to vary it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_158"><sup>158</sup></xref></p>
<p>In his <italic>Works of John Dryden</italic> (1800), Malone expanded on the effect of editing letters chronologically or by correspondent by using the example of Pope&#x2019;s letters. He argues that if the editor wants to &#x2018;honour&#x2019; a writer&#x2019;s friends then arrangement by correspondent is preferable. However a &#x2018;strict chrono -logical order&#x2019; gives the reader a &#x2018;history of the Author himself&#x2019;. The question is whether we want a linear biography of the author that sets him in the context of his times, or a more personal and relational rendering of the life. The latter, as Malone acknowledges, was the argument that James Boswell made for the chronological arrangement of letters and other writings in his famous biography of Samuel Johnson, which &#x2018;will make my readers better acquainted with him, than even most of those were who actually knew him, but could know him only partially&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_159"><sup>159</sup></xref> Boswell&#x2019;s argument suggests almost a kind of science behind the study of the author&#x2019;s mind. To a certain degree, Boswell used many of the letters in his <italic>Life of Johnson</italic> out of necessity because he did not actually spend that much time in Johnson&#x2019;s company, considering the length and significance of his relationship with him.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_160"><sup>160</sup></xref> It is an aspect of epistolary organisation that the editors of the first chronological volume of the Yale edition of Boswell&#x2019;s correspondence reiterate: the ninth volume to appear &#x2018;is essentially the first chronologically in its coverage of his life and times&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_161"><sup>161</sup></xref></p>

<title>Modern editions: letters and correspondence</title>
<p>Modern editions of eighteenth-century letters have been arranged both thematically, as with Richardson&#x2019;s letters, and chronologically. There is also a hybrid alternative as the editors of James Boswell&#x2019;s letters describe:
<disp-quote>
<p>The correspondence is appearing in three kinds of volumes: <italic>subject</italic> volumes of letters relatable to a topic or theme, such as <italic>The Corres pondence of James Boswell with Certain Members of The Club</italic> [. . .] and its companion volume, <italic>The Correspondence of James Boswell with David Garrick, Edmund Burke, and Edmond Malone</italic>&#x2014;the three mem bers of The Club not included in the [first] volume [Another volume] of <italic>Boswell&#x2019;s Estate Correspondence, 1762&#x2013;95</italic> [. . .] Then there are <italic>single-correspondence</italic> volumes, as between <italic>James Boswell and John Johnston of Grange</italic> [. . .] The final group consists of <italic>general correspondence</italic> volumes each spanning a period of time [.]<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_162"><sup>162</sup></xref></p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_144"/>In a note on &#x2018;<italic>The Choice of Documents and Their Arrangement</italic>&#x2019;, Marshall Waingrow comments that he has &#x2018;adopted a chronological arrangement&#x2019; to the volume of Boswell&#x2019;s correspondence relating to the making of <italic>The Life of Johnson</italic> on &#x2018;the assumption that the primary usefulness&#x2019; of the volume &#x2018;will be to students of the <italic>Life</italic> rather than to investigators of particular persons and their relationships with Boswell&#x2019;. He admits that this arrangement &#x2018;has made for some disruption of the question-and-answer sequence in individual correspondences&#x2019;, a defect that he attempts to remedy by inclusion of &#x2018;cross-references and the provision of an alphabetical List of Correspondents&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_163"><sup>163</sup></xref> This arrangement is a confusing solution to a complex and protracted editorial problem.</p>
<p>Horace Walpole&#x2019;s letters form a vast epistolary archive of around six thousand missives and replies. When W.S. Lewis edited Walpole&#x2019;s letters for Yale, he arranged the magisterial forty-eight volumes by correspondent, in part because Walpole, &#x2018;chose his correspondents with care, each was the channel through which one particular interest chiefly flowed&#x2019;. This reasoning informed Lewis&#x2019;s editorial method:
<disp-quote>
<p>The first decision in editing this work was to publish the letters by correspondences and not chronologically. The Advisory Committee, I believe, are now unanimous that this decision is the right one, since most of the major correspondences and many of the minor ones have a pre -dominant subject. It is my belief that Walpole selected his corres pondents with a subject more or less in his mind [. . .] A chronological arrangement would have destroyed this unity, and would have hampered the reader concerned with a specific subject.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_164"><sup>164</sup></xref></p>
<p>In contrast to Walpole&#x2019;s selection of addressees based on his own interest in politics, society, literature, or the arts, Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s letters are more casually miscellaneous, an attitude reflected in editorial treatment of them. R.W. Chapman writes in the introduction to his edition in 1952 that
<p>I have not printed Boswell&#x2019;s [letters to Johnson, as he] remarks more than once that Johnson did not &#x2018;answer&#x2019; his letters, which are therefore largely irrelevant to Johnson&#x2019;s &#x2018;replies&#x2019;. [. . .] On the other hand I have welcomed the opportunity to include Mrs. Thrale&#x2019;s unpublished letters, which though not very important are strictly relevant to Johnson&#x2019;s.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_165"><sup>165</sup></xref></p>
<p>A later editor, Bruce Redford, in outlining his &#x2018;<italic>Choice and Arrangement of Letters</italic>&#x2019; simply states that &#x2018;The letters are presented in chronological order [. . .] Undated letters that cannot be assigned with confidence to a specific year appear in Appendix I, where they are ordered alphabetically by corres -pondent&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_166"><sup>166</sup></xref> Where he deems it relevant, he includes some of Hester Thrale&#x2019;s responses to Johnson in footnotes, but by 1992 the overall decision to arrange the correspondence chronologically was taken as given.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Cambridge University Press edition of Richardson&#x2019;s correspondence once again raises questions relevant as much to today&#x2019;s editors as they were to eighteenth-century ones, whether letters are used as biographical evidence or interpreted more creatively in terms of the author&#x2019;s own self-fashioning. The decision to print Richardson&#x2019;s letters as arranged by &#x2018;Particular Persons&#x2019; is, as I have suggested in this essay, of ongoing interest to editors of epistolary editions. Letter writers do not always address their correspondents; academic methodology has become more consistent and professionalised since the early twentieth century, but also has to be balanced by the flexibility of an editorial response to individual archives.</p>

<p>Confining myself to literary texts and collections of texts found in manuscripts (in poetical anthologies, in miscellanies of prose and verse, and in what Harold Love has called &#x2018;separates&#x2019;, which can be booklets, bifolia, or single sheets),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_167"><sup>167</sup></xref> I think the first question to be asked is whether particular texts or collections of texts should be edited. This can be determined by several criteria. If we are dealing with work by major or minor canonical authors, a positive decision is obvious. For example, it is clear that the newly edited works included in the ongoing Oxford edition of the works of Francis Bacon belong in that project. An edition of the complete poems of the important manuscript poet William Strode is long overdue.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_168"><sup>168</sup></xref> Though many of the poems written by William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, were published in <italic>Poems . . . by . . . William Herbert Earl of Pembroke . . . [and] S[i]r Benjamin Ruddier</italic> (1660), mixed not only with verse by his friend but also with poems by other authors misattributed to him, his interesting body of verse merits an edition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_169"><sup>169</sup></xref> The many volumes of the series generated by the Brown University &#x2018;Women Writers Project&#x2019;, &#x2018;Women Writers in English 1350&#x2013;1850&#x2019;, were historically, culturally, and literarily justified, even though some of the women writers, such as Jane Barker and Mary, Lady Chudleigh, were little known before the late twentieth century. Though well known earlier, partly thanks to A.L. Rowse&#x2019;s promotion of her as a candidate to be Shakespeare&#x2019;s &#x2018;dark lady&#x2019;, Aemilia Lanyer still needed the high-quality professional editing of her work found in Susanne Woods&#x2019;s edition in that series.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_170"><sup>170</sup></xref></p>
<p>Another reason to edit manuscript collections is that they contain unknown or little-known (often anonymous) unique or rare texts that broaden our sense of the field of writing in the period. The apparently unique poems in some manuscripts, such as Folger MS V.a.345 and British Library MS Harley 7392, often constitute between ten and twenty-five per cent of their contents. Such verse, along with other canonical and non-canonical texts in manuscript com pilations, are valuable for being culturally symptomatic, revealing the
<target target-type="page" id="page_147"/>preoccupations, fantasies, and values of their historical moment. The (usually) heterogeneous collections from the early modern period may bear the traces of the social history of particular texts and groups of texts &#x2013; their origins, for example, in particular groups or social networks in such environments as the University, the Inns of Court, the Court, and the provincial houses of the gentry and nobility. The authors represented in such collections may have been tied by bonds of friendship, collegiality, or a common socio-political milieu such as the legal and political environment of the London taverns in which some groups regularly met.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_171"><sup>171</sup></xref></p>
<p>Peter Beal&#x2019;s ground-breaking work in his <italic>Index of English Literary Manuscripts</italic> (now in an expanded online form as <italic>Catalogue of English Literary Manuscripts</italic> at <uri>www.celm-ms.org.uk/) has resulted in a number of editions of manuscript collections of verse.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_172"><sup>172</sup></xref> In these, one gets information about networks of poetic transmission and circulation, about the sociology of literary texts, and about a larger field of writing in which most literate individuals felt free to compose (usually occasional) verse. This body of writing and the system within which it was immersed is different from the world of print culture and of the literary histories geared to the products of the printing press. Whether a particular manuscript deserves editing has depended partly on its interesting combination of topics, genres, and authors and on the uniqueness or rarity of some of its contents, not just on the quality of the writing and/or the notoriety of the authors. Especially now, as digital facsimiles of manuscript poetry collections expand in number and are made available online &#x2013; for example, by the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Perdita project of women&#x2019;s writing, and the University of Leeds Brotherton Collection &#x2013; more scholars will be drawn to approach these documents with the intention of producing editions of the most interesting ones.</p>
<p>Within the contexts suggested, the decision whether or not to edit unedited texts or collections of texts is an <italic>ad hoc</italic> one as well as a product of circum -stances, as I have discovered in my own experience. Several years ago a curator at the British Library, the historian Arnold Hunt, showed me a manuscript he was still in the process of cataloguing, Additional MS 82370, which was purchased by the British Library as part of a large cache of documents formerly in the possession of the Spencer-Stanhope family. This vellum-bound, fifty-folio, quarto household book has a fascinating collection of texts &#x2013; some familiar, some quite unfamiliar: these include two unique copies of ballads about Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s procession through London to St. Paul&#x2019;s to give thanks for the 1588 victory over the Spanish Armada (apparently printed in their own time, but with no other surviving copies in print or manuscript) and a long (512-line) historical folk ballad about a mid-fourteenth-century West York shire feud between members of the Eland and Beaumont families &#x2013; the latter found in other manuscripts and in some print versions, but not visible in ballad histories and literary histories. These texts needed editing and the rest of the collection invited careful study. Steven May and I agreed to collaborate in editing and inter preting the contents of this manuscript, producing finally a book published by Cornell University Press in 2014, <italic>Ink, Stink Bait, Revenge, and Queen Elizabeth: The Household Book of John Hanson</italic>.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_148"/>By examining other documents in various archives in Yorkshire, May was able to identify the main hand of the manuscript as that of John Hanson of Rastrick, Yorkshire, whose grand-daughter married into the socially ascending Stanhope family that had substantial residences able to preserve a middle-class manuscript that otherwise would probably have been lost.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_173"><sup>173</sup></xref> Hanson was a yeoman who worked as a legal agent, drawing up wills and real estate papers. His son was responsible for a manuscript containing illuminated heraldic shields, and the presence in the Hanson manuscript of recipes for different-coloured inks suggests that the father also engaged in this activity. Other utilitarian material found in the first eleven folios of the manuscript and scattered throughout include recipes for fish bait, instruc tions on how to catch fowl and to moisten and glue parchment (the material used for real estate documents), a verse calendar, a list of the tenants of Netherwood house and lands in Rastrick, and a model legal document. Religious and devotional material in the manuscript includes a verse Decalogue and a Nativity poem. The heterogeneous contents of Add. 82370 resemble those of some of the other middle-class household books from the period, not many of which collections survive.</p>
<p>The Eland&#x2013;Beaumont narrative is found in both prose and poetic forms: it is the only known example of a sixteenth-century historical ballad found with the prose history of the events &#x2013; which, in this case, offers an extension of the narrative beyond the conclusion reached in the poetic version. The two Armada Thanksgiving ballads are not the only texts associated with Queen Elizabeth: the manuscript has two poems attributed to her &#x2013; the first her famous admonitory lyric written in the wake of the Northern Rebellion, &#x2018;The Doubt of Future Foes&#x2019;, and the second the poem &#x2018;Now leave and let me rest&#x2019; which is probably a mistaken (or at least doubtful) attribution to her. Other items in the manuscript include elegies for members of the locally prominent Savile family and for William Herbert earl of Pembroke (d. 1570), Lord Vaux&#x2019;s much printed poem &#x2018;I lothe that I did love&#x2019;, and, at the end in another hand, a list of the counties of England and Wales with the number of parishes in each.</p>
<p>The first question to address after deciding that the mostly unedited texts of this manuscript needed editing was in which form the contents of this manu -script should be presented. A conventional edition of manuscript miscel lany or poetical anthology contains a historical and textual intro duction, the edited texts in the order of their appearance, along with a textual apparatus showing textual variants (where relevant) and glosses, a com mentary section, bibli ography, and index. Since some of the texts within our manuscript were disproportionately important and some, such as the many recipes for ink, not wise to include fully, we decided to make a compromise between an edition and a critical study, dividing the whole into several chapters, within which we could preface the edited items with discussion of their contexts, present a semi-modernised text, gloss unfamiliar words in the margin and in some notes, and follow the texts proper with textual analysis, in some cases including, for texts with a complicated textual history, textual variants and, in some cases, stemmata showing the rela tionship of the Hanson text to other surviving manu -script and print texts. This arrangement allowed us to give, in two chapters
<target target-type="page" id="page_149"/>that contain extended historical and literary analyses, greater space to the prose history and ballad about the Eland-Beaumont feud and to the Armada Thanksgiving ballads. The longest chapter of the book we produced is the one dealing with the Eland-Beaumont texts &#x2013; not only because these are the longest ones we edited, but also because they demanded treatment of a number of contexts necessary for a critical understanding of them. We discuss their relationship both to the original historical events two centuries earlier which they transform to suit the new historical circumstances surrounding their com -position in the 1530s; the place of the historical ballad in ballad history (including a comparison to other similar sixteenth-century folk ballads) and in relation to the generic conventions of the ballad; the relevance of the ballad both to the time of its composition in the late 1530s and to the time of its transcription in Hanson&#x2019;s manuscript toward the end of the sixteenth century; and the textual history of the ballad through the eighteenth century. The chapter on the Armada Thanksgiving ballads prefaces the edition of these texts with an extended discussion of the overlapping local, national, and international contexts of the Thanksgiving celebration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_174"><sup>174</sup></xref> The other chapters of the study, which discuss and present edited texts of most of the other items in Hanson&#x2019;s collection, deal with verse and prose copied from other printed sources, other texts drawn from manuscript sources, and the utilitarian items found in the collection. The introductory material for each of these chapters is shorter than that for the first two, and some of the interpretive material is placed as prefatory material to the individual texts included.</p>
<p>The book Steven May and I finally produced is neither fish nor fowl, but, we believe, it reaches a good compromise between a critical study and a conventional edition. The texts we want made available to readers are there in accessible, semi-diplomatic form and the extensive analyses and interpre tations offered are those needed to situate them historically, literarily, and textually. We believe that the document we chose to study and edit dictated the form in which we finally presented it. The editing and analyses of other manuscripts, I suggest, should be dictated by the specific character of document selected. In most cases, the scholarly editions of manuscripts already produced will offer the best models for the future, but, in some cases, such as the one with which we were dealing, a different procedure might be preferable. Especially in the case of truly miscellaneous collections that mix literary texts with large amounts of utilitarian and ephemeral material, it might make sense not to edit every item as a precious text. On the other hand, since ignoring this material distorts the contexts in which we encounter a lot of literary texts in such documents, we should call attention to it because of its cultural and historical significance. Although we need to take into account the immediate textual environment in which the individual works that we chose to edit are found because there is much to gain hermeneutically by examining it, the juxta -positions of different kinds of texts in many interesting documents that survive from the period can be acknowledged and interpreted without editing every one of them . . .</p>

<p>The preceding essay by Arthur Marotti discusses manuscript miscellanies of various kinds, and raises a number of editorial questions related to them &#x2013; the different kinds of writing that we might hope to discover in these manuscripts (and often only there), what they can reveal about early modern literary and cultural history when properly edited, how they should be selected for editing, and how their editors should present them. In partic ular, Marotti shows that by selecting and editing individual manuscript miscellanies in their entirety, scholars can present previously unpublished texts within their historical and transmissional contexts. My short chapter takes a complementary approach to Marotti&#x2019;s: I want to consider the process of editing from manuscript miscel -lanies, rather than editing the miscellanies themselves, and would like to focus upon a particular issue &#x2013; single-author editions. Marotti&#x2019;s essay suggests that edited miscellanies can complement, or even challenge, this traditional model of textual editing; so do single-author editions still have a place in a scholarly world in which editions of individual manuscripts are ever more widely available, and what relevance do manuscript miscellanies have to them?</p>
<p>One very simple (and very well-rehearsed) answer to this question lies in the editorial apparatus. A great deal of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century poetry, as is widely appreciated, was circulated and transmitted in manu scripts of various kinds, including miscellanies, long before it was printed, if indeed it ever was. The compilers of single-author editions, especially editions of authors who did not prepare their texts for the press or whose writings were never published in their lifetimes, can undertake recensional studies of the surviving manuscript and print witnesses &#x2013; that is, studies that attempt to discover the witnesses closest to the original versions (or to a subsequent authorial revision) and the process by which they were altered and changed &#x2013; and presenting this evidence in their textual notes. They may wish to use these early versions as copy-texts, and in their textual notes can document the relationships, such as they can be ascertained, between the different surviving copies. In some cases (as, for instance, in Harold Love&#x2019;s monumental edition of the poems of John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_175"><sup>175</sup></xref> such editors might present alternative versions of single texts, to show the variety of contemporary ways in which texts were transmitted, and can also choose to follow the accidental characteristics of their manuscript copy-texts, often deriving from different manuscripts and in the hands of different scribes, thereby presenting an author whose texts are marked by orthographical difference rather than the imposed unity of a single print shop compositor.</p>
<p>Conversely, editorial work on individual authors might tell us something about the manuscript miscellanies themselves. When extended across an entire edition (or over groups of editions), textual apparatuses will gradually reveal
<target target-type="page" id="page_151"/>something about the relations between individual manuscript miscel lanies, about patterns of copying and transmission, about the transition from manuscript to printed collections, and so on. In other words, it may well be that a more traditional model of textual editing (gathering together all of the texts written by a single author) might, by considering evidence from different manuscripts and miscellanies, have something uniquely accessible from this type of editing to tell us about those manuscripts themselves. This makes it all the more important, of course, that author-centric editors are as comprehensive as possible in their apparatuses, and as consistent as poss ible in their editorial conventions &#x2013; and also that they exploit the electronic resources that might enable them and their colleagues to collate their findings between editions. Not necessarily a key to all mythologies, but a key to all editions: this might help us to understand more and more about individual manuscript miscellanies themselves.</p>
<p>But editing from manuscript miscellanies might also lead to some more fundamental changes in the way in which we regard single-author editions. Let me give one example from an author whom I am currently editing &#x2013; Richard Corbett, Bishop of Oxford and Norwich (1582&#x2013;1635). To judge from the evidence in Peter Beal&#x2019;s <italic>Catalogue of English Literary Manuscripts</italic>, Corbett was one of the most widely transcribed poets of the first half of the seventeenth century, though one whose poems were not printed in collections until more than ten years after his death: <italic>Certain Elegant Poems</italic>, Written by Dr Corbet, Bishop of Norwich (1647) and <italic>Po&#x00EB;tica Stromata</italic> (1648). Even these printed collections, though, are not complete, and a number of his poems, including a series of short verses written in the last years of his life in Norwich, are known to survive only in one or two manuscript miscellanies. Elsewhere, Corbett&#x2019;s poems appear in dozens of miscellanies, sometimes anonymous, sometimes misattributed (alongside a number of other poems attributed to him but generally believed to be written by his Oxford contemporaries such as his chaplain, William Strode, or by Henry King).</p>
<p>In 1628, Corbett wrote a poem criticising the Parliament of that year, which had presented a Petition of Right to King Charles, asking the King to acknowledge that he could levy taxes (including the customs duties of poundage and tonnage) only with Parliament&#x2019;s consent, and insisting that Charles could not impose martial law on civilians, imprison them without due process, or quarter troops in their homes. This poem survives in twenty-two manuscript copies, though not in print, and in a number of these witnesses the name of the Duke of Buckingham appears in the poem&#x2019;s title. Corbett&#x2019;s most recent editors, J.A.W. Bennett and Hugh Trevor-Roper, take as their copy-text a witness in which it is entitled &#x2018;Verses supposed to be made by Dr Corbet Bp of Oxford against the opposing the Duke in Parliament 1628&#x2019;;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_176"><sup>176</sup></xref> my recensional study of the manuscript witnesses, however, suggests that the titles of the earliest surviving copies, or at least those closest to the archetype, refer only to the Lower House of Parliament, not to Buckingham. It is often these more accidental and paratextual aspects of the text &#x2013; their titles, attributions, marginalia &#x2013; that change and disappear in these manuscript versions, often (as in this case) inflecting the meaning of the text itself. A full collation of all of
<target target-type="page" id="page_152"/>the manuscript witnesses, and a proper recensional study of their relation to one another &#x2013; work that would have been extraordinarily difficult for mid-twentieth-century editors, but which tools such as the <italic>Catalogue of English Literary Manuscripts</italic> now make possible &#x2013; can show us something about the early history of a poem like this, as well as its afterlives.</p>
<p>Alongside this poem in many of the manuscripts, scribes copy an answer poem responding to it satirically line by line,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_177"><sup>177</sup></xref> and on two occasions (BL Additional MS 22959, the diary of John Rous, Suffolk clergyman and brother of Francis Rous MP; and BL Harley MS 6383, kept by John Holles, Second Earl of Clare, and MP for East Retford), it is transcribed alongside other dated items of news from Parliament. Used in conjunction with the stemmas of the textual witnesses (which in themselves show only the relations between the different manuscripts, not the exact process of transcription), these dates can show us something about the transmission and spread of the poem, both chronologically and geographically. In this case, we can work out that Corbett&#x2019;s poem was already by mid-1629 being transmitted along a number of separate lines, that it was already by that time subject to as much variation as it would ever have, and that it had already undergone a number of scribal changes by that point &#x2013; in other words, that the first six months or so of its life were, perhaps unsurprisingly for such a topical poem, an extraordinarily busy period of transmission.</p>
<p>An edition of Corbett attuned to Marotti&#x2019;s social textuality would almost certainly choose to reproduce both the poem itself and the response to it; but it may also find itself engaging with a further short poem, of more peripheral relevance to Corbett, which often appears in the same manuscript miscellanies as the two formerly mentioned, and on a number of occasions is adjacent to them:
<disp-quote>
<p>A learned Bishop of the Land,
<p>Thinking to make religion stand
<p>In equall poize on euery side;</p>
<p>A mixture of them thus he try&#x2019;d.</p>
<p>An ounce of Protestants hee singles,
<p>And with a dramme of Papists mingles.</p>
<p>A scruple addes of Puritan;</p>
<p>And workes them all in his brayne-pan.</p>
<p>Now when hee lookes that should digest:
<disp-quote>
<p>That scruple troubles all the rest.</p>
<p>Early modern manuscript miscellanies contain scores of rather inconse -quential poems of this kind. As Marotti says, many of them are copied in only one surviving manuscript, while others appear in dozens; many of them have no authorial attribution, and very few of them were ever printed. Where, if at all, does this particular one belong in an edition of Corbett&#x2019;s poetry? It doesn&#x2019;t seem to be written by him or to him, and may very well not originally have been about him: on one occasion, it is identified as an attack on Lancelot Andrewes. Nor (unlike the response to Corbett&#x2019;s Parliament poem) is it
<target target-type="page" id="page_153"/>inseparable from poems by him and about him, and yet it is clearly associated with him and with these poems, if only by the keepers of certain manuscript miscellanies. In spite of its superficial resemblances to Corbett&#x2019;s poem, it has little in common with it; far from trying to navigate a path between Catholics and Puritans, Corbett offers a sarcastic and wounded defence of the episcopacy while lambasting the Puritan opponents of Charles&#x2019;s policy, and this short poem hardly reads as a direct response to him. Nevertheless, it is both attachable to Corbett, and detachable from him.</p>
<p>I have chosen to cite this short poem because, brief little squib though it is, it exemplifies a pair of questions that &#x2013; especially in conjunction &#x2013; are of huge conceptual and practical consideration for the relation of manuscript miscel -lanies to single-author editions. One question, or rather a set of questions, is ontological. The mobility of this short poem reminds us that not only are authorial attributions in manuscript miscellanies rather fluid and questionable; not only are the identities of authors built up by texts that purport to be written to them or about them (as well as by them); but more than this, both of these kinds of identity seem to be at the mercy of the way in which miscellanies transmit poems as loose and changing groups, sometimes explicitly or thematically linked together (Another on the same, as it were, and Another by the same) and sometimes not. So is this poem part of Corbett&#x2019;s identity? Should an edition of his poems attempt to reproduce the groups in which they are transmitted and transcribed?</p>
<p>But these issues draw into the light another set of questions, and a much more pragmatic set at that. Editors (and publishers) may for practical reasons simply need to decide where to stop looking for associations, partly so as not to distract a reader with a bewildering range of associations, but partly for the very simple reason that a printed edition might become too unwieldy to handle and too costly to produce. Page count and budget allowing, where, if anywhere, should these poems go? In the body of the edition? In the notes? In an appendix? In an accompanying web resource? These pragmatic questions clearly refer back more conceptually to the boundaries of the text &#x2013; what constitutes part of the author, and what should be part of the edition? Manuscript miscellanies make the editor (and the reader) of a single-author edition realise how uncertain and porous a given writer&#x2019;s body of work might be; the miscellanies demonstrate how texts by a particular author come to be attached to and detached from texts by other authors. Which raises one final question: to what extent should the practice of an editor follow &#x2013; or attempt to work against &#x2013; the practice of the manuscript miscellanies that he/she is editing from? Single-author editions can draw on manuscript miscellanies not only by finding extra information, but by placing individual authors within networks of other texts: texts about them and texts responding to them, but also texts that have a fluid proximity to them. In doing so, though, and in mapping out the fate of the author in the manuscript miscellany, are they editing a single author at all?</p>

<p>While editing a modern-spelling edition of Shakespeare&#x2019;s poems for the Annotated English Poets series (formerly with Longman; now with Routledge; co-edited with Cathy Shrank) I have benefited enormously from the work of three recent editions in particular: John Roe&#x2019;s (Cambridge, 1992), Colin Burrow&#x2019;s (Oxford, 2002), and the joint work of Katherine Duncan-Jones and H.R. Woudhuysen (Arden, 2007). However, they do not leave much room for a new edition to prove itself, especially when (as in the case of <italic>Venus and Adonis</italic> and <italic>The Rape of Lucrece</italic>) the need for a complete rethink of the textual tradition, or another similarly drastic inter vention, is vanishingly slight. Shakespeare being Shakespeare, there are always things to say that have not been said before, about how to interpret individual words and how to understand key patterns of language. Some of these stay within the bounds of the lexical annotation that is generally thought proper to the editor&#x2019;s task, but some cross the boundary into the realm of interpretation. So the editor of Shakespeare is pressed from two directions: by the need to offer something new, and by the need to remain within the bounds of annotation as it is usually defined.</p>
<p>The word &#x2018;sad&#x2019; appears twenty-one times in <italic>The Rape of Lucrece</italic> (1594), and there are three instances of &#x2018;sadly&#x2019;. In the majority of cases a modern reader needs no help, because &#x2018;sad&#x2019; means unhappy, sorrowful, or causing unhappiness/sorrow, as it does today. In a few other cases it has or evokes another sense (grave, serious) that is familiar to regular readers of Shakespeare, and usually reachable enough for the uninitiated thanks to context. Since that sense is no longer current, an annotator might expect to say something. R.S. White, following David Crystal&#x2019;s adapted use of the term, recognises &#x2018;sad&#x2019; as a &#x2018;false friend&#x2019;. This is partly a lexical issue but, as his essay&#x2019;s bibliography shows, it is also tied into weighty matters in the history of the emotions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_178"><sup>178</sup></xref> It&#x2019;s not just that the feeling of sadness varies across history; the understanding of the nature of feeling does as well. So there is an additional need to curtail and refine a modern reader&#x2019;s set of associations about sadness.</p>
<p>Turning to the <ITALIC>OED</ITALIC> is of course often the editor&#x2019;s first move. The dictionary can produce a suggestive sense that a word is in motion, with its various meanings reconfiguring in the historical moment at issue; but not so much in this case, as both key meanings are available in 1594. The <ITALIC>OED</ITALIC> often gives Shakespeare a prominent role in such entries, but again, in this case, not so (as it happens, Milton comes to the fore). These entries can be more than just corroboration for a reading. An annotator can usefully convey to the edition&#x2019;s readers a lexicographer&#x2019;s belief that a particular usage is symptomatic or innovative.</p>
<target target-type="page" id="page_155"/>
<p>&#x2018;Sad&#x2019; does have an interesting life in English, with its modern use developing from distant origins. The <ITALIC>OED</ITALIC> distinguishes two main strands, I, &#x2018;of persons and immaterial things: satisfied, full; steady, serious&#x2019;, and II, &#x2018;feeling sorrow or regret&#x2019;. There is an important sequence through the definitions under I, from satisfied (Latin <italic>satis</italic>) to sated to weary to settled, steadfast, constant, and then dignified, grave, serious.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_179"><sup>179</sup></xref> There is another under II, from grave to heavy-hearted, sorrowful, mournful; and then the word is transferred onto situations and things that cause distress. Lexical depth is, of course, not only revealed by moving between a text and the <ITALIC>OED</ITALIC>. The <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC>-TCP database, for example, can (in the case of rarer words especially) provide some invaluable orientation. Likewise other works by Shakespeare, possible sources, and/or comparable works from the period. In the case of &#x2018;sad&#x2019;, however, the way the word is used in <italic>The Rape of Lucrece</italic> matters more. Although the word has plenty of other extended senses in the <ITALIC>OED</ITALIC> entry, it is the <italic>sad-sorrowful</italic> and <italic>sad-serious</italic> split that becomes significant, especially towards the end of Shakespeare&#x2019;s poem. Later uses partake of resonances from earlier uses; earlier uses develop and anticipate what comes later.</p>
<p>The male Romans get past <italic>sad-sorrowful</italic>, through <italic>sad-serious</italic>, and into action. Lucrece wants to finish her story so that Collatine &#x2018;may vow in that sad houre of mine&#x2019; (1179). The proximity of the &#x2018;vow&#x2019; makes the sense of seriousness pertinent here. Collatine is horrified, initially &#x2018;sad beholding&#x2019; (here sorrow predominates). When, soon after, he and &#x2018;his consorted Lords&#x2019; apply their &#x2018;sad attention&#x2019; (1609&#x2013;10) to what is called her &#x2018;sad dirge&#x2019; (1612), the quality of their immersion seems grave as well as pitying. However, Collatine&#x2019;s &#x2018;sad set eyes&#x2019; in line 1662 suggest grief more than resolve, and Lucrece ends up breaking into what is called his &#x2018;untimelie frenzie&#x2019; (1675). Although the word &#x2018;sad&#x2019; is not used of him, or around him, Brutus embodies the turn towards <italic>sad-serious</italic> at the end. As Shakespeare notes, in line with his sources, the Romans had classed Brutus with &#x2018;seelie jeering idiots. . . uttring foolish things&#x2019; (1812&#x2013;13) until this moment. In the end he is the one who turns <italic>sad-sorrowful</italic> into <italic>sad-serious</italic>, and the Tarquins are expelled.</p>
<p>Annotation has received less attention than editorial issues such as establishing copy-text or whether to retain original spelling, but its scholars have still produced a conundrum. Those espousing positive principles advocate &#x2018;explanatory matter to bridge the gap between Shakespeare&#x2019;s language and our own&#x2019;,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_180"><sup>180</sup></xref> and, while acknowledging the difficulty of deciding, advise us not to include the unnecessary or to omit the necessary. A compelling warning against excess emphasises &#x2018;clarification of the text&#x2019; as the goal, and thus proscribes unnecessary parallels and cross-references, refutations of other editors, moral reflections, and &#x2018;negative results&#x2019; &#x2013; that is, the editor recording that, despite earnest efforts, a problem remains unsolved.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_181"><sup>181</sup></xref> In relation to lexical matters, the hard-earned fruits of not entirely fruitless labours may not be so superfluous: gaps in the coverage of <ITALIC>OED</ITALIC> and <ITALIC>EEBO</ITALIC>-TCP can help illuminate the energy of a given usage.</p>
<p>I say &#x2018;illuminate&#x2019; as an alternative to &#x2018;clarify&#x2019;, and in doing so gain some inspiration from Leah Marcus, whose discussion of attempts to pin down the implications of calling Sycorax &#x2018;blew ey&#x2019;d&#x2019; opens her book on &#x2018;Unediting&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_182"><sup>182</sup></xref></p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_156"/>I also felt inspired when I first read Stephen Booth weighing in against clarifying commentary, which tends to undervalue what he sees as a crucial and unique quality:
<disp-quote>
<p>Shakespeare&#x2019;s language is exciting to the minds that hear it &#x2013; exciting to minds because what is being said in a Shakespearian sentence often comes to us in a soup of possibilities, possibilities engendered by substantively negligible, substantively irrelevant relationships among elements in a syntax to which those relationships do not pertain and by which those relationships are filtered from consciousness.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_183"><sup>183</sup></xref></p>
<p>This is more than just a counterweight to a parsimonious view of what linguistic annotation should be; it is a programme for Booth&#x2019;s own edition of the <italic>Sonnets</italic>, in which he goes further than most (including myself) would in the expansiveness of his commentary.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_184"><sup>184</sup></xref></p>
<p>Writings by editors on the subject of annotation take as their test cases words likely to be in the <ITALIC>OED</ITALIC> categories &#x2018;rare&#x2019;, &#x2018;obsolete&#x2019;, and &#x2018;archaic&#x2019;,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_185"><sup>185</sup></xref> as well as proper names and other items that require specific cultural comment (like the Cataians in <italic>Twelfth Night</italic> and <italic>The Merry Wives of Windsor</italic> that Billings has puzzled over, or the accumulating burdens faced by the annotator of Hooker, as discussed by Speed-Hill).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_186"><sup>186</sup></xref> While &#x2018;sad&#x2019; has its &#x2018;obsolete&#x2019; strands in the dictionary, the problem here is how to deal with the familiar alongside the unfamiliar; how to respect the fact that most of the time a modern reader encounters little resistance. Should an annotator make difficulty? A positive answer, though still not unproblematic, is surely closer in the case of an oft-edited, familiar text (in comparison with, say, a manuscript appearing in print for the first time).</p>
<p>For example, should the annotator note (and if so, where and how) that <italic>sad-sorrowful</italic> works for the first instance (worrisome news &#x2018;strooke [struck] her sad&#x2019;, 262), but <italic>sad-serious</italic> for the second (&#x2018;sad pause, and deepe regard beseemes the sage&#x2019;, 277) only fifteen lines later, as if we are meant to pick up the range of possibilities in the word? I think so. Should the annotator note (and if so, where and how) that on three occasions the word is altered by association with something it may describe with particular pertinence? Again, I think so. We have to understand what sort of sadness is manifest in a dog (&#x2018;Hee like a theevish dog creeps sadly thence&#x2019;, 736). We also have to work out its contribution to the half-exposed deceitful pose of Sinon (&#x2018;Sinon here is painted, /So sober sad, so wearie, and so milde&#x2019;, 1541). I hyphenated this in our modern-spelling edition, which presents it as a suggestive compound, part of the patient, abject, despondent gravity that wins over Priam and ruins Troy. And then should an annotator make much of the depiction in Lucrece&#x2019;s picture of the Trojans looking out at the Greek army, where we hear that &#x2018;one might see those farre of [far-off] eyes looke sad&#x2019; (1386)? This elaborates the Trojans &#x2018;gazing uppon the Greekes with little lust&#x2019; (1384), which suggests a kind of grim gloom with elements of both <italic>sad-sorrowful</italic> and <italic>sad-serious</italic>. And again, I think it is worth a brief note to this effect.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_157"/>The language of annotation varies. It can be used to characterise the central tension in different ways as the various instances require: &#x2018;(i) sorrowful, (ii) serious&#x2019;; &#x2018;serious, rather than sorrowful, but see l. 262 and n.&#x2019;, &#x2018;with its usual modern sense (sorrowful) here, but its other Elizabethan meaning, serious, may contribute . . .&#x2019;. Annotations of this kind may be worse than nothing, though, in that they may only serve to interrupt or over-organise a reader&#x2019;s ability to handle a polyvalent word.</p>
<p>One tempting form in which to capture the liveliness of words is provided by the lexicography of Shakespeare&#x2019;s own time. John Florio&#x2019;s Italian&#x2013; English dictionary, <italic>Worlde of Wordes</italic> (1598), includes &#x2018;sad&#x2019; in several lists of words addressing diverse Italian concepts.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_187"><sup>187</sup></xref> These clusters are instructive, though they also conjure further difficulties: &#x2018;sad, discontent, grieved, melan -cholie, pensive, heavie, full of discomfiture, sorowfull, wofull, of much gravitie, unpleasant. Also knavish, wilie, craftie, subtle, malicious, deceitfull, slye&#x2019; (<italic>tristo</italic>); &#x2018;of a grave and solemne countenance, of a heavie and sad looke, having a big looke, a sowre man&#x2019; (<italic>voltuoso</italic>); &#x2018;diligent, speedy, carefull, hastie, warie, watchfull, sollicitous, pensive, sad, that never resteth, timorous and fearefull, full of carke and care, busie, much occupied&#x2019; (<italic>sol&#x00E9;cito</italic>); &#x2018;a sad, busie, frowning, garboiling fellow, a swash buckler&#x2019; (<italic>imbroglione</italic>); &#x2018;tasteless, unwill ing, sad, pensive, unlustie, crazed, had ones will&#x2019; (<italic>suogliato</italic>); and more. In Randle Cotgrave&#x2019;s French <italic>Dictionarie</italic> (1611) there is a similar range, from the coherent and familiar, to the quite unexpected.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_188"><sup>188</sup></xref> I like &#x2018;reposed, rested; lyen fallow a greatwhile; also, sad, setled, stayed, quiet, grave, discreet&#x2019; (<italic>repos&#x00E9;</italic>). These lists show a word in action, as one language&#x2019;s vocabulary is mustered and arrayed in response to another.</p>
<p>Word lists are a rhetorical resource allowed to the modern annotator only in moderation, and the idea would be focusing triangulation, rather than instructive dispersal. The excitement of language is something that the annotator needs to enable, but not test to the point of exhaustion. In the case of &#x2018;sad&#x2019;, it&#x2019;s worth doing, so it&#x2019;s worth doing properly. I opted to write a longer gloss, gathering the poem&#x2019;s &#x2018;sad&#x2019; network into one place (the first instance in the poem that contributed to it significantly) and asserting a pattern greater than the sum of its parts. That went along with cross-references from the other instances. There is still the possibility that a reader who faces no difficulty with a word that means at that point in the poem, more or less plainly and simply, what it means today, might then be detained by a long disquisition that goes beyond &#x2018;clarification&#x2019; and perhaps beyond &#x2018;illumination&#x2019;. However, the text needs and merits this sort of attention, and it is a form in which an editor can offer new things to its readers, many of whom will own more than one version of a Shakespeare work.</p>
<p>Booth maintains that Shakespeare poses unique challenges, but in relation to the practical questions I am considering here, I think there is a difference in degree rather than kind. &#x2018;Clarification&#x2019; is always a useful concept, as it prioritises an act of enabling: with the right annotation a reader can think independently through the text. However, putting &#x2018;serious&#x2019; in a few cases, or nothing at all by most of the instances of &#x2018;sad&#x2019; in <italic>The Rape of Lucrece</italic> (and
<target target-type="page" id="page_158"/>there are many equivalents of this in many other writers), offers the reader an over-simplified experience of the ramifications of words. Greater elaboration opens up the poem&#x2019;s language to the reader, and it also (I hope) gets across that it is still alive and kicking in the editor&#x2019;s hands, and theirs too.</p>

<title>3.1.1 Parting &#x2018;with much wee know&#x2019;:</title>
<p><bold>digital editing and the early modern text</bold></p>
<p><italic>Andrew Zurcher</italic></p>
<p>Would Truth dispense, we could be content, with Plato, that knowledge were but Remembrance; that Intellectual acquisition were but Remin -iscentiall evocation, and new impressions but the colourishing of old stamps which stood pale in the soul before.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_1"><sup>1</sup></xref></p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne&#x2019;s famous rubbishing (not rubrishing) of Plato&#x2019;s account of knowledge turns on the textual processes that defined learning in his own day. The &#x2018;new impressions&#x2019; to which philosophers were exposed were not simply the <italic>impressiones</italic> of the Athenian epistemological tradition, but the &#x2018;stamps&#x2019; too of that early modern European engine of study and the advancement of learning, the printing press. New ideas are bought at the expense of the old, and for Browne one book drives out another: &#x2018;for . . . knowledge is made by oblivion; and to purchase a clear and warrantable body of Truth, we must forget and part with much wee know&#x2019; (<italic>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</italic>, sig a3r). The connection which Browne implies between new knowledge and its new material &#x2018;bodies&#x2019; (editions, harmonies, concordances, encyclopaedias, etc.) has long been conventional, even inevitable. It describes a material structure of scholarly progress characteristic not only of scientific discovery, but (as for Browne in the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic>) of the curation, the editing, of older texts. But that dynamic is changing. Until recently, scholarship advanced by the obliviation of its ephemerised texts; until recently, new editions cut their teeth on the carcasses of their predecessors. Today, as our publishing practices have begun to shift out of paper toward electronic processes of transcription, collation, correction, composition, and dissemina -tion, we face a future in which scholarly editions may never be superseded. Instead, they may simply go on migrating, evolving, and accommodating more functionality. Instead, truth <italic>will</italic> dispense, and the &#x2018;new&#x2019; editions of the future will present, to borrow Browne&#x2019;s metaphor, the &#x2018;colourishing&#x2019; of those paler pieces of earlier editions.</p>
<p>Browne&#x2019;s example suggests a number of reasons for pausing on the threshold of a brave new digital world. The first of these concerns the social structures
<target target-type="page" id="page_172"/>from which scholarly editions have traditionally emerged. Like these editions, Browne&#x2019;s project issued in a set of authorial achievements and goods, including status, a place in the history of intellectual and literary transmission. As W. Speed Hill has noted, the scholar&#x2019;s need to constitute a public and professional identity has driven editorial projects over the last century.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_2"><sup>2</sup></xref> These projects often lead to later interpretative and other study, but, as Speed Hill argues, the progress of textual scholarship itself gener ally proves inconsequential, even irrelevant to the wider reception of earlier writers. Editing thus seems to have prospered as an academic practice because it has proven &#x2018;congenial&#x2019; (35) to academic pretensions of authority and status. By contrast, pioneers and theorists of online editorial practice now stress new social and professional structures and methods available to editors: not only widely distributed collaborative workflow models, which draw together specialists from a range of scholarly and technical back grounds, but crowdsourcing (cf. 3.3.1 and 3.3.2). Peter Robinson has argued that &#x2018;the digital world is changing the way we work with each other, and it is changing who &#x201C;we&#x201D; are&#x2019;;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_3"><sup>3</sup></xref> however, the social dynamics of these methods grate against existing professional structures (hierarchy, promotion, publication record, funding models, etc.) that depend on the conventional associations between editorial &#x2018;authorship&#x2019; and authority. Browne&#x2019;s example does not just point at the fault line between the traditional editorial curation of early modern texts and the online, archive-ready environment. It also shows what is really at stake in this rupture: the social conventions that structure academic authority and identity.</p>
<p>Collaborative editorial working practices are not the only challenge to confront these structures. In a densely speculative essay, Hans Walter Gabler has argued that scholarly editions born digital will be liberated from the tyranny of the material origins of the authorial text, and from the concomitant supposal that it is the editor&#x2019;s commission to replicate that text as faithfully as possible. Instead, once we have recognised that &#x2018;the edition text in a scholarly edition is . . . always distinctly other than any one contingently historical manifestation of the text or work it represents . . . always the editor&#x2019;s text&#x2019;,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_4"><sup>4</sup></xref> we will see that in the digital space, by contrast, &#x2018;the editor, and the edition of the editor&#x2019;s responsibility, will no longer decree a text&#x2019; (47). For Gabler, the electronic edition &#x2018;will be constituted&#x2019; as a &#x2018;hub of criticism and knowledge&#x2019; in a relational architecture that reflects &#x2018;the given texts, works, and writers, their everyday, and the thought and world-view of their times&#x2019; (54). As the use of terms such as &#x2018;decree&#x2019; and &#x2018;constitute&#x2019; might suggest, this vision of editing has strong ideological affiliations. Absent a &#x2018;decreed text&#x2019; at the centre of a new edition, there is no anchor for the authority of the editor, a place to plant the flag that might capture further funding, secure a promotion, establish a reputation or legacy. Put simply, the digital utopia of online hubs and the evolving intertext is itself at odds with the individualistic, consumerist ideology typical of Western capitalist society and its institutions; this is surely part of the reason why Oxford University Press&#x2019;s own foray into online editions, the <italic>Oxford Scholarly Editions Online</italic> project (<uri>www.oxfordscholarlyeditions.com), retains the print volume (and its editorial structure) at the centre of its online architecture, not only for &#x2018;heritage&#x2019; editions but for new content. And &#x2013; which
<target target-type="page" id="page_173"/>is perhaps more significant &#x2013; it does so behind a paywall. If we are ever to achieve what Robinson calls &#x2018;editing without walls&#x2019;, we will need to reform completely the complex tangle of funding, governance, professional hierarchy, and related social and intellectual structures that have to date both sponsored and constrained our working patterns.</p>
<p>The sociality of texts, then, may require an entirely new sociology of editorial curation. But beyond the problems presented by our own working practices, the texts to be edited may contain their own intrinsic resistances &#x2013; resistances, in particular, to the totalising textual and editorial ambitions of the digital scholar. Gabler&#x2019;s relational vision fulfils the promise of D.F. McKenzie&#x2019;s &#x2018;sociology of texts&#x2019;, and builds explicitly on the work of Jerome McGann, whose own Rossetti Archive blazed the trail for experimentation in online literary archival hubs. McGann sees these hubs as fundamentally multiple, &#x2018;editorial machines capable of generating on demand multiple textual forma -tions &#x2013; eclectic, facsimile, reading, genetic &#x2013; that can all be subjected to multiple kinds of transformational analyses&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_5"><sup>5</sup></xref> Thus, not only will the online archive be copiously connected to other texts &#x2013; commentary, sources, analogues, contexts of various kinds &#x2013; but the text itself will remain fundamentally abundant: not one text, but itself a capacity for generating any conceivable desired inflection of the text (e.g. modernisation, standardisation, eclecticism, etc.). McGann&#x2019;s ambitious &#x2018;editorial machines&#x2019; transcend the limitations of particular historical texts and text-instances, recognising that literary works are not (as McGann says) &#x2018;one <italic>thing</italic>&#x2019; but &#x2018;many <italic>things</italic>&#x2019;,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_6"><sup>6</sup></xref> that (writes Gabler) &#x2018;synchronous and diachronous struc tures combine to form the literary work in the totality of its real presence in the documents of its conception, transmission, and publication&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_7"><sup>7</sup></xref> Pleni-texts &#x2013; that is, richly linked &#x2018;editorial machines&#x2019; that give an account of this &#x2018;totality&#x2019; of the real presence of a text &#x2013; thus seek not to extend but to end the textual tradition of a given work, and therefore deserve to be called, in this sense, eschatographies. In a similar way, the rich tissue of commentary, annotation, cross-reference, and external linking in which online editions can be be swaddled not only fulfils the various meanings of the works they contain, but at length may exhaust those meanings.</p>
<p>Literary history, however, throws up many examples of texts that resist the idealising perfection which Gabler and McGann champion. In fact, with its manuscript coteries, its penchant for plagiarism, imitatio, and collabora tive authorship, its sharply political and often satirical drama and poetry, the early modern period is full of this kind of text. Thomas Nashe&#x2019;s picaresque prose narrative <italic>The Vnfortunate Traueller</italic> (1594) opens with an &#x2018;Induction&#x2019; in which Nashe forecasts the use to which his paper book can be put after reading &#x2013; &#x2018;priuie&#x2019; or toilet paper, paper for drying and kindling tobacco, paper to wrap pantofles in, paper to stop mustard pots.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_8"><sup>8</sup></xref> For Nashe, as for many satirists, it is essential to the experience of reading satire that it be consumed in so material, and therefore ephemeral, a form. The reader is to remember at every stage of engaging with and construing the text that it will eventually go to ministering to the body&#x2019;s needs &#x2013; as indeed the proceeds of the book&#x2019;s sale went to feeding Nashe. A similar sort of insistence on limitation characterises those texts from the period whose histories are encrusted with variants acquired from
<target target-type="page" id="page_174"/>manuscript revision and transmission. Erotic lyric verse, like many a theatrical script, exists in multiple equally compelling, often equally textually legitimate variant states that might be faithfully represented not only by an <italic>apparatus criticus</italic>, but also by an online and betoggled text. But many of these poems circulated in manuscript both before and after print publication, and retain inscribed in their conceits and structure the indelible marks of their material form; more, they operate by provoking and frustrating a desire for that perfect text. Edmund Spenser&#x2019;s <italic>Amoretti</italic> (1595) begins with a sonnet that imagines his beloved as she &#x2018;handle[s]&#x2019; the &#x2018;trembling&#x2019; &#x2018;leaues&#x2019; of his book of poems, and concludes: &#x2018;Leaues, lines, and rymes, seeke her to please alone, | whom if ye please, I care for other none.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_9"><sup>9</sup></xref> Sonnets from Samuel Daniel&#x2019;s <italic>Delia</italic> (1592) first appeared in 1591, at the back of a pirated and garbled text of Sir Philip Sidney&#x2019;s <italic>Astrophil and Stella</italic> &#x2013; the kind of text editors summarily deprecate when establishing copy for an edition of Sidney&#x2019;s poems. Like Spenser, in the first of these sonnets Daniel imagines readers encountering his poems, and particularly welcomes those who &#x2018;like to mee doo fare&#x2019; &#x2013; that is, those readers who are bound by a hopeless love. In the second quatrain, he makes a textual joke that invokes the history of manuscript variants from which his poems have been printed, and defies the editorial perfection of his text:
<disp-quote>
<p>But vntoucht hearts with vnaffected eye, Approach not to behold my soules distresse, Cleere sighted you will note what is awry, Whilst blind ones see no error in my verse.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_10"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
<p>The bad rhyme on &#x2018;distresse&#x2019; and &#x2018;verse&#x2019; between lines six and eight seems to reflect either the poet&#x2019;s overwrought incompetence or a transmission error; clear-sighted readers, Daniel imagines, will recognise this sort of inconsistency and immediately &#x2018;note&#x2019; it &#x2013; that is, take notice of it, but also make a note (e.g. in the margin) about it, or even publicly advertise it to others. The poem flaunts its textual instability, its imperfection, as a challenge to editing readers; to remain &#x2018;blind&#x2019;, to see the poem&#x2019;s textual limitation as its strength, is to share in its passion. Little wonder that in the authorised printing of 1592, the castigated line 8 reads: &#x2018;Whilst blinded ones mine errours neuer gesse&#x2019;. Spenser&#x2019;s leaves and Daniel&#x2019;s bad rhymes ask uncomfortable questions about the virtues of the digital edition.</p>
<p>Spenser&#x2019;s <italic>The Shepheardes Calender</italic> (1579) goes further than Nashe&#x2019;s self-deconstructing texts, and the erotic privacy of the <italic>Amoretti and Delia</italic>. Spenser seems to have worked closely with his printer to produce a text deliberately defective in varied ways. For example, at its first printing, Spenser&#x2019;s collection of eclogues featured for every speaker an &#x2018;emblem&#x2019; or pithy epigraphic <italic>sententia</italic> at the conclusion of each poem. This emblem serves as a kind of ethopoeic caricature of the speaker or speakers of the eclogue, and suggests both an interpretative framework for understanding the associated poem, and a set of challenges to that framework. At the end of the &#x2018;December&#x2019; eclogue, Colin Clout&#x2019;s paratextual emblem is signalled by an introductory title, but does not appear; instead there is only a blank.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_11"><sup>11</sup></xref> In the commentary attached to the poem
<target target-type="page" id="page_175"/>by Spenser&#x2019;s first (perhaps fictional) editor E.K., we find by oblique reference and discussion that the emblem must have said something about the permanence of Spenser&#x2019;s poetic composition. To make the point, E.K. cites both Horace and Ovid, whose verses from the <italic>Odes</italic> and the <italic>Metamorphoses</italic>, respectively, offer sources for Spenser&#x2019;s missing imitation; but, naturally, E.K. misquotes both of these examples. The &#x2018;December&#x2019; eclogue thus poses a complex editorial problem: how to negotiate the presentation of the deliberately ruptured text, without correcting it, displacing it, buttressing it with explanatory or compensatory commentary, or apologising for it &#x2013; all of them edi torial actions that, as versions of supply in various degree, would undermine the lack of meaning at the centre of the poem&#x2019;s untext. It is crucial to note that this set of problems, rooted in the material experience of reading, misreading, and misconstruing bad texts, arises in the midst of considerations about the nature of the tale or the poem in time. Spenser&#x2019;s textually elaborated eclogue seems to reach after diachronicity even as it resists it; the result is to confound invited further attempts to edit the poem. This is a text that probably <italic>should</italic> remain frustrating.</p>
<p>Spenser frequently engages in this form of textual play. In his epic poem <italic>The Faerie Queene</italic> the gaps and textual instabilities &#x2013; blanks, half-lines, variants between editions, shifting paratexts, etc. &#x2013; often seem keyed to the work&#x2019;s hermeneutic potentials. When Spenser gives up his attempt to describe Dame Nature in the second of the <italic>Two Cantos of Mutabilitie</italic>, he refers the reader to Alain de Lille, with the words, &#x2018;Which who will read set forth so as it ought, | Go seek he out that <italic>Alane</italic> where he may be sought.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_12"><sup>12</sup></xref> The deliberate frustrating of the reader&#x2019;s attempt to see and understand the scene being described is buttressed here by the textual frustration of a pointedly unsociable text. You will have to put this book down, and &#x2018;go&#x2019; somewhere, says Spenser, if you want to know about the thing he is describing &#x2013; even then, you may not find it. An editor who creates of the <italic>Cantos</italic> a relational editorial architecture, a richly linked network of texts and contexts, fails the text&#x2019;s own inherent failure, and frustrates its designed frustration. Satire in Nashe&#x2019;s hands insists on its material ephemerality; allegory in Spenser&#x2019;s stands to lose its heart, if editors insist on rupturing its empty, alienated isolation from the texts on which it draws &#x2013; philosophy, theology, natural science, mythology, literature, and so on. As we learned from Sir Thomas Browne, knowledge is made by oblivion; as it turns out, the digital machine, or relational site, or pleni-text, or what you will, does not just sum and perfect the &#x2018;totality of [the] real presence&#x2019; of a text &#x2013; it replaces it. Digital editing will advance, and we may find not only the technical, but the social, financial, and political structures to support a radical reform of our editorial culture; but even as we toggle, relate, and network the next generation of scholarly editions, we should give some thought to the pleasures and powers of imperfection.</p>

<p>The choices an editor makes when first undertaking a digital edition of a printed book &#x2013; choices of technology, choices of metadata, choices of creating, coding and preserving data, not to mention the more traditional skills of the scholar &#x2013; are often hard enough when the editor is concerned solely with representing the printed word on the page. However, in the digital medium, very often the ends of transcription become tied to considerations of technology.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_13"><sup>13</sup></xref> How will these transcriptions be presented to the end-user of a website? How will those users be able to search within the website in order to navigate collections of digital images? A further level of challenge arises when the principal concern of the edition under con struction is not the printed content of the book, but rather the manuscript interventions made within and against the text by an early modern reader. The book has become a hybrid object: it is both printed text and manuscript.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_14"><sup>14</sup></xref> Here we will describe the practical work that underpins one particular way to approach these choices within the context of a research project that at the time of writing is ten months old. The work is in progress and thus subject to revision, but it is precisely this state of flux, this need to balance a premeditated schema against the demands of problems as they are encountered in the course of research, that provides the intellectual and editorial challenge.</p>

<title>The &#x2018;Archaeology of Reading&#x2019;</title>
<p>The project in question is the &#x2018;Archaeology of Reading&#x2019;, a collaborative research project currently being undertaken by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, Princeton University, and the Centre for Editing Lives and Letters (CELL) at University College London and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_15"><sup>15</sup></xref> In the first phase of the project, the corpus of annotated books we are examining comes exclusively from the library of Gabriel Harvey, the Elizabethan man of parts, professional reader, friend of Spenser and Sidney, and victim of Thomas Nashe.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_16"><sup>16</sup></xref> These books are of consider able interest to us because they were annotated by Harvey. The books are currently dispersed in collections at Princeton University Library, UCL special collections, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Newberry Library, and the Houghton Library at Harvard. The books from Princeton include: <italic>Livy&#x2019;s history of Rome</italic>, Machiavelli&#x2019;s <italic>Art of War</italic>, Freigius&#x2019;s <italic>Paratitla</italic>, Olaus Magnus&#x2019;s history of the Scandinavian north, Philip Melancthon&#x2019;s <italic>Selectarum declamationum</italic>, Sir Thomas Smith&#x2019;s <italic>De recta et emendata linguae Anglicae</italic>, and two books by George Buchanan on Mary Queen of Scots, <italic>De Maria Scotorum Regina</italic> and <italic>Ane detection of the doings of Mary Queen of Scots</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_17"><sup>17</sup></xref> From the Folger we have
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_177"/>Domenichi&#x2019;s <italic>Facetie</italic> and Guicciardini&#x2019;s <italic>Detti et Fatti</italic>;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_18"><sup>18</sup></xref> from the Houghton, <italic>Frontinus&#x2019;s Stratagems</italic>;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_19"><sup>19</sup></xref> and from UCL and the Newberry, two versions of Castiglione&#x2019;s <italic>Courtier</italic>, the UCL copy in the original Italian, the Newberry in the English of Thomas Hoby.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_20"><sup>20</sup></xref> While the initial focus is on Harvey&#x2019;s library, the primary scholarly aim of the project is to allow scholars to move beyond studies of individual readers with individual books &#x2013; from how Harvey read his Livy, how x read his or her y &#x2013; to a wider, more comparative history of reading based upon the analysis of data. To that end, we are developing a second phase, projected to run 2016&#x2013;2018, that uses John Dee as a point of comparison.</p>
<p>This is not because that is the only or even the best way to do histories of reading, but because such comparative work has not really been possible before. Previously, scholars have been limited by the logistical constraints of time, geography, and finance, as they sought a detailed overview of col lections of annotated books dispersed among libraries across Europe and North America.</p>
<p>The opportunity afforded by the emerging ubiquity of something scholars tend to refer to as &#x2018;the digital humanities&#x2019; allows research projects to inte grate tools that standardise archival and retrieval of digital source material and data.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_21"><sup>21</sup></xref> In particular, the infrastructure that is being developed across myriad projects funded by the Mellon Foundation is making available tools that standardise how readers can view high-resolution digitised images within a webpage, and other tools that standardise how those images can be searched, compared, and otherwise manipulated in the course of scholarship.</p>
<p>The project is &#x2018;an archaeology&#x2019; of reading because we are seeking to excavate the contours of a number of early modern intellectual and political debates through the physical interventions readers made in their books. We can discern, for example, manoeuvres in his reading practice that take us across seemingly unrelated material: Harvey&#x2019;s notes on the life of Mary, Queen of Scots, are grounded in the succession debates of the 1590s and directly linked to early &#x2018;contract theory&#x2019; authors. We are interested not only in the concepts and ideas debated in print, but crucially in how engaged readers understood those concepts and ideas within a specific historical context. Furthermore, we can attempt to reconstitute reading lists and book collections by examining the links between texts, often texts that have disappeared from the commonly held canon of the history of ideas. For example, Harvey&#x2019;s comments on the civil law and jurisprudence recommend authors and titles now obscure even within the specialist historiography of the subject.</p>
<p>This project is a corporate enterprise, comprising half a dozen scholars in locations across the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy, so it has been necessary to create a schema and an infrastructure that supports corporate transcription. Transcriptions, which are formatted using a computer-readable mark-up language, are carried out according to policies laid out in a &#x2018;Tran -scriber&#x2019;s Manual&#x2019;, which is stored online and regularly updated; questions of approach are discussed and decided upon using a private email list; and the .XML files containing the transcriptions are uploaded to a central GitHub repository for purposes of version control where they can be checked by a team member other than the original transcriber. The research team&#x2019;s first important
<target target-type="page" id="page_178"/>decision, after the straight forward choice to employ Extensible Markup Language (XML) to encode the transcriptions, was not to make use of the most common pre-existing XML standard for creating digital texts, the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_22"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
<p>The pre-eminent position of TEI within the world of digital texts means that when a decision is made not to employ TEI, that decision needs to be explained and justified. TEI has enabled great things to be done in the name of scholarship: careers have been dedicated to its development as a standard and to its employment in the generation of digital texts. It is well established, having been in development since the late 1980s. It is itself an XML schema, having been converted to that language from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), the unwieldy progenitor of mark-up languages, over the course of the 2000s. It has widespread support within the academic com munity. However, it is not universally suitable.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_23"><sup>23</sup></xref> Neither, given the inherently flexible nature of XML as a technology, is it necessary to confine oneself to a single standard, to force TEI to fit the project, so long as the new alternative is well formed and well documented and end-users can understand what is being marked up and why. In such circumstances it is trivial, in the programming sense of that word at least, to convert data from one schema to another.</p>
<p>We decided not to use TEI for three main reasons. First, because this project focuses on the hybrid nature of annotated books. After all, TEI exists primarily to create digital editions of texts. Instead of marking up the entire content of a book, the Archaeology of Reading is primarily interested in capturing the <italic>relationship</italic> between content and reader as far as that rela tionship is recover -able from the traces of a reading that exist in annotation. The straight forward content of the book is &#x2013; to this project &#x2013; of secondary conceptual importance. Second, TEI would not be helpful to this project because it leaves the capturing of marginalia ambiguous within the schema. With TEI, common practice is to use a &#x003C;note&#x003E; element to transcribe the comment and to fix its place in the margin. However, this element is extremely limited: useful for capturing the content of the note, but not the complex data that the Archaeology of Reading team requires. Thirdly, while TEI is extremely powerful, it has become corres -pondingly complex: the complete guidelines run to just over 1,700 pages in a 18.8 MB PDF file. We felt that a purpose-built, flexible, and simpler schema would be more intuitive for our transcribers &#x2013; a small team of academic researchers with higher degrees in early modern studies, coordinated by a post -doctoral researcher &#x2013; to learn. We could not take for granted we would be able to employ researchers conversant with TEI.</p>
<p>Thus the Archaeology of Reading project has designed and employs a custom schema with the specific purpose of describing and encoding anno -tations on the printed page. While it is not intended that we see this as a &#x2018;standard&#x2019; as such &#x2013; something to be adopted by a wider community of scholars as a necessity of research &#x2013; we do envision that scholars working on similar projects could also employ our schema, or at least use the schema as a starting point for modification to render it suitable for their own research needs. It is therefore a schema that shies away from imposing our own editorial judge ments as far as possible &#x2013; we do not, for instance, mark up marginal notes according
<target target-type="page" id="page_179"/>to a list of subjects, preferring to leave that sort of interpretive work to those who will eventually be able to both view page and transcription alongside one another on a website.</p>
<p>Our starting point was the idea of a &#x2018;modular&#x2019; approach, by which the common methods of annotating books in the early modern period &#x2013; a reasonably stable, widespread, and consistent set of standards in themselves &#x2013; could form a core schema. Around this schema, the individual practices of named individuals (Harvey of course, but also others such as John Dee and Isaac Casaubon) could be integrated. This proved to be a false step: there is actually very little variation between readers in terms of the methods they use to annotate.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_24"><sup>24</sup></xref> Instead we have concentrated on using Harvey&#x2019;s practice as an annotator as an exemplar: we are confident that an XML schema that can deal with Harvey can deal with other annotators. That is to say, following a wide survey of early modern annotation practice, we have not found either (i) a system of annotation used by another early modern reader that Harvey does not use himself, or (ii) a system so radically different that it cannot be easily accommodated within the wider structure of the schema. Our selection of books has allowed us to create an XML schema that can cope with cap turing Harvey&#x2019;s methods of working with the text and can be updated in an elegant and logical manner where necessary &#x2013; when encountering new types of marking, for instance. The schema outlined below was developed over a course of three months in a collaborative process between the scholarly team at CELL &#x2013; who had primary responsibility for its development &#x2013; and the technical team of software engineers based at Johns Hopkins&#x2019; Digital Research and Curation Center (DRCC). This process is genuinely interdisciplinary: decisions we make about what is of importance to scholars condition the DRCC&#x2019;s design brief. At the same time our schema has to be ordered in such a way as to be amenable to the software they are working with: the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_25"><sup>25</sup></xref> IIIF is, like XML, another open web standard, but in this case for working with image resources. It is supported by leading research libraries, museums, and other similar institutions as the best way to share and make available on the web materials such as illuminated manuscripts, art, books, newspapers, and other archival materials.</p>

<title>The XML schema</title>
<p>In order for a computer to be able to do anything with any XML tran scription, that transcription first has to be &#x2018;well-formed&#x2019; and &#x2018;valid&#x2019;. To be well-formed, it must conform to the strict syntax of XML outlined in the standard published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the body responsible for governing all technological standards in use on the web. Furthermore, to be considered valid the XML transcription must obey not only the generic syntax of all XML, but must also conform to the particular set of rules that are established within a schema in order to describe an object. For example, an XML schema for describing a car might specify that an element called &#x003C;engine&#x003E; is required: any description using this schema would be invalid if it did not include an &#x003C;engine&#x003E; tag. A &#x003C;transmission&#x003E; tag might be limited to two
<target target-type="page" id="page_180"/>responses, automatic or manual, any other value being invalid. Other tags could be left optional, to be used as circumstances dictate. The choices we make when defining a schema are thus of primary importance and extend to not only what we choose to capture, but in what order.</p>
<p>Every XML schema has one single root element, which comprises all other elements of the data. For example, online XML tutorials might use the root element &#x003C;car&#x003E; to build a schema to describe all cars or &#x003C;book&#x003E; to describe all books, but the choice of term is essentially arbitrary and does not have to be a generic term for the thing being described. The Archaeology of Reading schema is built around &#x003C;transcription&#x003E;, a choice made to remind ourselves that the documents we are producing are indeed transcriptions and subject to the same considerations as any other transcription of early modern material. The metadata, or data describing data, contained within &#x003C;transcription&#x003E; are deliberately minimal. Again, this is a consequence of our XML files being transcriptions of reader&#x2019;s activities within books rather than the books them selves. (More extensive metadata about the books as objects is stored separately within a relational database, which will also be open to end-users. This is because another aspect of the project is to improve the cataloguing practices associated with annotated books.) The purpose of the metadata associated with &#x003C;transcription&#x003E; - using as attributes filename, pagination, and signature - is to help tie the .XML file containing the transcription to the image of the printed page as represented by a high-resolution .tiff image sitting elsewhere in the server stack.</p>
<p>Within the &#x003C;transcription&#x003E; root element sits a child element called &#x003C;annotation&#x003E;, which acts simply as a container to hold all forms of a reader&#x2019;s intervention with the material condition of the page, subdivided into seven other elements. The seven elements used to capture interventions are: &#x003C;marginalia&#x003E;, &#x003C;underline&#x003E;, &#x003C;symbol&#x003E;, &#x003C;mark&#x003E;, &#x003C;numeral&#x003E;, &#x003C;errata&#x003E;, and &#x003C;drawing&#x003E;. (In keep ing with our desire to produce a flexible, modular schema, other elements could be added to the schema.) While &#x003C;numeral&#x003E; and &#x003C;errata&#x003E; are relatively minor elements - used for, respectively, instances where the reader has marked up sequential sections of an argument (e.g. &#x2018;1, 2, 3&#x2019;, &#x2018;&#x03B1;, <bold>&#x03B2;</bold>, <italic>y&#x2019;)</italic> and where the reader has &#x2018;corrected&#x2019; the text - the other elements make up the greater part of the transcriber&#x2019;s business.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>&#x003C;marginalia&#x003E;</title>
<p>The &#x003C;marginalia&#x003E; element captures not only a transcription of the text of a marginal note, but also important material and contextual information about that note: the type of hand in which the note was written, a date (if known), the identity of the reader, the language in which the note is written, and the position and alignment of the marginalia on the printed page. The &#x003C;marginalia&#x003E; element can also, where warranted, contain a translation of the text. It is important to note that our schema is language-neutral and does not make assumptions either about the language in which the note is written or the language into which it is to be translated, a consideration based not only on the polyglot nature of early modern intellectual culture but also our desire
<target target-type="page" id="page_181"/>for the schema to be generic. Where the comment is clearly referring to the printed text, it is possible to add that piece of text using an attribute called &#x2018;anchor_text&#x2019;.</p>
<p>It is also here, within &#x003C;marginalia&#x003E;, that the transcriber can tag instances of people, places, and books mentioned (including cross-references). Tagging allows us to create normalised reference lists amenable to browsing and searching. This is one of the key stages in our transcription process, and is central to the project of using annotations within books to recreate the bibliographic contexts of early modern intellectual debates.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand that marginal notes can move one through the text in routes other than beginning to end, that &#x2018;supra&#x2019; and &#x2018;infra&#x2019;, for example, can take a reader from a comment on one page to one on another by following the trail left behind by Harvey. But marginalia do not always exist within nicely defined pockets of white space alongside the text. Annotation can move within the text, in the white space within paragraphs, even in the white space between words in a sentence. And of course, it can cross the boundaries of the single page, all the way across either the top or gutter of an opening. In the case where two texts have been bound together, it is therefore possible for a marginal comment to begin on the last page of one &#x2018;book&#x2019; and end on the first page of another. Thus our XML schema has to allow for linking within and across collections of books, in a way that can be revealing of &#x2018;networks&#x2019; of books for topics of interest to the reader.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>&#x003C;symbol&#x003E;</title>
<p>Gabriel Harvey, like many early modern commentators, also employed a system of symbolic notation. For example, sections of text dealing with war and warfare are often marked with the astrological symbol for Mars, <italic><bold>&#x2642;</bold></italic>. The &#x003C;symbol&#x003E; element allows the transcriber to record the presence of all these symbols on the page, again including information about their position in relation to the printed text. As with &#x003C;marginalia&#x003E;, if the transcriber is confident that the symbol is tied to a specific section of printed text or marginal annotation, that text can be transcribed so that it is linked directly to the symbol.</p>
<p>Of course, what a symbol represents for one individual reader can be different for another. For this reason, we do not impose a meaning on any given symbol within the mark-up, preferring instead to allow end-users of the website to make such interpretive moves for themselves. While most symbols are taken from fields well-known to Harvey and his educated contemporaries, such as alchemy, or are well attested within annotation practices (the manicule, for instance) there is also the problem of unusual signs which we have been unable to identify or define. Such signs are clearly meaningful to Harvey, and are repeated across texts, but they are unique to him and he provides no key to explain their meaning despite being present in books we know he shared with others. In these cases, we are forced to improvise descriptors in the hope that, by transcribing them consistently across texts, others may be able to recognise or deduce a meaning for them.</p>
<target target-type="page" id="page_182"/>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>&#x003C;underline&#x003E; and &#x003C;mark&#x003E;</title>
<p>Even once verbal and symbolic marginalia are accounted for, there remains a significant amount of work to be done. Capturing the underlining and other marks &#x2013; quotation marks, brackets, hash signs, asterisks, pen trials, etc. &#x2013; is also an important part of the transcription process. It is easy to imagine that underlining, or placing quotation marks alongside a passage, or &#x2018;boxing out&#x2019; a paragraph in ink or red chalk, are traces of engagement with a text, whether as an <italic>aide-memoire</italic>, or to mark out selections to be copied into a commonplace book, or even as a lasting mark of the reader&#x2019;s progress through the book. All underlined text is recorded and individually identified; simply noting that underlining is present on the page would be inadequate to our purpose. This process can be laborious. The value of collecting these data &#x2013; of being able to include in searches not only words that the reader has added to the page, but also words that the reader has non-verbally highlighted &#x2013; justifies the expense of time.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>&#x003C;drawing&#x003E;</title>
<p>Visual marginalia &#x2013; the drawing of pictures, of maps, of diagrams, doodling even &#x2013; is often as common in early modern books as the verbal annotation we consider under &#x003C;marginalia&#x003E;. However, this is one area of the schema that needs to be more fully developed. One drawback of starting the project with Harvey&#x2019;s library and building outwards is that Harvey&#x2019;s annotations are not very visual. To be exact, there is just one piece of visual marginalia in the initial corpus, a cartoon of a man in profile in the Newberry copy of Castiglione&#x2019;s <italic>Courtier</italic>. Thus at present the &#x003C;drawing&#x003E; tag in our XML is a placeholder containing a plaintext description of the picture. This is clearly insufficient. While marking up in such a manner would allow someone to search for pages with drawings, it would not allow for such searches to be sensibly refined: we can not differentiate between a caricature, a map, a diagram, or an architectural plan, just to name a few varieties of visual annotation. We intend to further revise this element of the schema before beginning to expand our corpus of books to include books by John Dee, and will be doing so in conjunction with art historians as well as historians of the book.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Phase II</title>
<p>The next steps for both the schema and the project as a whole are therefore expansionary. A new &#x003C;drawing&#x003E; layer is to be added to the schema, proof in itself of the pragmatic nature of XML: this expanded &#x003C;drawing&#x003E; tag will not render all the previous transcriptions invalid &#x2013; it is a &#x2018;backwards-compatible&#x2019; process &#x2013; but will allow it to be more responsive to the new challenges presented to the editor by the material to be transcribed. We also move out -wards from our kernel of Harvey-annotated material to include John Dee, allowing for comparative work. Similarly, the technological challenge is to extend outwards. Our XML transcripts will be presented alongside the image
<target target-type="page" id="page_183"/>of the printed page within a IIIF viewer accessible from the web. Users will be able to search and browse by text, keyword, mark, and symbol. We can move outwards from here by allowing the IIIF viewer to associate external web content with the images and transcriptions of the annotations: digital texts of books hosted elsewhere (from the Perseus Digital Library of classical texts, for example); images of buildings detailed in architectural sketches; even videos of alchemical demonstrations. This sort of expansion has only been made possible by creating, employing, and where necessary modifying a logical, valid XML schema. Most importantly, creating an XML schema that takes into account the scholarly traditions and skills of textual editing.</p>

<p>This essay considers how an XML-based edition can resolve some of the classic tensions traditionally encountered by editors: tensions between linguistic and bibliographic codes, texts and their contexts, and micro- and macro-scale research paradigms. The decision to produce an XML-based digital edition of Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s letters reflects the many advantages of this type of edition for this type of letter collection, most clearly illus trated by the web-edition itself (<uri>www.bessofhardwick.org).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_26"><sup>26</sup></xref> The intrinsic interest of the materials alone justifies an accessible online edition. As one of Elizabethan England&#x2019;s most famous figures, Bess of Hardwick (c.1521/2&#x2013;1608) is renowned for her repu -tation as a dynast, indomitable matriarch, and builder of great stately homes, including the magnificent Hardwick Hall and Chatsworth House. The 241 letters identified to and from Bess of Hardwick witness her extraordinary story, allowing us to reposition her as a complex woman of her times through study of her correspondence that stretches from servants, friends and family, to queens and officers of state.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_27"><sup>27</sup></xref> The web-edition of her correspondence is freely available without registra tion, no special software downloads are needed and users can save their own version of materials for off-line use or customisation. Ready access to appropriate materials is necessary in order to incorporate women and non-elites into the way we teach and research the past.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_28"><sup>28</sup></xref> Publishing manuscript letters and other archival materials online in a reliably edited robust digital form aligns with these imperatives more accurately to excavate the past.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Linguistic and bibliographic codes</title>
<p>One classic issue for editors has been described by Jerome McGann as the tension between linguistic and bibliographic codes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_29"><sup>29</sup></xref> That is, the tension between representation of semantic and rhetorical levels of language (the linguistic codes, prioritised by critical editions) and visual and palaeo graphical levels of language (the bibliographic codes, which include material features, prioritised by photographic facsimile editions). While their simul taneous
<target target-type="page" id="page_185"/>representation is awkward in print, solutions are provided by the multi-layered, multi-media nature of the digital environment, where text and image can be more readily combined. In the case of Bess&#x2019;s correspondence, the inclusion of colour images of 185 letters (a total of over 400 individual image files) would have been prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, the ability editorially to encode material features (such as folding patterns, space, ribbon, seals, and scribes) within the metadata, so that these can be searched for, means that the images are extensively and consistently integrated into the editorial apparatus (see Daybell, 2.4.2).</p>
<p>The images are not included for trivial &#x2018;decorative&#x2019; purposes, and their interest is not confined to a &#x2018;niche&#x2019; academic sub-discipline; the letters&#x2019; material features are fundamental to our view of Bess herself. As historians of the book and of reading have shown us, the physical form of the codex can impact upon literary interpretation. Comparably, the physical form of a letter can extend or inflect its meaning: visual and material aspects of early modern letters were designed to communicate meaning or encourage certain kinds of reader-response.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_30"><sup>30</sup></xref> A wide range of these features can be found across Bess&#x2019;s letters and it was through ribbon, space on the page, calligraphic penmanship, and decorated paper that writers registered their politeness or subordinate relation -ship to her, or she to them. The meanings communicated by Bess&#x2019;s letters, then, did not exist separately from their spatial and material forms. They require us to attend carefully to issues of production and reception if we are to acknowledge the terms and conditions upon which Bess participated within early modern manuscript culture. Bess&#x2019;s letters are not unusual in this respect; they illustrate many features characteristic of contemporary letter-writing practice.</p>
<p>The case in favour of capturing both bibliographic and linguistic codes, and the advantages of XML here, can be extended further in relation to transcription. The customisable nature of an XML-based edition means that the transcription of an individual letter is not fixed but rather layered. Different genres of edited texts (such as diplomatic, normalised, or modern ised) can be generated from a single encoded transcript. There are often very good editorial reasons for wanting to generate multiple texts or to customise viewing of transcripts.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_31"><sup>31</sup></xref> The debate over modernisation of early modern texts is explored further in this volume (2.3.1&#x2013;4). However, from my perspective, what is lost in the process of modernisation is a bank of original-spelling linguistic data, which is not only of interest to historical linguists, but essential for tracking the presence and identity of scribes. These scribes were often more than mere amanuenses &#x2013; they were trusted secretaries implicit in the co-creation of the persona performed in each letter. Further more, as men and women could act as scribes for one another, in various combinations, to track their roles is necessary if we are to trace the gender dynamics of the production and reception of early modern letters.</p>
<p>In addition to its value as data for scribal identification, retaining original spelling and punctuation offers present-day readers the opportunity to hear for themselves the dramatic and revealing switches of tone that can occur between letters from a single sender, and which correlate with changes of scribe. In Bess
<target target-type="page" id="page_186"/>of Hardwick&#x2019;s correspondence, many of her holograph letters to her husbands and servants were written in the conventionalised voice of the authoritative mistress of the household and betray a degree of linguistic naivety in their spelling and punctuation. By contrast, the letters she dispatched written in professional secretary-script hands (such as in the hand of Scribe D), which dealt with business matters, were stiff with standard legal conventions and openly displayed the scribe&#x2019;s Latin-based education and legal training. By contrast again, the letters she sent written in a variety of elegant italic-script scribal hands (such as in the hands of Scribes A and B) to high-status court contacts to petition and secure favour, were eloquently persuasive and demonstrated a grasp of epistolary diplomacy. These variations in language and tone, which correlated with Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s use of scribes, are only fully apparent to us when the letters are encountered in their original spelling, vocabulary, and syntax, as well as with visual features of the palaeography available. Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s considered use of different kinds of scribal and holograph writing for particular purposes characterised her engagement with scribal culture, and explains part of her extraordinary success as a letter-writer. It is only by presenting the language of her letters in its original form that we can represent the full range of modes of expression through which she constructed her authority and enacted her agency.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Texts and contexts</title>
<p>Another classic tension, not least for scholarly editors of letters, is between the need to attend to the individual life and the need to place that life in historical context; thus the editor prepares annotations and arranges apparatus to draw out themes judged to be important. In print editions the commentaries can rapidly become unfeasibly large (either disproportionate to the text on which they comment, or too bulky to fit into a volume). This issue of how to manage annotations has been discussed elsewhere in this volume, in particular in relation to literary texts (2.1.2 and 4.5). But it is also an issue pertinent to corpora of correspondence that are wide-ranging and thinly spread. Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s letters mention a diverse range of events, topics, people, and places that require context-specific elucidation. For example, there are over 90 correspondents in the project database. Biographical annotations have to take into account each individual corres pondent&#x2019;s relationship with Bess of Hardwick at particular points in time, which may change between letters written at different times (that is to say, their relationship may shift according to circumstances and changes in rela tive social status, such as following Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s repeated remarriages and then final widowhood as dowager Countess of Shrewsbury). Given the disparate, diffuse nature of Bess&#x2019;s correspondence &#x2013; which reads almost like an encyclopaedia of the Elizabethan period &#x2013; every letter requires its own biographical and historical context. While this level of annotation would become unwieldy in print, the flexible, hyper -linked nature of the XML-based edition prevents annotations from becoming intrusive, repetitive, or overwhelming the primary texts.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_187"/>The XML-based edition&#x2019;s capacity to allow texts to be sorted and ordered in a variety of ways (rather than being fixed into a single sequence) has significant implications for interpretation. Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s surviving corres -pondence is dominated by letters written &#x2018;to&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;from&#x2019; her; in a chronologically ordered print edition there would be a danger that she could be drowned out amid the clamour of the voices of other corres pondents. Meanwhile, online users can bring together only the letters from Bess, or only her holograph letters and, as such, the female subject can instantly be brought to centre stage, as required. This functionality allows scholars the ability to sort and filter by editorially constructed themes and topics (such as marital status, news networks, gift giving, motherhood, use of bearers, letter-packet typ ology). As such, it can offer fresh perspectives on Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s life and new routes into the correspondence that respond to current critical concerns and go well beyond the remit of the nineteenth-century catalogues.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Research paradigms</title>
<p>This ability to sift and focus on particular aspects of a correspondence collection has implications for how we might conceive of meta-editions in the future. As more collections of manuscripts are edited and published online, we are re-evaluating how clusters of correspondence relate to one another and how an edition such as this of Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s letters could be integrated into larger networks of early modern letters online. One response would be to expand the current edition: to incorporate not only letters to and from Bess but those which came within the remit of her reading experience, or which are about her. Given that we know Bess (as Countess of Shrewsbury) was regularly involved in reading and responding to her fourth husband the Earl of Shrewsbury&#x2019;s correspondence, which runs to many thousands of letters, it would be possible to envisage a meta-edition whereby reading experience becomes the boundary of the edition rather than addressee. To link and combine the overlapping epistolary networks of Bess and her husband or sons, or their shared news networks, would assist in expanding our understanding of her epistolary world. The extensibility of an XML-based edition keeps open these potentials for imagining future editions according to alternative criteria or in response to the availability of new texts, images, or catalogues.</p>
<p>An alternative response &#x2013; the current approach of this project &#x2013; is to combine data from the edition with other, larger projects. For scholars of women&#x2019;s history there is a tension between balancing micro-scale projects that attend scrupulously to the details of individual women&#x2019;s lives, and the imperative to integrate women&#x2019;s lives into the larger mainstream historical narrative. This tension &#x2013; between micro- and macro-scale research imperatives &#x2013; can be partially resolved in the case of Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s letters through data sharing. While the web-edition hosted at <uri>www.bessofhardwick.org presents Bess of Hardwick&#x2019;s letters cohered around her life and allows for scholarly attention to the minutiae of the letters&#x2019; textual, linguistic, and bibliographic forms, at the same time, the catalogue and textual data are being incorporated into other,
<target target-type="page" id="page_188"/>larger, macro-scale cata loguing and corpus-based projects (<ITALIC>EMLO</ITALIC>, <ITALIC>WEMLO</ITALIC>, and <ITALIC>CEEC</ITALIC>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_32"><sup>32</sup></xref> As such, and with each of these projects existing in parallel, the materials will be simultaneously available to historians and linguists asking a range of ques tions from different disciplinary perspectives. This ability to re-purpose and to incorporate micro- into macro-scale projects, which is one of the benefits of XML, is vital for integrating women&#x2019;s history into the wider historical narrative.</p>

<p>In an essay originally written in 1997, to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), Peter Robinson asked editors and digitisers a trio of deceptively simple questions: &#x2018;what sort of editions are we making? Why and for whom are we making them?&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_33"><sup>33</sup></xref> Nearly two decades later those same questions are still important. Producers of digitisation projects still need to ask them when they make what are fundamental decisions about presentation and content. In particular, they need to ask them when they consider the balance that they want to strike between text and image. Any digitisation project needs to think carefully about the emphasis that it gives to each and the extent to which it wishes to foreground the visual or the verbal.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_34"><sup>34</sup></xref> In broad terms, the distinction that needs to be made here is between choosing to build a digital archive or to create a digital edition: where the former focuses on images and the material, the latter privileges text and the verbal. Each has its merits, and the decision that an individual project takes should thus reflect both the material being digitised and the projected end users, as Robinson&#x2019;s three questions suggest. <italic>Scriptorium: Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts Online</italic> (<uri>http://scriptorium.english.cam.ac.uk), a three year AHRC-funded Resource Enhancement Project, based in the Faculty of English at the Uni versity of Cambridge, and the subject of this chapter, opted for the former &#x2013; and we made this decision for the reasons outlined above.</p>
<p>Scriptorium is a digital archive of high-resolution images of twenty manu script miscellanies and commonplace books from the period c. 1450&#x2013;1720. The manuscripts come from ten different archives or collections: the libraries of Trinity, St John&#x2019;s, Queens&#x2019;, King&#x2019;s and Emmanuel Colleges, Cambridge; Cambridge University Library, Leeds University Library, and the libraries of Lambeth Palace, Belton House, and Holkham Hall. We chose our manuscripts with the intention of providing a representative sample, chronologically, conceptually, and materially, of late medieval and early modern manuscript culture. Our manuscripts, therefore, include a fifteenth-century miscellany of household
<target target-type="page" id="page_189"/>information, a fifteenth-century collection of carols, Sir Thomas Smith&#x2019;s inventories (relating primarily to Hill Hall and Ankerwick, his house in London), a biblical miscellany compiled by Edward VI, a late sixteenth-century merchant&#x2019;s notebook, a pair of verse anthologies, an academic common place book under heads, a student notebook, a book of husbandry, a common place book belonging to Dorothy Browne and Elizabeth Lyttelton, a collection of reading notes com -piled by the first baronet of Belton, a book of private devotions compiled by Alathea Bethell, and an early eighteenth-century notebook belonging to a fellow of King&#x2019;s College, Cambridge. We also wanted to choose a representative sample of compilers &#x2013; men and women, elite and non-elite, scholarly and artisan &#x2013; and a similarly representative range of interests. The contents of our manuscripts, in this way, range from literary material to practical knowledge, from theological notes to rhetorical topics, from reading notes to observed particulars, and from financial accounts to listeners&#x2019; sermon notes. Other factors to influence our choice of manuscripts were access to material, ease of digitisation and photography (the tight binding of some, on the face of it, attractive candidates rendered them inappropriate for the project), and the consent of libraries to the subsequent publication of the digital images.</p>
<p>A further aim of the project was to bring together material that is now geographically disparate, and in a couple of cases fairly inaccessible, and thus facilitate the kind of comparative scholarship that computers, digitisation, and the Internet have recently enabled. <italic>Scriptorium</italic>&#x2019;s purpose is both conserva tionist and pedagogical &#x2013; to preserve these twenty manu scripts and to make them accessible through high-quality digital facsimiles and exhaustive codicological descriptions. The project&#x2019;s images, in both their RAW formats and as optimised PNG files, are securely dark-archived in DSpace&#x0040;Cambridge (<uri>www.repository. cam.ac.uk), the University of Cambridge&#x2019;s digital repository. We chose PNG as our optimised file format for its sustainability and its consequent potential for future usability. Lower-resolution images (JPEGs), published under Creative Commons licences and in collaboration with our partner libraries, are freely available to the public via the project&#x2019;s website. As the public side of the project, the website falls into three main sections: (i) browsable and searchable digital facsimiles of the twenty manuscripts, accompanied by extensive critical and descriptive materials, including full technical descriptions, comprehens ive indexes of contents and, where possible, complete lists of sources; (ii) an interactive pedagogical resource on late medieval and early modern hand -writing, designed for both the novice palaeographer and the more experienced user; and (iii) a selection of bibliographical and critical resources for the study of medieval and early modern manuscripts, including scholarly essays and articles, a general bibliography, and an interactive provenance image database. As a whole, the website therefore reflects the project&#x2019;s joint commitment to pedagogy and access.</p>
<p>Readers are able to search the <italic>Scriptorium</italic> website in a number of ways. The primary catalogue interface lists our twenty manuscripts by chronology, grouping them into seven 50-year blocks; the user can also isolate particular groups of manuscripts by searching by date range. In addition, the same page of the website allows the user to search by alphabetical topic: we have classified
<target target-type="page" id="page_190"/>and enumerated the manuscripts according to twenty-three generic subjects, thus allowing our users to make intellectual as well as chronological con -nections, and to search by keyword as well as date. These topics all relate to the manuscripts&#x2019; contents and are encoded in the project&#x2019;s manuscript descriptions. Finally, we also provide users with a single-line search box, thus enabling a full-text search: in keeping with standard practice, this searches all the website&#x2019;s documents for the user&#x2019;s query or term. In addition, the website also includes a highlight feature on its homepage, which serves as a supple -mentary finding aid and is intended to draw users&#x2019; attention to visually striking material that they may not be familiar with or would otherwise find. This feature incorporates a series of thumbnail images from each of the twenty manuscripts; these rotate on a regular basis, thus advertising the range of <italic>Scriptorium</italic> materials.</p>
<p>As a digital archive, <italic>Scriptorium</italic>&#x2019;s emphasis is on the integrity of the material book. The project website thus focuses on the representation of manuscripts as physical objects. Our technical descriptions are corres pondingly full: we provide information on collation and quiring, condition, handwriting, dating, decoration, binding, watermarks, provenance, and languages. We also record the materials used, dimensions and number of leaves; note the presence of pricking, ruling, and lining; and record and document the use of catchwords. Where collation is particularly complex &#x2013; for example, in Cambridge Univer -sity Library, MS Ll.1.18, a fifteenth-century household miscellany associated with the collegiate church of Southwell in Nottinghamshire &#x2013; we also provide a downloadable collation diagram, rendered as a PDF. Our website interface, too, corresponds with this focus on materiality. The primary way in which we present our manu scripts is through our &#x2018;Image View&#x2019;, in which images of the miscellanies and commonplace books, either as single pages or by openings, occupy the centre of the screen. Alongside each image there is an item box, which describes all the items visible, identifies any sources, and comments on the hands. Moreover, items here are not just limited to texts: we also record and describe all marks of provenance, contemporary and later, and all visual material.</p>
<p>The encoding policy that we chose also reflected this emphasis on the materiality of books. We described all our manuscripts in Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents compliant with the guidelines of TEI P5. For a further illustration of the advantages of XML to projects focusing on the material book, see Alison Wiggins&#x2019;s essay in this <italic>Handbook</italic> (3.2.1). Rather than the technical aspects of the process outlined here, Wiggins focuses on its editorial benefits and its ability to capture both linguistic and bibliographical codes. The TEI <italic>Guidelines</italic>, in their own words, &#x2018;make recommendations about suitable ways of representing those features of textual resources which need to be identified explicitly in order to facilitate processing by computer programs&#x2019;; in particular, they &#x2018;specify a set of markers (or tags) which may be inserted in the electronic representation of the text, in order to mark the text structure and other features of interest&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_35"><sup>35</sup></xref> While the TEI P5 <italic>Guidelines</italic> are by no means the only option for producing digital texts, they are the most widely used set of protocols for electronic manuscript description, and thus enable the highest
<target target-type="page" id="page_191"/>degree of interoperability. For an archival and codicological project such as <italic>Scriptorium</italic>, therefore, they were the obvious option. In the same way, before dark-archiving, we tagged all our images according to Dublin Core meta data standards. Dublin Core provides a standard set of terms or vocabulary, known as elements, for describing digital resources to ensure as wide a degree of interoperability as possible.</p>
<p>Each of our XML documents, which are freely available via the project website, consists of three sections: (i) the header; (ii) the facsimile; and (iii) the text. Here, we again followed standard encoding practice. As the TEI P5 <italic>Guidelines</italic> make clear, each &#x2018;full TEI document combines metadata describing it, represented by a &#x003C;teiHeader&#x003E; element, with the document itself, represented by a &#x003C;text&#x003E; element&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_36"><sup>36</sup></xref> Since <italic>Scriptorium</italic> is a digital archive, we needed to augment this basic structural requirement for TEI-conformant text by also including digital facsimiles. As with many other TEI projects, our facsimiles consist of a variety of different images for each source page and different kinds of image: high- and low-resolution images, and openings as well as single pages. Users of the <italic>Scriptorium</italic> website can thereby interface with the manuscripts in different ways, moving between thumbnails and larger images, and also between single-page views and two-page spreads. Each image in the facsimile is also given a unique identifier tag, usually, but not always, the page or leaf number. This tag enables cross-referencing with the text and, through the use of another standard TEI P5 tag, the &#x0040;facs attribute, associates each image with the corresponding point in that text.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_37"><sup>37</sup></xref> Creating these tags was one of the crucial steps in our workflow. During the image capture process, we allotted each image its identifier before shooting it and labelled the pages of the manuscripts accordingly. Without these labels, our XML documents would have been incomplete and we would not have been able to connect our digital facsimiles with our digital text.</p>
<p>For a project such as <italic>Scriptorium</italic>, the TEI header is particularly important, since it is here that the codicological information is encoded. In our XML documents, this information is located within what is known as the file description, tagged using the &#x003C;fileDesc&#x003E; element. Drawing on the &#x2018;Manuscript Description&#x2019; module in the P5 <italic>Guidelines</italic>, our descriptions include a manu script identifier, a list of contents under the &#x003C;msContents&#x003E; element, a physical description under the &#x003C;physDesc&#x003E; element, constituting the technical descrip -tion outlined above, and a history of the manuscript, incorporating the &#x003C;origin&#x003E; and &#x003C;provenance&#x003E; elements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_38"><sup>38</sup></xref> Particularly important for our project is the &#x003C;msContents&#x003E; component: an item-by-item description, arranged in consecutive order, which describes the intellectual contents of each manuscript. At its most basic, this consists of the unique identifier tag, cross-referring to the facsimile, and a descriptive note. More typically, it also includes inform ation about an item&#x2019;s title, author, heading or rubric, first and final line (incipit and explicit), and final subscription. This information is encoded with a further series of elements: &#x003C;title&#x003E;, &#x003C;author&#x003E;, &#x003C;rubric&#x003E;, &#x003C;incipit&#x003E;, &#x003C;explicit&#x003E;, and &#x003C;finalRubric&#x003E;. Additional information encoded in our headers includes a list of bibliographical references and a list of respondents, the authors, and other personages that feature in the manuscript. Each of our headers then concludes
<target target-type="page" id="page_192"/>with a short encoding description, identifying the document as a <italic>Scriptorium</italic> manuscript description and/or transcription, and a profile description, which dates the manuscript, identifies its languages, and provides a series of indexing keywords.</p>
<p>What <italic>Scriptorium</italic> does not offer are full transcriptions of any of the digitised manuscripts. Partly this was a question of resources: we simply did not have the time or the manpower to do this. But it was also a decision made on the basis of the kind of digitisation project that we wanted to produce. <italic>Scriptorium</italic> is explicitly a digital archive, not a digital edition. We do, however, provide sample transcriptions: exempla of each hand in each manuscript. These hands are then described in our TEI headers, with the kinds of script identified, characteristic graphs and punctuation documented and described, information about ductus, nib, and ink provided, and notes on deletions and corrections recorded. Where possible, we also identify the hands, cross-referring names to the list of respondents. Our intention was that this information, in conjunction with the sample transcriptions and our pedagogical resource, <italic>English Handwriting: An Online Course</italic> (<uri>http://scriptorium.english.cam.ac.uk/handwriting/), would provide the requisite intellectual access for the digitised items.</p>
<p>The method that I have outlined here is certainly not appropriate for every digitisation project. For some kinds of material, a more conventional digital edition, with full transcriptions of surviving witnesses, is desirable. Early modern texts produced specifically for manuscript circulation, such as Sir Philip Sidney&#x2019;s <italic>Letter to Queen Elizabeth</italic> (1579), are obvious examples.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_39"><sup>39</sup></xref> But for the kinds of artefact digitised by <italic>Scriptorium</italic>, the archival approach described in this essay is attractive. <italic>Scriptorium</italic> manuscripts are, in the main, non-linear texts: books that do not observe a chronological or palaeographical pro -gression from first leaf to last. Scribal stints overlap; items are started in one place and finished at another; notes are entered vertically as well as horizontally and upside down as well as from left to right and top to bottom. They are also the kinds of manuscript that are, in Jonathan Gibson&#x2019;s striking phrase, &#x2018;better thought of as texts in process than as unified works of art&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_40"><sup>40</sup></xref> Furthermore, they are books with a high volume of visual material: from the inventories, tables and charts of Queens&#x2019; College, Cambridge, MS 34, an Elizabethan merchant&#x2019;s notebook, to the faces in profile, cockerel, and drawing of &#x2018;ye Queen o&#x2019;th Amazons&#x2019; in Leeds University Library, Brotherton Collection, MS Lt 91, a late seventeenth-century miscellany of verse and prose. They are in this way the kinds of text for which, when edited, the integrity of the material book really does need to be preserved. They are also, therefore, a perfect illustration of when digitisers need to pay as much attention to image as to text, and so in turn an exemplary case of when to build a digital archive rather than a digital edition.</p>

<p>The Devonshire Manuscript (BL MS Add. 17,492) is a verse miscellany authored and compiled by a collection of sixteenth-century contributors, and dating from the 1530s&#x2013;1540s.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_41"><sup>41</sup></xref> As one of the most celebrated examples of an early modern collaborative text, the manuscript calls for an innovative approach to scholarly editing that reflects this polyvocal state. <italic>A Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript</italic> (<uri>http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Devonshire_Manuscript) is a Wikibook edition of the Devonshire Manu script that attempts to bring traditional scholarly editing practices and standards into conversation with comparatively recent developments in online environments.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_42"><sup>42</sup></xref> In doing so, the edition embodies contemporary editorial theories recognising the inherently social form and formation of texts alongside the collaborative writing, revision, and editing activities that shaped the original production of the Devonshire Manuscript. By publishing on Wikibooks (a partner site to Wikipedia specialising in book-length projects), we emphasise the collective, social ethos of the original document itself, as well as invite contributors beyond the traditional academic community.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_43"><sup>43</sup></xref> Throughout this process we have aimed to model the social edition and to address the questions raised by a social <italic>scholarly edition</italic>, and social editing.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_44"><sup>44</sup></xref></p>
<p>Acquired in 1848 by the British Museum, the Devonshire Manuscript contains approximately 200 items (including complete lyrics, verse fragments, excerpts from longer works, anagrams, and other ephemeral jottings) on 198 pages (including endpapers) bound in a handwritten volume and inscribed in over a dozen hands by a coterie of men and women involved with Queen Anne Boleyn&#x2019;s court.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_45"><sup>45</sup></xref> The manuscript has long been valued as a source of Sir Thomas Wyatt&#x2019;s poetry, as he composed 129 of the 200 items in the manu -script (although they are not in his hand).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_46"><sup>46</sup></xref> The Devonshire Manuscript, however, is much more than an important witness in the Wyatt canon; it is also a snapshot into the scribal practices of male and female lyricists, scribes, and compilers in the Henrician court, as well as the first example of men and women writing together in sustained fashion in English.</p>
<p>194 <italic>Raymond Siemens</italic> et al.</p>
<p><italic>A Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript</italic> seeks to publish the contents of the original manuscript in their entirety, move beyond the limitations of a Wyatt-centered focus, and concentrate on the volume&#x2019;s social, literary, and historical contexts. To accomplish these goals, this edition preserves the socially mediated textual and extra-textual elements of the manuscript that have been elided or ignored in previous transcrip tions. These &#x2018;paratexts&#x2019; make significant contributions to the meaning and appreciation of the manuscript miscellany and its constituent parts: anno tations, glosses, names, ciphers, and various jottings; the telling proximity of one work to another; significant gatherings of materials; illustrations entered into the manuscript alongside the text; and so forth. With its col lection of courtly lyrics, pastiche of medieval and contemporary poetry, density of textual voices, and often-uncertain authorship and attribution, the Devonshire Manuscript demonstrates how textual production and interpretation were foundational to those reading and writing within this Tudor coterie. The collaborative, social editing, and authorship processes of the original contributors are visibly evident throughout the manu -script, offering us a sketch of personal, socio-textual relationships. The physical and social elements of the Devonshire Manuscript lend themselves to digital editing and publication processes that more appropriately represent the manifold nature of the volume than publication in a print environment is able to do. In reflecting an inherent collaborative sociality, our editorial pro cess hearkens back to the collaborative roots of the Devonshire Manuscript.</p>
<p>The rise of Web 2.0 activities (i.e., active user contribution and reuse of online materials) indicates an important cultural moment for knowledge production. Individuals around the globe are now in a position to interact with digital content in ways never before possible. In order to acknowledge and engage with newly initiated knowledge producers, and to reach outside of the university, we built a scholarly edition on the principles of open access, editorial trans -parency (in both production and dissemination), and public engagement. We integrated early modern content and scholarly editing practices with web-based environments maintained by established social and social-editorial com -mun ities &#x2013; most notably on Wikibooks, a cross-section of intellectual research activity and the social media practices that define Web 2.0. As a multi-authored and multi-edited endeavour, Wikibooks instantiates earlier theoretical argu -ments that texts are created by a com munity of individuals; as Arthur Marotti argues, &#x2018;production, reproduction, and reception are all socially mediated&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_47"><sup>47</sup></xref> To put this theory into practice, we extended our editorial conversations into multiple pre-existing Web 2.0 and social media platforms. Some of these interactions were more public (e.g. Twitter, blogs, Wikibook discussion pages, dedicated Renaissance and early modern online community spaces) and some more private (e.g. one-on-one Skype-enabled interviews with our advisory group).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_48"><sup>48</sup></xref> In creating <italic>A Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript</italic> we ask, what could the outcome of scholarly editing be if, like the original Devonshire Manuscript contributors, we understand the edition-building process as inherently collaborative? What does a scholarly edition look like when it involves participants who may or may not identify as scholars?</p>

<p>Our Wikibook edition of the Devonshire Manuscript pushes the limits of what a print edition can realistically achieve &#x2013; including in sheer size. In addition to a general and textual introduction, the online edition includes extensive hand sample tables that present our paleographic attribution process to public scrutiny; witnesses that reflect the poem&#x2019;s textual legacy; biographies and genealogical diagrams that clarify the relationship between the manuscript&#x2019;s sixteenth-century compilers; and an extensive bibliography of quoted and relevant sources. Courtesy of Adam Matthew Digital, we have included the facsimile image of each page of the manuscript alongside transcribed content and explanatory notes.</p>
<p>In order to keep the editorial and encoding process transparent, the Wikibook edition also includes links to the baseline XML-encoded tran -scription. The &#x2018;Discussion&#x2019; tab on each wiki page allows conversation on each item, thereby extending the original social context of the Devonshire Manuscript. The complete record of changes to each page, including every change ever made, is also openly available on Wikibooks via the &#x2018;View history&#x2019; tab. For example, the &#x2018;Discussion&#x2019; page for the poem &#x2018;It was my choyse It Was my chaunce&#x2019; (<uri>https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Devonshire_Manuscript/It_</p>

<p>Editorial processes of <italic>A Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript</italic> began long before selecting Wikibooks as a publication platform. In 2001, work on a digital edition of the manuscript began with primary source transcription, based on examination of both the original document and a microfilm of the Devonshire Manuscript, both provided by the British Library. Members of the Devonshire Manuscript Editorial Group (DMSEG), made up of scholars, postdoctoral fellows, graduate researchers, and programmers and self-selected members of the public, prepared and transcribed (in a blind process) two independent transcriptions from the microfilm. The transcribers collated the two paper copies manually, and the resultant rough text was resolved as far as possible using expanded paper prints and enlarged images. Their transcriptions were largely in accord with one another, and any remaining areas of uncer tainty were resolved with manual reference to the original document itself by different members of the DMSEG. This final, collated transcription forms the textual basis for all editorial activity for the project. Following this process, the team then encoded the text in XML according to Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines and maintained regular documentation to ensure that neither the original encoder nor any subsequent encoder would lack a basis from which to proceed. This XML-encoded transcription is openly available for download and examination as part of the edition. Beginning in 2010 and throughout the production of <italic>A Social Edition of the Devonshire Manu script</italic>, we also consulted and conducted qualitative interviews with members of an advisory group. Forming this group provided a unique opportunity to invite potential users and reviewers to shape the process and products associated with the social edition. In November 2011,
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_197"/>Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL)-based mem bers of the DMSEG began converting the TEI-encoded text into Wikimarkup, the unique language designed for wiki publication. The team then moved the text, appendices, glosses, com -mentary, and textual notes into Wikibooks. Since then, the ETCL team has amplified the base text with additional images of the manuscript, witness transcriptions, an extensive bibliography, and XML files containing the encoded transcription of the manuscript. Consequently, the Wikibook has become a hybridised edition-research environment for both early modern scholars and Tudor enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The Wikibook platform gives us the opportunity to recognise and assign credit for important editorial work, like discussion and feedback, which are central to scholarly revision and authorship but can be difficult to monitor and quantify. Originally, we considered the discussion pages ideal for this type of discussion and editorial record keeping. Through conversation with an established Wikibooks editor we realised that the discussion pages are, in fact, more often used for personal commentary and disputes than editorial

<p>suggestions. Although the technology readily supports our original inten tion, the cultural practices of the user community required us to alter our expectations. Even so, all edits to all pages of the project are recorded and available for viewing on each page&#x2019;s &#x2018;View history&#x2019; tab. Rather than relying on the discussion pages for editorial discussions, we made the most substantive changes in Wikibooks based on feedback from our advisory group, which they offered privately via one-on-one Skype sessions and more publically on Iter Community, an online social and collaboration space for medieval and Renaissance scholars. While the Skype sessions were by invitation, the team welcomed feedback through social media, blogs, and email. Using social media allowed us to integrate a new step into the editorial process &#x2013; a step that fills the gap between initial planning stages and concluding peer review reports. Producing an edition &#x2018;live&#x2019; in con sultation with various groups (including the Devonshire Manuscript editorial group, the advisory group, and Wikibooks users) and across multiple media engendered an edition that adroitly met the needs of its readers. Employing and participating in various platforms alerted us to multiple priorities across groups, as well as forced us to think through how we might foster productive and equitable interactions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_49"><sup>49</sup></xref></p>
<p>As outlined above, the Devonshire Manuscript&#x2019;s social structure and content strongly influenced our choice of Wikibooks as a publication platform. Incorporating social media and Web 2.0 practices with scholarly editing activities recasts the primary editor as a <italic>facilitator</italic> rather than <italic>progenitor</italic> of scholarly editions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_50"><sup>50</sup></xref> The social edition models a new kind of scholarly discourse network that hopes to eschew traditional, institutionally reinforced hierarchical structures and relies, instead, upon those that are community-generated both within the traditional academy and without. Although developing <italic>A Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript</italic> involved an aca demic editorial group working in much the same way as others have collaborated on scholarly editions, this project differs from others in its purposeful selection of a public venue (Wikibooks) and its commitment to welcoming others, largely through social media, who were not always explicitly invited to engage in scholarly editions hitherto. Situated at the intersection of multiple vectors &#x2013; of digital humanities, the history of the book, social knowledge creation, and the growing cross-fertilisation of academic and wiki culture &#x2013; the project has facilitated knowledge transfer and creation between multiple editorial communities with varying values and priorities, engaging a robust academic community and working to integrate citizen scholars.The intersection of social media and scholarly editing thus has a destabilising effect, as it prompts models of textual interaction and intervention that represent the scholarly text as a process rather than a product.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_51"><sup>51</sup></xref> By privileging process over final product, the DMSEG aims to render transparent editorial work and to develop a model of the social scholarly edition that successfully draws together diverse communities of scholars.</p>

<p>The argument presented by a scholarly edition can usually be traced to the vision of a single editor or a very small group of editors. But is it possible or even desirable for an edition to present multiple &#x2013; perhaps competing &#x2013; arguments? As lately conceived and practised, the social edition promises to enable the presentation of differing interpretations and arguments, prompting us to reconsider some of our fundamental ideas about the form and function of scholarly editions. This essay reflects on one particular aspect of scholarly editing &#x2013; annotation &#x2013; and examines some of the theoretical issues behind crowd -sourcing annotations of a literary work.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_52"><sup>52</sup></xref></p>
<p><italic>Ossian Online</italic> is a project whose aim is to generate new knowledge about James Macpherson&#x2019;s <italic>Ossian</italic> poems: a key, if controversial, eighteenth-century literary work. It will present linked TEI-encoded texts of editions published under Macpherson&#x2019;s authority from 1760&#x2013;73, and will enable crowdsourced critical commentary by means of a collaborative annotation platform. Since its first publication in 1760, <italic>Ossian</italic>&#x2019;s claims to cultural authenticity have pro -voked dissent and disagreement. Significantly, Macpherson&#x2019;s response to criticisms of his work was characteristically <italic>editorial</italic>: simulating textual genetics via scholarly apparatus. Just as Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s accusation of inauthenticity stemmed from the fact that &#x2018;the editor or author could never shew the original&#x2019; of his supposed translations, so Macpherson&#x2019;s publications strove to stabilise their meaning through the medium of print.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_53"><sup>53</sup></xref> During the author&#x2019;s lifetime his printed editions react to both enthusiastic and hostile readings of his &#x2018;antique&#x2019; poetry. The first volume of &#x2018;fragments&#x2019; was subsequently reconfigured and absorbed by Macpherson into longer epic works, which were themselves in turn further edited and altered: annotated and de-annotated, given critical paratexts, such as Hugh Blair&#x2019;s preface to <italic>Fragments of Ancient Poetry</italic> and Macpherson&#x2019;s &#x2018;Dissertation Concerning the Antiquity of the Poems of Ossian&#x2019; (1762). The 1765 <italic>Works of Ossian</italic> gathered together the extant poems with footnotes emphasising their biblical and classical resonances and Gaelic origins. In 1773 Macpherson produced his &#x2018;authoritative&#x2019; edition of the <italic>Poems of Ossian</italic>. The changing editions of his poetry thus produce a battery of paratext: appendices, insertions, expansions, and alterations aimed at simultaneously bolstering credibility and maximising commercial success. From the outset, then, edition functioned as argument for Macpherson, with annotation as arsenal for cultural credibility.</p>
<p>As Kristine Louise Haugen has shown, despite (or because of) the absence of any ur-manuscript and its oral ancestry, Macpherson&#x2019;s apparatus repeatedly adopts the markers of an edited textual tradition: using asterisks to signal lacunae, noting interpolations, adding scholarly glosses and etymologies, analogues and sources, and in the second edition of <italic>Fragments of Ancient Poetry</italic>, introducing
<target target-type="page" id="page_200"/>variants.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_54"><sup>54</sup></xref> It is precisely <italic>Ossian</italic>&#x2019;s self-conscious foregrounding of textual history that makes it an ideal case for interrogating the practices of scholarly editing. Macpherson utilises the power of editorial practice to assert meaning. As Fiona Stafford has noted, however, Macpherson&#x2019;s increasingly scholarly footnotes activated contemporary readers&#x2019; hermeneutic suspicion, even as they modelled a fabricated historical objectivity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_55"><sup>55</sup></xref> Thus <italic>Ossian</italic>&#x2019;s editorial pose solicits critical evaluations from its audience, its authorial distance granting the reader an unusual degree of interpretive authority. This model of devolved authority makes it a good candidate for collaborative annotation, as does its disciplinary breadth. Given Macpherson&#x2019;s composite of Gaelic sources, classical principles, and its impact on European literature, <italic>Ossian</italic> invites a range of expert anno -tators, rather than a single figure. <italic>Ossian Online</italic> proposes to solicit an array of users to collab orate, debate, and annotate the edition, synthesising a broad range of disciplinary perspectives and a dynamic community of research in a digital medium, making this a truly social edition.</p>
<p>However, certain editors and critics have voiced concerns about the use of crowdsourcing in scholarly editing. Paul Eggert has argued that the editorial form itself is an &#x2018;argument&#x2019;, where the wealth of a textual archive is rhetorically presented by an editor, presenting material &#x2018;to facilitate reasoned <italic>dis</italic>agree -ment&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_56"><sup>56</sup></xref> Extending Eggert&#x2019;s logic, Peter Shillingsburg believes that annotation by committee may not only dilute editorial account ability but also detract from the edition&#x2019;s ability to present a cogent argument to its readership.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_57"><sup>57</sup></xref> Eggert&#x2019;s identification of two separate &#x2018;impulses&#x2019; of the scholarly edition &#x2013; archival and editorial &#x2013; is important, but he believes crowdsourcing&#x2019;s role should be confined to the archival. He sees the digital environment as one that allows the editor to &#x2018;spread their wings rather than . . . leaving the interpretation to others&#x2019;, thus inadvertently succumbing to the fallacy that editors are merely critics <italic>manqu&#x00E9;s</italic>. The digital space is one where textual scholars and others with differ ent critical dispositions can contribute to an interdisciplinary forum.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_58"><sup>58</sup></xref> Just as these debates challenge us to think carefully about the boundaries of duty and responsibility of the scholarly editor, using crowd -sourcing for one particular part of the editorial process &#x2013; annotation &#x2013; helps us to examine how develop ments in technology and in editorial theory may have shifted and refined the tasks of the scholarly editor and the possibilities of the scholarly edition.</p>
<p>In thinking about the function of annotation and its argumentative nature, and the role that a crowd might play in its creation, some general principles about annotation are worth considering. Broadly speaking, annotation serves to aid and improve readers&#x2019; understanding of historical documents, and its form might be divided into three general categories: notes on document provenance; textual notes; and contextual or informational notes. The nature and extent of the annotation in an edition will be directed by the audience for that edition, and by their particular needs. The complexity and familiarity of the documents will also play an important role in this determination. The balance between these categories of annotation can vary quite significantly between editions: the student edition for the commercial publisher will likely feature more contextual and informational
<target target-type="page" id="page_201"/>annotation, while the scholarly edition for an academic audience may veer towards more objective declara tions about provenance and textual issues. So, when we speak about the possibility of crowdsourcing the annotation of <italic>Ossian</italic>, what exactly are we proposing?</p>
<p>There are certain aspects of the scholarly edition that are difficult to imagine the crowd performing. Annotations from the first two categories (provenance, textual) primarily articulate the findings of the professional scholarly editor and require a certain level of specialised knowledge: for example, that involving the collation of textual variants or the completion of descriptive bibliographical work. These categories fall within the ambit of the textual scholar and bibliographer, while contextual or informational annotation is more often the preserve of the literary critic or literary histor ian. The boundaries between these roles are, of course, highly permeable, and the scholarly editor must change roles frequently in the course of his or her professional work. How, though, has the increasing use of technology within the field changed or challenged the scope of those roles? Does the emergent social edition redefine the tasks of the scholarly editor, or make their execution through crowdsourcing a possibility?</p>
<p>The tasks that are required of the crowd in academic crowdsourcing projects occupy different positions on the spectrum that runs from micro- to macro-tasking. For instance, on a spectrum of subjectivity, transcription is a <italic>relatively</italic> objective process but the addition of structural or interpretive mark-up to the text moves into the realm of the subjective. Micro-tasking resides at the more objective end of this spectrum, and uses &#x2018;crowdsourcing to solve many detailed problems of the sort that would be difficult to solve computationally&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_59"><sup>59</sup></xref> The aspiration of generating new knowledge based on the specific skills of participants is a characteristic of macro-tasking: a crowdsourcing endeavour involving more complex &#x2018;open-ended, socially negotiated tasks [that] may go further than processing information&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_60"><sup>60</sup></xref> The kinds of contributions invited by <italic>Ossian Online</italic> &#x2013; critical interpretation born of close reading informed by disciplinary knowledge &#x2013; demand a more specialised contributor, and inevitably call into question the <italic>crowd</italic> in crowdsourcing. <italic>Transcribe Bentham</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_61"><sup>61</sup></xref> has already identified this misnomer, describing its experience as more accurately one of <italic>crowd-sifting</italic>, where a self-selecting group of highly engaged individual contributors emerges from an initially open call.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_62"><sup>62</sup></xref></p>
<p>Thus, transcription and annotation occupy different practical and ideo -logical positions within the process of scholarly editing. Both are part of a tradition which the social edition, and its &#x2018;embrace [of] social networking and commensurate tools&#x2019; promises to inform and extend.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_63"><sup>63</sup></xref> If transcription is an essential part in establishing and presenting an accurate text, anno tation spans a subjective range from demonstrable empirical observations about the texts (the information of critical apparatus), through contextual or documentary information, to literary-critical commentary. The more subjective and special -ised the task, the more necessarily the crowd becomes circumscribed. However, the more that interpretation is prescribed, the greater the obligation to qualify the term <italic>crowdsourcing</italic>, or to define precisely the model of collaborative interpretation.</p>
<target target-type="page" id="page_202"/>
<p><italic>Ossian Online</italic> will crowdsource the contextual annotation of its texts, in recognition of <italic>Ossian</italic>&#x2019;s transdisciplinary appeal, and on the understanding that its very broad scope and interest could not be described with satisfaction by the annotations of its two editors. The social edition offers scholarly editing the possibility of devolving contextual interpretation of texts to its users. The affordances of digital media &#x2018;allow for the creation of better-than-print editions, in which the role of the editor has changed and what can be offered to the reader has radically expanded&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_64"><sup>64</sup></xref> These editions, like their printed antecedents, will not offer definitiveness about the textual situations of the works they present: instead, they will offer more capacious forms of argument about those works. <italic>Ossian Online</italic>&#x2019;s use of social annotation brings it closer to Eggert&#x2019;s vision of the convergence of the text-critical, literary-critical, and literary-historical enabled by digital editions. These shifts towards the social &#x2013; enabling and accommodating multiple interpretive perspectives and possibilities &#x2013; provoke questions and encourage reflections about the funda -mental duties and responsibilities of the scholarly editor and the transformative potential of the digital edition.</p>

<title>&#x2018;If this be error: editing Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnets&#x2019;</title>
<p>In the opening pages of <italic>From Writer to Reader</italic> (1978), a work committed to redressing the &#x2018;sadly inadequate&#x2019; state of the then available editions, Philip Gaskell lays down the responsibilities of the would-be editor. Chief among this is the duty to &#x2018;presen[t] a text purged as far as possible of accidental errors and of deliberate but unauthorized alterations&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Gaskell&#x2019;s caveat here (&#x2018;as far as possible&#x2019;) encapsulates one theme of the case study that follows: namely the challenge of identifying error. As the ensuing chapter argues (using Shakes -peare&#x2019;s <italic>Sonnets</italic> and <italic>Coriolanus</italic> &#x2013; two recent editorial projects &#x2013; as case studies), it is not always easy to ascertain whether or not some thing is an error, or &#x2013; once spotted &#x2013; to know how best to handle it. Gaskell&#x2019;s strictures also introduce the second theme of the essay: when he advocates removing &#x2018;deliberate but unauthorized alterations&#x2019;, he is targeting the non-accidental interventions (made, for example, by earlier editors, publishers, and censors) that have accreted during the dissemination history of the text in question, but his words should sound a warning to the <italic>current</italic> editor about the way in which their own editorial process has the potential to introduce unwarranted emendations, as well as to &#x2018;purge&#x2019; the text of them. Further to that, how editors categorise and treat &#x2018;errors&#x2019; and &#x2018;unauthorized alterations&#x2019; also impacts, profoundly, on the reading experience (a third and important theme of this case study).</p>
<p>Correcting errors, or possible errors, is particularly problematic because &#x2013; unless pushed to do so by some difficulty in the text &#x2013; readers do not necessarily consult the annotations that are designed to support their reading, let alone the textual notes (particularly when those are couched in technical terms, printed in small type, and corralled into a separate section of the volume). <italic>The Riverside Shakespeare</italic> attempts to avoid this readerly inertia by enclosing in square brackets all &#x2018;substantive&#x2019; alterations to the copy-text.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_2"><sup>2</sup></xref> This practice is, however, rather intrusive and also risks undermining the authority of justifiable and well-testified emendations. Nonetheless, without such signals, alterations to the text can pass unnoticed, and the words on the page acquire an authority to which they may have little claim. That being the case, editors need to think very carefully about what is at stake for the reader before they intervene.</p>
<p>Take Shakespeare&#x2019;s Sonnet 127. In the 1609 Quarto (Q), the third quatrain read
<p>Therefore my Mistersse eyes are Rauen blacke, Her eyes so suted, and they mourners seeme, At such who not borne faire no beauty lack, [10] Slandring Creation with a false esteeme,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_3"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_210"/>Editors frequently revise these lines, substituting &#x2018;brows&#x2019; or &#x2018;hairs&#x2019; for one of the occurrences of &#x2018;eyes&#x2019; (ll. 8, 9) to avoid the repetition, a move to revise that originated with Edward Capell (1713&#x2013;81), who broke new ground in the eighteenth century as the first Shakespearean scholar to return to the sixteenth-and seventeenth-century editions, instead of relying on the received text. Capell never published his version of the <italic>Sonnets</italic>, but his annotated copy of Bernard Lintott&#x2019;s 1715 edition of the 1609 Quarto, now housed in the Wren Library, Trinity College Cambridge, contains suggested emendations which were often followed by Edmond Malone and which, through him, influenced the subse -quent editorial tradition.</p>
<p>The most common emendation among editors since the mid-twentieth century &#x2013; namely, to replace the second &#x2018;eyes&#x2019; (l. 9) with &#x2018;brows&#x2019; &#x2013; is a tempting one. &#x2018;Brows&#x2019; fits metrically (a monosyllable is required) and grammatically, since the plural &#x2018;they&#x2019; demands a plural subject (although that plural subject could comprise the &#x2018;eyes&#x2019; of l. 9 along with a single &#x2018;brow&#x2019; from l. 10). The image of black brows as mourners and the idea of a dark-complexioned mistress who will prove black beautiful (&#x2018;fair&#x2019;) also finds Shakespearean precedent in <italic>Love&#x2019;s Labours Lost</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>O, if in black my lady&#x2019;s brows be deck&#x2019;d, It mourns that painting and usurping hair Should ravish doters with a false aspect: And therefore is she born to make black fair.</p>
<p>(4.3.254&#x2013;61)</p>
<p>However, Q&#x2019;s version &#x2013; although not so elegant as the revision &#x2013; does make sense, since at this time &#x2018;and&#x2019; could mean &#x2018;as if&#x2019;: compare <italic>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</italic> (&#x2018;I will roar you and &#x2018;twere any nightingale&#x2019;, 1.2.83&#x2013;4) and <italic>Troilus and Cressida</italic> (&#x2018;O, he smiles valiantly [. . .] and &#x2018;twere a cloud in autumn&#x2019;, 1.2.124&#x2013;6).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_4"><sup>4</sup></xref> The emended line, avoiding the repetition of &#x2018;eyes&#x2019;, might be &#x2018;better&#x2019; poetry, but that in itself is not sufficient argu ment for an emendation. We do not know that Shakespeare did not write &#x2018;eyes&#x2019; twice, but we do know for sure that Q&#x2019;s readers would have read that word twice. In changing &#x2018;eyes&#x2019; to &#x2018;brow&#x2019; (or brows) we are thus swapping a certainty for an uncertainty, and we are doing so because we want Shakespeare to be as good as we think he should be. In doing so, we quietly shape the text into something we would rather read.</p>
<p>Editorial intervention thus risks meddling with a line that does not need emending, while inaction can mean retaining one that does. Either way, the possibility of arriving at a text which achieves Gaskellian ideals of being &#x2018;accurate&#x2019; and &#x2018;authoritative&#x2019; seems increasingly problematic.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_5"><sup>5</sup></xref> There are also moments at which there is something to gain if we resist &#x2018;cleaning up&#x2019; Q. Sonnet 41, which comes &#x2013; in Q&#x2019;s sequence &#x2013; in the first cluster of sonnets to introduce the idea of the love triangle, finds the poet-speaker attempting to exonerate the friend for his apparent dalliance with the mistress:
<disp-quote>
<p>Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits, When I am some-time absent from thy heart,
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_211"/>Thy beautie, and thy yeares full well befits, For still temptation followes where thou art. Gentle thou art, and therefore to be wonne, [5] Beautious thou art, therefore to be assailed. And when a woman woos, what womans sonne, Will sourely leaue her till he haue preuailed.</p>
<p>(sigs D1r&#x2013;v)</p>
<p>Editors since Malone&#x2019;s edition in 1780 regularly emend the &#x2018;he&#x2019; in l. 8 to &#x2018;she&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_6"><sup>6</sup></xref> But is this an error? From the outset, this is a sonnet which unsettles our expectations: we have &#x2018;pretty wrongs&#x2019;, not &#x2018;petty&#x2019; ones in l. 1; line 5 subverts the proverb &#x2018;all women may be won&#x2019; by applying it to a man. Having &#x2018;he&#x2019; in l. 8 when the reader might expect &#x2018;she&#x2019; could therefore be seen as another instance within the sonnet which rejects the anticipated reading. Further to that, retaining Q&#x2019;s &#x2018;he&#x2019; reveals the poet-speaker&#x2019;s strain as he attempts to excuse the friend: the woman might have begun the seduction, but the man might see it through, a possibility that the switch in pronouns concedes, even as the poet-speaker might prefer to overlook it.</p>
<p>Little words matter, in other words. It is often taken as read by editors of Shakespeare&#x2019;s <italic>Sonnets</italic> that both of Q&#x2019;s compositors (&#x2018;A&#x2019; and &#x2018;B&#x2019;) recurrently mistake &#x2018;thy&#x2019; for &#x2018;their&#x2019;, perhaps as many as fifteen occasions between them, although not every instance is accepted as an error by every editor.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_7"><sup>7</sup></xref> The possibility of such error arises from misreading a contracted form of &#x2018;thy&#x2019; (formed from a y-thorn and superscript) as a contracted form of &#x2018;their&#x2019;. Manuscript contractions for &#x2018;thy&#x2019; and &#x2018;their&#x2019; are much rarer than contractions for &#x2018;the&#x2019; (&#x2018;ye&#x2019;) or &#x2018;that&#x2019; (&#x2018;yt&#x2019;), but they were nonetheless in use, as G. Blakemore Evans shows through his analysis of compositorial errors in the 1596 quarto of <italic>Edward III</italic>, where &#x2018;their&#x2019; is twice misread as &#x2018;thy&#x2019;, and &#x2018;your&#x2019; as &#x2018;their&#x2019; in 2.1 (a scene possibly authored by Shakespeare).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_8"><sup>8</sup></xref> The first of Q&#x2019;s potential thy/their errors appears in Sonnet 26. Here l. 12 makes little sense, if left as in Q (&#x2018;To show me worthy of their sweet respect&#x2019;, sig. C2v), since there is no plural subject to which &#x2018;their&#x2019; could refer: both grammar and content would therefore suggest that &#x2018;thy [. . .] respect&#x2019; (the friend&#x2019;s admiration) is what the poet-speaker seeks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the question of error &#x2013; and emendation &#x2013; is not always quite so obvious, as can be illustrated by turning to the very next sonnet in Q&#x2019;s sequence, in which the poet-speaker declares &#x2018;my thoughts (from far where I abide)/ Intend a zelous pilgrimage to thee [the absent friend]&#x2019; (27.5&#x2013;6, sig. C2v). When Q recounts, in the subsequent quatrain, how &#x2018;my soules imaginary sight/ Presents their shaddoe to my sightless view&#x2019; (ll. 9&#x2013;10), we are presented with a potential problem. Is this the friend&#x2019;s image (&#x2018;shadow, n.&#x2019;, OED sense 6a), with &#x2018;their&#x2019; here being a misreading of &#x2018;thy&#x2019;, an altera tion first made by Capell? Or is Q in fact correct, with &#x2018;their shaddoe&#x2019; referring back to &#x2018;the thoughts&#x2019; mentioned five lines earlier, as W.G. Ingram and Theodore Redpath argue, in a rare example of resistance to Capell&#x2019;s emendation?<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_9"><sup>9</sup></xref> In this case, despite Ingram and Redpath&#x2019;s advocacy, such a distance between the pronoun and its referent seems unlikely, while the idea of the transformative, beautifying power
<target target-type="page" id="page_212"/>of the &#x2018;shaddoe&#x2019; which the poem goes on to describe (as it &#x2018;Makes blacke night beauteous, and her old face new&#x2019;, l. 12) is entirely consistent with the portrayal of the youth elsewhere in the <italic>Sonnets</italic>, as is the poet-speaker&#x2019;s ability to imagine him into being when absent from him (see, for example, Sonnet 43: &#x2018;But when I sleep, in dreames they [my eyes] looke on thee&#x2019;, l. 3).</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, it is clear that something is wrong with the Q-text. Errors in this category are most obvious when they involve a rhyme word, as in the final quatrain of Sonnet 25:
<disp-quote>
<p>The painefull warrier famosed for worth, After a thousand victories once foild, [10] Is from the booke of honour rased quite, And all the rest forgot for which he toild.</p>
<p>(sig. C2r)</p>
<p>Here &#x2018;worth&#x2019; (l. 9) fails to rhyme with &#x2018;quite&#x2019; (l. 11). Most editors consequently emend this to &#x2018;might&#x2019; (following Capell) or &#x2018;fight&#x2019; (following Malone); a more select band follows J.P. Collier and emends &#x2018;quite&#x2019; to &#x2018;forth&#x2019; (l. 9). There is undoubtedly an error in the text; nevertheless, it is unlikely to be a compositorial one: it is hard to see how &#x2018;worth&#x2019; could be misread as &#x2018;might&#x2019; or &#x2018;fight&#x2019;, or &#x2018;quite&#x2019; as &#x2018;forth&#x2019;, or how those words might be misheard as such by someone working by ear; nor are these likely memorial reconstructions, since they breach the rhyme (one of the strongest mnemonic aids, along with meter). &#x2018;mi&#x2019; could feasibly be misread as &#x2018;wo&#x2019;, but C.J. Sisson&#x2019;s suggestion that the rest of the word is illegible because &#x2013; being near the edge of the manuscript leaf &#x2013; the end of the line is mutilated is unconvincing, since l. 9 is by no means the longest in the poem. The mistake must therefore be in the copy itself, possibly the result of a process of revision remaining incomplete. Any substitutions for &#x2018;worth&#x2019; or &#x2018;quite&#x2019; are conjectural, and it is more honest (and interesting) to preserve Q&#x2019;s reading, which seems to show the sonnet in a process of transition.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the example above, it is crucial to try to reconstruct how an error might have arisen (be it the fault of a compositor, scribe, or even the author), since that may well affect how we choose to deal with it. When assessing whether or not something is an error, and hypothesising its origin, the evidence of late sixteenth-century palaeography, orthography, grammar, and idiom &#x2013; as well as the form and context of the particular sonnet &#x2013; are all important measures, as can be seen in the treatment of Sonnet 129.11, where Q reads as a series of adjectival phrases: &#x2018;A blisse in proof and proud and very wo,&#x2019; (sig. H3v). The line as rendered makes sense. The first &#x2018;editor&#x2019; of the <italic>Sonnets</italic>, John Benson, did not treat it as corrupt and left it as it stood in 1640, in <italic>Poems: written by Wil. Shake-speare. Gent.</italic>, in contrast to some of the obvious errors that he did correct (such as Q&#x2019;s &#x2018;you selfe&#x2019; at 13.7, or &#x2018;rn&#x2019;wd&#x2019; at 70.4); Q&#x2019;s reading here also has its overt defenders, not least of which is Randall McLeod, that doughty champion of unediting.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_10"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
<p>Most editors, however, follow Capell and regard this line in Sonnet 129 as an example of compositorial error, on the grounds that its string of adjectival phrases disrupts the syntactical structure that has been building up in the
<target target-type="page" id="page_213"/>preceding lines, in which there is a strong sense of pursuit and possession being framed as distinct and even contrasting stages of the experience of sexual encounter:
<disp-quote>
<p>Inioyd no sooner but dispised straight, [5]</p>
<p>Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
<p>[. . .]</p>
<p>Made In pursut and in possession so,
<p>Had, hauing, and in quest, to haue extreme, [10]</p>
<p>All of these lines (bar l. 10) also break into a bipartite structure, depicting the emotional state &#x2018;before&#x2019; and &#x2018;after&#x2019; intercourse, as does l. 12: &#x2018;Before, a joy proposd behind a dreame&#x2019;. Emending editors therefore argue that the compositor must have misread his copy, mistaking &#x2018;a&#x2019; for an ampersand (a frequent manuscript brevigraph, in fair copies as well as drafts), and, expanding accordingly, consequently failed to supply the apostrophe that would have clarified that Q&#x2019;s &#x2018;proud&#x2019; was an elision (&#x2018;prou&#x2019;d&#x2019;) and that &#x2018;u&#x2019; should therefore be read as &#x2018;v&#x2019; (as was standard when the letter occurrs in a medial position, as here). The absence of an apostrophe offers no evidence either way as to the reading of Q&#x2019;s &#x2018;proud&#x2019;: while the apostrophe is often used in Q to signal elision (see Q&#x2019;s spelling of &#x2018;proved&#x2019; as &#x2018;prou&#x2019;d&#x2019; at 110.8), this practice is not consistent across the volume, and in this sonnet not one of the other four elisions (&#x2018;periurd&#x2019;, &#x2018;murdrous&#x2019;, &#x2018;inioyd&#x2019;, &#x2018;proposd&#x2019;, ll. 3, 5, 12) is indicated by an apostrophe. Q&#x2019;s (and Benson&#x2019;s) &#x2018;A blisse in proofe and proud and very wo&#x2019; can thus become, in modernised spelling and punctuation, &#x2018;A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe&#x2019;, producing a bipartite line that parallels the structure of the one that follows.</p>
<p>The crux in Sonnet 129 has been in the public domain since Malone&#x2019;s 1780 supplement to the Johnson-Steevens edition of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_11"><sup>11</sup></xref> An indication of how easy it can be for a potential error to slip under the editorial radar is provided by the following example from Sonnet 46, which did not feature in the editorial tradition until Katherine Duncan-Jones picked up on a 2008 suggestion made by Paul Hammond when revising her Arden edition of the <italic>Sonnets</italic> for republication in 2010.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_12"><sup>12</sup></xref> Previous to this, editors were frequently perplexed by ll. 9&#x2013;10 (&#x2018;To side this title is impanelled/ A quest [i.e. jury] of thoughts&#x2019;, sig. D2v), because of the oddity of the verb &#x2018;side&#x2019; in this context. The <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic> cites these lines as the only instance of the meaning &#x2018;to assign to one of two sides or parties&#x2019; (&#x2018;side, v. 1&#x2019;, sense 5). The evidence for this meaning is consequently rather thin: the nearest parallel in Shakespeare to such a usage would be <italic>Coriolanus</italic> (&#x2018;They&#x2019;ll sit by th&#x2019; fire, and presume to know/ What&#x2019;s done i&#x2019; th&#x2019; Capitol [. . .] side factions, and give out/ Conjectural marriages&#x2019;, 1.1.191&#x2013;4), where &#x2018;side&#x2019; would seem to indicate &#x2018;to support or countenance&#x2019; (<ITALIC>OED</ITALIC>, sense 3). Most modern editors therefore follow Malone (following Capell) and emend &#x2018;side&#x2019; to &#x2018;&#x2019;cide&#x2019; (i.e. decide), on the grounds that (i) &#x2018;deside&#x2019; was an acceptable early modern spelling of &#x2018;decide&#x2019;, and (ii) Shakespeare frequently coins aphetic forms.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_13"><sup>13</sup></xref> However, Hammond points out that Q&#x2019;s &#x2018;side&#x2019; could instead be a misreading of &#x2018;finde&#x2019;: &#x2018;f&#x2019; and the
<target target-type="page" id="page_214"/>long &#x2018;s&#x2019; are readily mistaken for each other in secretary hand, and it is similarly easy to miss the tilde over a vowel that is often used to supply &#x2018;n&#x2019; or &#x2018;m&#x2019; (the same error with a tilde seems to have been made at Sonnet 77.10, where Q&#x2019;s &#x2018;waste blacks&#x2019; should rather read &#x2018;blancks&#x2019;, i.e. blanks, sig. F1r). &#x2018;Find&#x2019; in the context of Sonnet 46 would thus mean &#x2018;determine and declare&#x2019; a verdict (OED, sense 17b), fitting the legal vocabulary of this sonnet, which frames the poet-speaker&#x2019;s heart and eye as plaintiff and defendant in a court of law. The case for emendation is further strengthened by two other bits of evidence assembled elsewhere by Hammond, namely parallel usages of &#x2018;find&#x2019; at 92.11 (&#x2018;Oh what a happy title do I find&#x2019;) and in the first of the &#x2018;Certain Sonnets&#x2019; in Richard Barnfield&#x2019;s <italic>Cynthia</italic> volume (1595), a poem which is also constructed around the conceit of the lover&#x2019;s eyes being put on trial and which may have been an influence on Sonnet 46: &#x2018;Conscience the Iudge, twelue Reasons are the Iurie,/ They finde mine eies the beutie t&#x2019;haue let in&#x2019; (ll. 9&#x2013;10).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_14"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
<p>While the examples hitherto have concentrated on diction, the potentially insidious effect of editorial intervention is still more striking if we look at changes to punctuation, particularly as these modifications (to &#x2018;accidentals&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;substantives&#x2019;) are often made completely silently, despite the fact that &#x2013; in many instances &#x2013; they can drastically alter the meaning of the text. Take, for example, the editorial habit of changing some of Q&#x2019;s question marks to exclamation marks, on the grounds that the question mark could still serve a double function in this period. It is a seemingly small change, but one that fundamentally alters the nature of the communication. An exclamation can be a solitary (if slightly histrionic) utterance. A question presupposes someone listening. Sonnets are often seen as a very introspective genre, in which the tortured lover solipsistically examines their own emotions. However, sonnets are frequently much more outward-looking than this suggests. Admittedly, their poet-lovers tend to dwell obsessively on their own inner states, but as they do so, they are almost always in communication with their audience, be it the primary audience of the beloved, whom they are hoping to persuade, or a wider audience of readers (whom they are intending to move and impress). Petrarch&#x2019;s <italic>Rime Sparse</italic>, for example, looms large over the Renaissance sonnet tradition. As a work, it might spend a considerable amount of time pondering the poet-speaker&#x2019;s inner turmoil, but it does so in poems which are addressed to others: to patrons (such as Orso dell&#x2019;Anguillara or Stefano Colonna), to fellow-poets (such as Andrea Stramazzo or Sennuccio del Bene), to Laura herself, or to us as readers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_15"><sup>15</sup></xref> The sequence even opens with the word &#x2018;Voi&#x2019;, directly addressing its readers with a plural &#x2018;you&#x2019;. So too, of Shakespeare&#x2019;s 154 sonnets, over 130 use linguistic features such as second-person pronouns or the use of imperatives to embed a sense of an audience that is being directly addressed.</p>
<p>Since there were exclamation marks in the compositor&#x2019;s boxes in George Eld&#x2019;s print-shop, where Q was set, changing question marks to exclamation marks is also unnecessary and could thus be classed as one of Gaskell&#x2019;s &#x2018;deliberate but unauthorized alterations&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_16"><sup>16</sup></xref> Nonetheless, at least four of the major scholarly editions prepared in the latter part of twentieth century &#x2013; Stephen Booth&#x2019;s (Yale University Press, 1977), John Kerrigan&#x2019;s (Penguin, 1986), Ingram and Redpath&#x2019;s, and Blakemore Evans&#x2019;s &#x2013; make this alteration
<target target-type="page" id="page_215"/>at various points. Booth admittedly does so with a facsimile on the facing page; Blakemore Evans notes the alteration at the bottom of the page; Kerrigan, and Ingram and Redpath, however, make no mention of it whatsoever. This is a change, moreover, which silently changes the texture of the poetry, and helps compound a dominant critical narrative about the sonnet genre (namely, its introspection as opposed to its potential performativity and extroversion).</p>
<p>A similar silence is drawn over changes to the punctuation in Sonnet 29, lines 9&#x2013;12 of which in Q read:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yet in these thoughts my selfe almost despising, Haplye I thinke on thee, and then my state, [10] (Like to the Larke at breake of day arising) From sullen earth sings himns at Heauens gate,
<p>(sig. C3r)</p>
<p>All four of the editors cited above alter this so that the parenthetical com -ment extends over the line break and ends after &#x2018;earth&#x2019; (l. 12). That decision rewrites the meaning of those lines. In Q, the poet-speaker remains earthbound, but is empowered &#x2013; through his love &#x2013; to sing hymns which aspire to reach to heaven; in the emended version, it is the lark that leaves the &#x2018;sullen earth&#x2019;: the position of one curved line makes a great deal of difference to the sense. Allowing the lark to rise over the end of the line with the enjambment is a nice moment of poetry, but does that justify moving the bracket? Q makes sense. We know for sure that is what early readers would have read, whereas we do not know that Shakespeare did not place a bracket at the end of l. 11 (compositors are unlikely to add brackets which are not there in the copy-text, although it is not unusual for manuscripts to contain examples of opening brackets missing their closing pair). As with the example of &#x2018;eyes&#x2019;/&#x2018;brow&#x2019; in Sonnet 127, we risk replacing a certainty with an uncertainty if we intervene.</p>
<p>Editing can thus be an insidious form of argument, because so many of the decisions are taken unobtrusively, working on readers without them ever realising it. These changes might have an aesthetic effect, but they can also be political, as can be seen with the treatment of lineation in Shakespeare&#x2019;s <italic>Coriolanus</italic>, written c. 1607&#x2013;8, but only printed posthumously, in the 1623 Folio (F). Shakespeare&#x2019;s late style frequently tests the boundaries of the iambic pentameter line, and <italic>Coriolanus</italic> &#x2013; like other plays of this period &#x2013; has lines which run to twelve syllables, have feminine endings, rely on clipped or syncopated forms, or allow the syntax to strain against the lineation (as when lines end with a word such as &#x2018;and&#x2019; or &#x2018;but&#x2019;). There are also a number of short-line exchanges where it is unclear whether verse or prose is intended, and the same characters can slip between prose and verse within the same scene (Virgilia and Volumnia in 1.3, Menenius and the Watchmen in 5.2 to name but two examples).</p>
<p>Some of these problems may arise from the manuscript lying behind <italic>Coriolanus</italic>. If Shakespeare was Hand D in the manuscript of <italic>Sir Thomas More</italic>, then the authorial manuscript would have contributed to the confusion regarding lineation: Hand D (like many hands trained in the mid-sixteenth
<target target-type="page" id="page_216"/>century) does not automatically capitalise the initial letter in a line of verse; it also crams over-running lines into the preceding line, to save space. Unclear lineation in the manuscript of <italic>Coriolanus</italic> would then have been exacerbated during the printing process, with the need to squeeze the often long lines of the play into two columns in F, particularly problematic where the line includes &#x2013; and is therefore extended by &#x2013; a speech prefix.</p>
<p>However, it is also probable that some of the shifts between verse and prose in <italic>Coriolanus</italic> are deliberate. Politics in <italic>Coriolanus</italic>&#x2019;s Rome is explicitly connected to verbal power (the election of the consul depends on the giving or withholding of the citizens&#x2019; &#x2018;voices&#x2019;), and in the play &#x2013; as is customary in Renaissance drama &#x2013; speaking verse denotes and confers a certain social status. Lineation &#x2013; which distinguishes verse and prose &#x2013; is thus political and, poten -tially, as much a site of contestation as the granaries to which the hungry citizens want access in the opening scene. Take the following speech from 1.1, which &#x2013; in F &#x2013; is lineated as verse:
<disp-quote>
<p>2 Citizen.</p>
<p>Well,
<p>Ile hear it Sir: yet you must not thinke
<p>To fobbe off our disgrace with a tale:
<disp-quote>
<p>But and&#x2019;t please you deliuer.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_17"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
<p>F&#x2019;s compositors are not necessarily reliable when it comes to lineation and the meter here is certainly not classifiable as regular iambic pentameter; as a result, most editors choose to render this speech as prose. However, the second citizen has ambitions to speak in verse, just like the patrician Menenius, and it is therefore possible to follow F and to read this speech as the citizen starting to reach for the blank verse which he achieves more confidently in his next lengthy interjection (1.1.114&#x2013;19). Rendering the citizen&#x2019;s speech in prose could be seen as a means of keeping the citizen, and those of his class, in their place, defining them as &#x2018;plebeian&#x2019;, a label &#x2013; employed elsewhere in the play &#x2013; which emphasises their lowly social status in contrast to the enfranchised role they have as citizens, just as in 2.3, the shifting stage directions and speech prefixes reflect the moments at which the &#x2018;citizens&#x2019; relinquish their agency and abandon their civic duty as they first allow themselves to be manipulated by the tribunes, and then (as &#x2018;rabble of plebeians&#x2019;) resort to mob violence (sig. 2B2r).</p>
<p>The editorial reluctance to trust F&#x2019;s versification in relation to the Second Citizen at this juncture contrasts markedly with the moment in 2.2 where Menenius is nettled by the tribunes&#x2019; refusal to endorse Martius&#x2019; election. In F, the subsequent exchange is laid out in prose (2A6r); the editorial tradition, attuned to associating verse with the social elite, habitually reframes this as verse:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Sic[inius]</italic> We are convented
<p>Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts Inclinable to honor and advance The theme of our assembly.</p>
<target target-type="page" id="page_217"/>
<p><italic>Bru[tus]</italic> Which the rather
<p>We shall be blest to do, if he remember
<p>A kinder value of the people than
<p>He hath hereto priz&#x2019;d them at. <italic>Men[enius]</italic> That&#x2019;s off, that&#x2019;s off;</p>
<p>I would you rather had been silent. Please you
<p>To hear Cominius speak?</p>
<p>Bru. Most willingly;</p>
<p>But yet my caution was more pertinent
<p>Than the rebuke you give it.</p>
<p>Men. He loves your people,
<p>But tie him not to be their bedfellow.</p>
<p>(2.2.54&#x2013;65)</p>
<p>The lines do indeed reassemble quite naturally into iambic pentameter and perhaps F&#x2019;s prose was an &#x2018;error&#x2019; that needed correcting, but it is notable that it is much more conventional to facilitate the iambic pentameter of the play&#x2019;s political elite than to allow a citizen to fumble into verse.</p>
<p>This case study, based on some of the dilemmas that I encountered while editing <italic>Coriolanus</italic> and the <italic>Sonnets</italic>, shows how even seemingly small decisions &#x2013; the insertion, or removal, of a line break; the placing of a closing bracket (what Gaskell would have classed as an &#x2018;accidental&#x2019;) &#x2013; can impact on a reader&#x2019;s understanding and experience of the text. When editing, we need to be aware of our own partiality (be it aesthetic or political) and &#x2013; as necessary &#x2013; to guard against it. Nevertheless, however much we try, editing can never be entirely objective: it is an argument, and as teachers, editors and scholars, we need to train readers to be aware of the sometimes surreptitious ways in which texts are shaped by the editorial process.</p>

<title>On mess</title>
<p><italic>Kate Bennett</italic></p>
<p>In the new Oxford edition of John Aubrey&#x2019;s <italic>Brief Lives</italic> I argued a revisionist case against an editorial tradition which treats the material texts of the <italic>Lives</italic> with some contempt, while finding their insights irresistible. Arguments for Aubrey&#x2019;s place in the intellectual world of the seventeenth century have largely avoided his greatest work, focusing attention instead on his scientific and topographical writings. The implicit suggestion is that &#x2018;serious&#x2019; Aubrey and the Aubrey of <italic>Brief Lives</italic> are two different entities. My 2015 Oxford edition showed that Aubrey was not, as has previously been asserted, a research assistant to the Oxford antiquary and biographer Anthony Wood, one who
<target target-type="page" id="page_218"/>picked up stray gossip; but a vigorously proactive collaborative author whose intellectual and social network was deliberately cultivated and &#x2018;worked&#x2019;. Aubrey had the reputation of a human newspaper, dubbed &#x2018;Mercurius Politicus&#x2019;, by a contemporary; he was both skilled and persistent in pursuing his information.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_18"><sup>18</sup></xref> I designed the textual approach, Introduction, and Com -mentary of the edition to work together to make this argument, and to address the related question of Aubrey&#x2019;s reliability as a witness. Joe Moshenska (2.4.3) eloquently speaks of Digby&#x2019;s letters as displaying &#x2018;a spiral of unfolding thought&#x2019;. The new edition addresses Aubrey&#x2019;s more socialised, but equally self-conscious, monument of unfolding intellectual activity (ques tions being posed, tips exchanged, information coming in and qualifying other information) and through its introduction and commentary, seeks to motivate readers to locate that activity in a richly informed context. In what follows I will explain how the presentation of the text was central to this argument.</p>
<p>When I first began to edit <italic>Brief Lives</italic> I did not know what I was going to do with my new project. There were a handful of popular editions and one scholarly edition of 1898, by Andrew Clark.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_19"><sup>19</sup></xref> This is bowdlerised, incomplete, and heavily reordered; it also lacks an Introduction, Commentary, and important textual information, such as deleted material. However I made use of it in several ways. Clark was an excellent palaeographer, and his edition preserved a number of readings, such as the full title, which have subsequently disappeared as the <italic>Brief Lives</italic> manuscripts have over time sustained damage. At a later stage I checked my text against his, although I did not actually collate the two texts as they were so different. This gave me a second opinion on diffi -cult readings and in some cases of damage provided these readings, although I also used some earlier manuscript sources which I discovered in the course of my research. Clark provided a very brief textual introduction, in which he identified some key editorial questions, and a handful of notes, some of which were very valuable. However, Clark&#x2019;s text was based on a broader range of sources than the <italic>Lives</italic> manuscripts proper. He included a range of biographical material such as extracts from Aubrey&#x2019;s letters, his draft play, and an astrological manuscript, which were woven into the text of <italic>Brief Lives</italic>, making a confusing composite text. Very few of Aubrey&#x2019;s many manuscripts had been edited, perhaps because many of them are as textually complicated as <italic>Brief Lives</italic>, with which they overlap significantly. This overlap meant I had to anticipate the nature of future editions; most importantly, I decided that the life of Thomas Hobbes ought to be a separate volume, and that the biographical correspondence should also be considered as distinct from the text of the <italic>Lives</italic>.</p>
<p>This combination of factors meant I was not able to guess how large the project was, or how long it would take, how many pages of edited text there would be, or what the Commentary might look like. I did not appreciate how selective the existing publications were, and I had no more than a sense that there might be some more books and papers to be found. However, there was a biography by Anthony Powell, which gave a basic chronology, and a useful if incomplete list of Aubrey&#x2019;s library, which showed that material in the <italic>Lives</italic> was also found as annotations in his books, something which proved to be an
<target target-type="page" id="page_219"/>important insight.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_20"><sup>20</sup></xref> There was an excellent general scholarly study of Aubrey by Michael Hunter which outlined many of the intellectual contexts in which the <italic>Lives</italic> might be placed, identified a wide range of dispersed papers and indicated which archives I could expect to be using.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_21"><sup>21</sup></xref> This is vitally important when undertaking manuscript and archival work: a single visit will often not be sufficient, and even with archives close to home, ordering, and funding, copies of manuscripts may be necessary. I used photocopies of my texts at all times, not my edited drafts. This proved to be a good practice.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Andrew Clark had provided a meticulous biographical index. I began by transcribing it and used it for the duration of the project as a basis of what became my commentary. It was essential to have a structure right from the beginning which was both reliable and simple, to give the work an empirical basis. However, in retrospect, it did skew my thinking by ordering my work according to persons rather than places, chronologies, or intellectual categories; and I missed some patterns which only emerged at the end of the project when I checked my major sources for the last time (and as a reward for this tedium corrected an amazing number of minor errors). Initially, I checked each item in the index against the corresponding page in the edition, which gave me the essential manuscript sources, and was thus able to make a preliminary biographical index of the manuscript text. This then allowed me to decide what should constitute my text and how that text should be arranged. I was not sure whether to follow my editorial predecessors who had reordered the text. Certainly this would make things much more convenient for a reader who has no particular interest in life writing, nor in Aubrey, nor in seventeenth-century networks of informa tion but who essentially wants to know what Aubrey says about Sir Kenelm Digby or Richard Corbett; all the parts can be assembled from the various volumes; material in the margins or out of chronological sequence can be seen together. A spin-off later edition, such as World&#x2019;s Classics, would be much easier to prepare. However, as I began to understand the composition of the manuscripts, I realised that there was no single satisfactory way of editing them, and that taking the manuscripts themselves in their current order was the best principle for the edition. &#x2018;I resolved to design my own editorial conventions from scratch and, as Valerie Rumbold (2.1.4) recom mends in her discussion of Swift, to present in the text, introduction, and commentary &#x2018;a longer, more accessible account&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;a miracle of compaction from which the untrained eye recoils&#x2019;. I wanted to attract readers to the messy text, not shield them from it.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that Aubrey&#x2019;s life has often been represented as a rake&#x2019;s progress witnessed in the material form of his manuscripts: they have been described as drunken &#x2018;hiccups&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_22"><sup>22</sup></xref> Preposterous and glib though this view is, it is also prevalent and destructive. Thus I was anxious to attend to the material form of the manuscripts with special care to construct from them an accurate narrative unbiased by biographical legend which would also address the related question of his &#x2018;reliability&#x2019; as a witness. It is true that Aubrey lost his fortune. He was born a country gentleman, heir to the Wiltshire manor of Easton Piercy and other estates. But during the period of composition of <italic>Brief Lives</italic> he was a bankrupt with no settled home and no single place to keep his books, his
<target target-type="page" id="page_220"/>correspondence, or his own manuscripts. It may surprise new readers of his works to know that the <italic>Brief Lives</italic> manuscripts were never kept together in Aubrey&#x2019;s possession as a complete set. Indeed, they are not complete now, because forty-four pages were removed from the second volume and destroyed without Aubrey&#x2019;s knowledge or consent by his biographical collaborator, Anthony Wood. Other pages were deliberately removed, probably by Aubrey himself, because they contained scandal. Aubrey called <italic>Brief Lives</italic> &#x2018;a booke of Secrets and reflections concerning so many great persons still alive&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_23"><sup>23</sup></xref> Highly sensitive to the delicate nature of their contents, he exercised considerable skill in circulating his manuscripts and gathering data for them, while attempting to ensure they survived to posterity. The manuscript form of the works and his prudent choice of archival sanctuary were essential to their survival. The <italic>Lives</italic> were not expected or intended to appear in print either in full or in Aubrey&#x2019;s lifetime: instead, he placed them in the Ashmolean Museum for safe-keeping; and even there they did not survive unscathed.</p>
<p>The surviving texts of the <italic>Lives</italic> are preserved in three manuscript volumes, Bodleian Library MSS Aubrey 6&#x2013;8. Bod. MS Aubrey 6 contains the greatest number of fair-copy lives, but most are in some degree inchoate, containing many spaces and gaps for information whose discovery Aubrey wished to signal both as absent and also as desirable. These lacunae are what Collier termed &#x2018;hiccups&#x2019;, but I interpret them as a visual demonstration of Aubrey&#x2019;s commit -ment to developing a culture of fact. Some additional information is entered in the margins or between the lines. Much more supplementary material is found in Bod. MS Aubrey 8, several pages of which bear brief biographical comments, full additional paragraphs, which sometimes repeat material in the first volume, and related material such as printed papers and portraits. Some of these notes in Aubrey 8 may be preliminary researches for lives which were either destroyed or never developed further. Some appear to be additions to destroyed lives. Still others are intended as con tributions to collaborative works: addenda to information communicated by letter, or corrections to pub -lished books. The three manuscripts contain over 160 illustrations, architec -tural drawings, escutcheons, and horoscopes. In addition they contain letters, wax seals, printed pamphlets, and notes which were pasted or pinned into the manuscripts, and are annotated with an idiosyncratic system of symbols.</p>
<p>As you may imagine, all this creates a highly distinctive, yet untidy page. Andrew Clark, editor of the 1898 Clarendon Press edition of <italic>Brief Lives</italic>, deplored the &#x2018;frequent erasures, repetitions, half-made or inconsistent cor -rections&#x2019; and longed to edit &#x2018;a smooth text&#x2019; which might &#x2018;spare the reader much irritation&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_24"><sup>24</sup></xref> Clark&#x2019;s wish to spare the reader has led to a legacy of mis representation. <italic>Brief Lives</italic> has traditionally been edited as if the destruction of portions of the manuscripts had never happened, as if Aubrey were not a collaborative writer, and as if the manuscripts did not contain other, non-biographical, types of material. Clark did create an appendix of &#x2018;Notes of Antiquities&#x2019;, but chose to present <italic>Brief Lives</italic>, including its non-biographical content (such as a letter from a farmer negotiating the purchase of sheep), as an alphabetically ordered biographical dictionary.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_25"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_221"/>Since Clark, and until now, all editors have imposed order on the <italic>Lives</italic> to produce a spuriously coherent, regularised, alphabetically ordered text. The misunderstandings this created may be illustrated by one example. In Oliver Lawson Dick&#x2019;s popular edition of 1949, Dick claimed that the &#x2018;lives&#x2019; Aubrey wrote vary in length from &#x2018;two words&#x2019; to &#x2018;twenty-three thousand&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_26"><sup>26</sup></xref> The supposed &#x2018;two word&#x2019; life is in fact Aubrey&#x2019;s memorandum, found in his index to <italic>Brief Lives</italic>, of Bishop Seth Ward&#x2019;s view that Abraham Wheelocke was a &#x2018;simple man&#x2019; for publishing his Calvinistic notes in his 1643 edition of Bede&#x2019;s <italic>Historiae Ecclesiasticae Gentis Anglorum</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_27"><sup>27</sup></xref> Clark erroneously published this as a single biographical entry.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_28"><sup>28</sup></xref> The Wheelocke two-word &#x2018;life&#x2019; has come to define <italic>Brief Lives</italic>. Between 2013 and 2015, it has been picked out with faint scorn in a <ITALIC>TLS</ITALIC> review, in an account of medieval Arabic biography, a literary encyclopaedia, and a dictionary of life writing.</p>
<p>To offer a revisionist view of the text I typeset the volumes myself, using a version of the computer-typesetting program TeX created for the purpose. Doing so allowed me first of all to understand, and then to represent, the material characteristics of the text for the first time in the editorial tradition. TeX incorporates a general-purpose programming language, which means that if the user wants a feature, and is able to write the code, they can have more or less anything they choose. When I first began to work on the <italic>Lives</italic> manuscripts, I was amazed by their difference from the printed editions which I had assumed would guide my practice to some extent. I was not sure how to transcribe them, and certainly had no real idea how they might be represented in print. But TeX allows the potential for descriptive mark-up, which allowed me to transcribe and analyse the manuscripts without com -mitting me irrevocably to features in the printed work which might have proved to be distracting clutter. For example, in the so-called plain version of the program, if you want a word to appear in boldface, you define the word in this way {\bf word}. I used this feature to make several definitions which were descriptive of features of the manuscript. For example, the <italic>Lives</italic> manuscripts contain several different hands, identified in transcription as {\Malone word}, {\Bliss word}, {\Wood word}, or {\unidentified word} and so on. Having noted all such instances, I then had the freedom to define all of these different names centrally as equivalent to a single font; or to distinguish between them. In the end I found that only two hands appeared on the same page at any time and so I used only two fonts, boldface for Wood&#x2019;s hand and slanting boldface for everyone else. Using another central definition (\let\Malone=\relax) I could tell the program to ignore the mark-up &#x2013; useful for the thousand or so instances of {\crossreferencethis}. The transcription process could thus be, as it needed to be with such a chaotic manuscript, descriptive of the text; while the next process, to decide how much detail should be recorded in print and how it should be represented, could wait until I had sufficient information to make a sound judgement. At this point I could show draft pages to my publisher and others to draw on their expertise and address their house style.</p>
<p>Editing prose, especially complicated, messy prose, is more arduous than editing poetry in one significant respect. With poetry, you know where the line
<target target-type="page" id="page_222"/>endings will fall; with prose, these change every time the width of the edited text is altered. Such alterations are inevitable: complex manuscripts yield their secrets over time, while their transcriptions evolve into edited form through gradual experiment. For example, initially I expected to put everything in the margin of the manuscript in the corresponding position in the edited text, but soon found that this was not possible. I instead distinguished material which had to be in the margin, perhaps because it commented on the text, or the text contained the phrase &#x2018;as in the margent&#x2019;, from material which could be edited as part of the main text. In the latter case I added a note in the critical apparatus to explain what had been done. Many of these distinctions were not clear-cut, and needed to be made late in the project, as part of the compositional process. Marginal notes rely on juxtaposition, so the need to put notes against the line on which they comment took priority, and I had to move some others to make room. These were editorial decisions which could not possibly have been made by the typesetter because they arose in response to the unpredictable accidents of pagination. On the printed page they might print out below the footline, or on the wrong page. They might need to be moved up or down the margin, over to the following page, or be printed in the main text, processes which might require a new note in the a<italic>pparatus criticus</italic> and possibly also a new lemma in the Commentary. The images and the pedigrees arrived late in the project from a picture-editor and changed the pagination, as the spaces I had left to accommodate them proved too small for their detail to be seen; and because the coats of arms, which appear in the margin, frequently obliterated marginal notes. Interlineations produced similar problems, as you will readily appreciate. Multiple changes were an essential process in converting research material into a publishable work and ensuring its consistency and quality. Final drafting is especially important in a big edition, since it has so many dimensions and takes so much time; but sometimes it is difficult to accomplish. My ability to do this improved the consistency and quality of the edition significantly. Most importantly of all, it was possible to judge whether a feature worked in practice, whether it looked right and was intuitively easy to interpret, to seek the advice of publishing professionals and colleagues, and to improve the text accordingly until it looked as good as I could make it. It was a labour of love: I chose a version of Baskerville as the font of the main text, and then found that the manicule appeared with a modern business suit cuff. I replaced it with a dashing seventeenth-century manicule with a lace cuff which I found among the Fell types. Every time a change was made to the text, the program could instantly reformat the entire edition, and I could then check that no new problems had been introduced, such as bad line-breaks or new errors. This is a world away from giving a Word file to a typesetter, receiving proofs, editing those proofs, and then finding that a myriad of further problems have been introduced as an innocent consequence of trying to carry out the editor&#x2019;s instruc tions, and now cannot easily be amended. A typesetting program such as Quark Express would allow any editor to do this. There is also a version of the TeX program specifically designed for critical editions, called EdMac, which comes with its own manual and has been used by OUP editors to produce camera-ready copy.</p>

<p>Bodleian Library, Oxford, MS Aubrey 6, fol. 39r
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_224"/>What was the point of all this labour? The <italic>Lives</italic> manuscripts turned out to be, just as I had expected, no feckless mess but rather the material form of a social and intellectual process. Staying true to that form in the text allowed me to construct a detailed accompanying narrative of context and composition in the Introduction and Commentary. Aubrey&#x2019;s texts use their <italic>mise-en-page</italic> partly as a way of framing the life, but they also reveal much about Aubrey&#x2019;s process of conducting research. The life of the mathematician William Oughtred is typical.</p>
<p>It has a horoscope around which the text is written, and a coat of arms in the margin. It begins, therefore, both chronologically and thematic ally. We are being instructed to think of Oughtred&#x2019;s birth in terms of the dignity of family lineage, and also as an object of study for astrologers. The horoscope has the date and time of Oughtred&#x2019;s nativity, but is otherwise incomplete: it lacks the planetary signs. In the margin there is a memorandum to ask Elias Ashmole &#x2018;for his Nativity&#x2019;; the same note in the text is crossed out; Ashmole did not have the necessary information. In the margin is a note to consult an unidentified printed life, where the space for the title is marked out by a series of points. There are other places in this life where such points are used in this way: here they are simply standing in for names which Aubrey does not know, but in other parts of the manuscript they are far more extensive and map out whole stretches of territory: missing bibliographies, for example, or accounts of the subject&#x2019;s childhood. Tipped into Oughtred&#x2019;s life is a letter in his autograph. This supports a factual claim made in the life; but it has other functions. It illustrates a passage in the life, which describes how Oughtred, the son of a writing-master, could not bear his mathematical pupils to write a bad hand but insisted on teaching them better ways; his own hand was &#x2018;very elegant&#x2019;, and his astrological &#x2018;schemes&#x2019; appeared to have been &#x2018;cut in copper&#x2019;. It serves as an exemplum of Oughtred&#x2019;s handwriting, to facilitate the iden tification of further manuscripts, as well as acting as a souvenir, a relic of the great man.</p>
<p>As I sat down to edit the <italic>Lives</italic> I was faced with this dilemma: Aubrey did not expect his own work to be printed. As the Oughtred letter and the deliberate spaces demonstrate, his work is profoundly embedded in manuscript culture, seeking out both matter and a form which cannot easily be translated into print. Where does this leave the editor? Must a printed edition of <italic>Brief Lives</italic> work in every respect against the very nature of the text it seeks to represent? From his antiquarian immersion, Aubrey was attempting to make true manuscripts, to &#x2018;propagate Trueth&#x2019; as he puts it, a phrase he uses to describe the placing of Hobbes&#x2019;s essay on heresy in the manuscript of the life of Hobbes. But he and his circle were also working to change the form of the printed book so that it could reflect the state of the world of knowledge, just as he felt the spaces in his manuscripts did. Aubrey had an antiquarian aversion to using rhetoric to satisfy a reader&#x2019;s sense of completeness, to tickle &#x2018;his eares with Elogies&#x2019; while leaving &#x2018;him ignorant&#x2019; of genealogical and other facts. Aubrey used spaces to signal ignorance as well as, more practically, to accom -modate information he hoped would be found.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_29"><sup>29</sup></xref> Abraham Hill&#x2019;s biographical preface to Tillotson&#x2019;s collected works of Isaac Barrow was written in collab -</p>
<target target-type="page" id="page_225"/>oration with Aubrey. In two places in this biography, Hill printed a space where he did not have the necessary information. For example, there was disagree -ment among Barrow&#x2019;s family as to his date of birth, so the text reads: &#x2018;He was born in London October 1630&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_30"><sup>30</sup></xref></p>
<p>Looking to another source for Aubrey&#x2019;s inspiration for innovative pre -sentation: Aubrey gained a sense of how to present horoscopes in <italic>Brief Lives</italic> from Elias Ashmole&#x2019;s biographical appendix to his alchemical collection, <italic>Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum</italic> (1652). Aubrey admired the book and invested much time in attempting to persuade Ashmole to bring out a second volume, and in pursuing rumours of further alchemical manuscripts which might be published therein. One of these alchemical manuscripts, allegedly discovered in &#x2018;an old wall&#x2019; in Somerset, is found in <italic>Brief Lives</italic>. Ashmole proclaims that Edward Kelly&#x2019;s &#x2018;Nativity (graved from the Original Calculation of Doctor Dee and under his hand) I here Exhibite&#x2019;. His association between <italic>engraving</italic> and <italic>exhibiting</italic> is highly sig nificant. He is seeking the quality of a facsimile for Kelly&#x2019;s nativity and has tried to make the horoscope look like a manuscript: the engraver has used a very cursive hand. John Gadbury&#x2019;s <italic>Collectio Geniturarum</italic>, which Aubrey knew well and whose title he borrowed for his own astrological collection, does not distinguish the <italic>font</italic> of the horo -scope from that of the text, nor does Gadbury refer to his source. Ashmole does however; he means to demonstrate, not only that his source is of the best quality, but also that he is describing a manuscript in his personal possession.</p>
<p>Aubrey&#x2019;s own texts offer just such privileged confidences, presenting them -selves as things to be exhibited, but only to a select audience. Antiquarianism is a matter as much of showing and telling as of reading. Reading Aubrey&#x2019;s <italic>Lives</italic> is often to hear the author guiding you through the material content of his manuscripts: pointing out things &#x2018;in the margent&#x2019;, explaining that an inserted paper or a comment in the text is in the handwriting of the biographical subject, or simply wishing that the biographical subject had written more clearly and used a little more paper. Respecting the appearance of the manuscript in the edition helps to make this clear. Most dramatically, when we open Bod. MS Aubrey 7, we meet a cry of outrage: a paper, complaining of Wood&#x2019;s destruction of the text, headed &#x2018;Ingratitude!&#x2019; I have for the first time edited this paper as it is found in the manuscript, the second item in volume 2.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_31"><sup>31</sup></xref> When Edmond Malone discovered the manuscript in the 1790s and read this paper he was appalled; moved, he sought to repair the damage by finding some of the many stray Aubrey papers among Wood&#x2019;s collections, which were also in the Ashmolean, and putting them in the mutilated volume. Thus the second volume of <italic>Brief Lives</italic> as we have it today is partly Malone&#x2019;s creation.</p>
<p>This fact is irreversible: we simply cannot be sure what Malone introduced to the manuscript volumes from other sources. My edition addresses a textual heritage as it is manifested in the physical manuscript now, rather than seeking to restore a &#x2018;text&#x2019; to a single point in its long history. Between the life of Sir Edward Coke and that of the mathematician Sir Charles Cavendish is a stub of a page which has been cut from the manuscript, and is quite hard to see at all. This was the life of Richard Boyle, first Earl of Cork, who made a vast
<target target-type="page" id="page_226"/>fortune by corrupt administration of Irish lands. His <italic>Life</italic> must have been a long and detailed one, and Aubrey says it was highly indiscreet. On the other side are parts of the marginal notes and half of a coat of arms. I chose to present the text found on the stub, which has never before been transcribed, not as matter in an appendix, nor in the chapter on the &#x2018;Excised Lives&#x2019;, but as part of the text in the form of an opening. Turning the page the excessive proportion

<p>of white space might panic a reader; it looks odd: did something perhaps go wrong in the printing process? The absent text is extremely conspicuous. It turns some thing almost imperceptible into a statement which is impossible to overlook; its fragments stand for many which I could not edit at all.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_32"><sup>32</sup></xref></p>
<p>For scholarly editions, the design of the volume is part of the editorial task, but the editor may be hampered in fulfilling it. Not many editors will be willing to typeset their own edition, and the publisher simply may not allow it. Addressing the material form of the text is extremely difficult to combine with the usual processes of submission of manuscript, typesetting, copy-editing, and proof-correction. There are good reasons why publishers establish, and maintain, the style of their series: it is efficient, has inbuilt quality control, all those involved with production of the book understand what they must do, and it maintains brand values for the series. These reasons may require an editor to argue even for simple design decisions at a meeting with her/his publisher, such as selecting a neo-Renaissance font like Bembo in preference to a modern sans-serif font. But it is worthwhile for editors to make these arguments, because editors know their texts, their students, and their colleagues better than their publishers do; publishers are not unreasonable people. Recently I partici -pated in a study of <italic>Oxford Scholarship Online</italic>, in which I was asked whether a print-out of a pdf of the electronic form of a book chapter, itself a technical work in progress, had allowed me to &#x2018;extract&#x2019; all the &#x2018;information&#x2019; I needed from the work. My answer was that it had not; it had been stripped of the complex rhetoric of the printed page. In the literary humanities, we are still readers of books.</p>

<title>On ordering chronologically</title>

</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>1 Systems of organisation</title>
<p>One of the first decisions that needs to be made when planning any literary edition is how to arrange its contents, and how in particular to determine the sequence in which its various texts will be set out. At an early stage in the preparation of <italic>The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Ben Jonson</italic> my colleagues David Bevington, Martin Butler, and I made what seemed at the time to be a relatively simple decision. With only the vaguest sense of the possible benefits, revelations, and headaches this choice would ultimately bring, we agreed to arrange Jonson&#x2019;s texts chronologically, according to the known or presumed dates at which they had been composed or performed or pub lished &#x2013; postponing for the moment the further editorial puzzles and dilemmas that lay behind that initial set of wavering options.</p>
<p>With many authors from the early modern period &#x2013; Marlowe, let&#x2019;s say, the dates of whose various writings are still quite speculatively debated &#x2013; a chrono -logical arrangement might not have been easy to achieve. But in Jonson&#x2019;s case the records of court and theatre performance are altogether more plentiful, and most of his writings, as we knew, could be dated, often with some precision. The details of Jonson&#x2019;s personal life are likewise more fully known than those of many of his contemporaries. No previous edition of Jonson&#x2019;s writings had been organised along chronological lines, and no attempt had ever previously been made to assemble a detailed chronology of his life and writings. This seemed like a challenge worth seizing. So we agreed to lay out the texts within the seven-volume print edition of the Cambridge <italic>Ben Jonson</italic> in the order of their dating, and to provide moreover in the accompanying online edition a full chronology of Jonson&#x2019;s life and works that would also refer selectively to social and political events of the time, and to the principal writings of Jonson&#x2019;s contemporaries.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_33"><sup>33</sup></xref></p>
<p>In making this decision we consciously rejected the organisational principles adopted by C.H. Herford and Percy and Evelyn Simpson in their monumental 11-volume Oxford <italic>Ben Jonson</italic>, an edition whose contents had been largely arranged in relation to genre. The first two volumes of this edition, published in 1925, offered biographical and other preliminary materials: a life of the author, legal and parish records, and letters, along with critical introductions to Jonson&#x2019;s major writings. The next four volumes, published between 1927 and 1938, presented all of Jonson&#x2019;s work for the theatre, apart from a couple of late unfinished plays that were somewhat incongruously carried over into volume seven, published in 1941: an already bulging com pendium of Jonson&#x2019;s masques and entertainments written over nearly four decades for royal and aristocratic patrons. Volume eight, published in 1947, contained Jonson&#x2019;s non-dramatic verse: the three major collections of his poems (<italic>Epigrams</italic>, <italic>The Forest</italic>, <italic>The Underwood</italic>), his two translations of Horace&#x2019;s <italic>Ars poetica</italic>, along
<target target-type="page" id="page_229"/>with poems dubiously attributed to him, and a further group of miscellaneous pieces written at very different periods of his life, now brought together editorially as if to constitute another poetic collec tion under the (somewhat paradoxical) title &#x2018;Ungathered Verse&#x2019;. Jonson&#x2019;s prose writings made up the rest of this volume: his commonplace book, <italic>Discoveries</italic>, his <italic>English Grammar</italic>, and a number of English and Latin inscriptions. The final three volumes of the Oxford edition, published between 1950 and 1952, offered a survey of the text, stage histories, a literary record, and extended commentaries on the works.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_34"><sup>34</sup></xref></p>
<p>To distribute Jonson&#x2019;s works in this way into generically distinct volumes &#x2013; locating the plays in one part of the edition, court masques in another, poems and prose elsewhere &#x2013; seemed to us a curiously a-historical tactic, more likely to hide than to reveal potential connections between one kind of writing and another, and between the life of the artist and the works he created. Such an arrangement seemed furthermore to obscure the peculiar shape and progress of the writer&#x2019;s career, and the suggestive power of what Carl Jung had termed <italic>synchronicity</italic>: the simultaneous occurrence of similar-seeming events or (in the present context) artistic experiments and innovations by Jonson and other writers of his time.</p>
<p>It was therefore the more surprising to recall that an arrangement of much this kind had been favoured by Jonson himself while preparing &#x2013; in his mid-forties, still very much in mid-career &#x2013; the folio edition of his <italic>Works</italic> for publication by William Stansby in 1616.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_35"><sup>35</sup></xref> For this landmark collection Jonson chose to present his major works in groups determined by literary genre: beginning challengingly with the plays (reckoned by some of his contem -poraries to be an anomalous inclusion in a volume bearing the serious title <italic>Works</italic>); moving next to the non-dramatic poetry, <italic>Epigrams</italic> and <italic>The Forest</italic>, here published together as verse collections for the first time; then back in time, to works written at the very outset of James&#x2019;s reign, Part of the <italic>King&#x2019;s Entertainment and Panegyre</italic> (both presented to the new King in 1604); then on to a series of entertainments and masques performed between 1603 and 1616, the year of the folio&#x2019;s publication.</p>
<p>Subsequent editions of Jonson&#x2019;s works had all been influenced by the genre-based model of the 1616 folio, which is adopted with minor variations for the second folio of 1640&#x2013;1, the third folio of 1692, and the so-called &#x2018;booksellers&#x2019; edition&#x2019; of 1716&#x2013;17. In presenting the first scholarly edition of Jonson&#x2019;s writings in 1756, Peter Whalley claimed to have introduced a new organ isational method, &#x2018;different from what hath been observed before&#x2019;, yet he too arranged Jonson&#x2019;s texts in generically related clusters: the plays first, &#x2018;in the order of time according to which they were first performed&#x2019;, followed by the entertainments and masques similarly set out in order of performance, followed by the poems, followed by the prose writings, with texts of uncertain date scattered somewhat randomly throughout.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_36"><sup>36</sup></xref> William Gifford&#x2019;s nine-volume edition of 1816 similarly led off with a volume of &#x2018;memoirs&#x2019; and biographically related materials, moving then to the plays, then in successive volumes to entertainments, masques, poems, and prose works, all grouped according to genre.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_37"><sup>37</sup></xref></p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_230"/>Each of these editions perpetuated a basic arrangement of Jonson&#x2019;s works that could be traced back to the author&#x2019;s own design, yet none (we believed) gave a true sense of the range and heterogeneity of his writing, or of the complex movement of his career. Could the chronological arrangement we planned for the Cambridge edition offer a new way of looking at Jonson&#x2019;s life and work? Before that question could be answered, however, there were other practical matters to resolve. What system or systems of dating would we adopt in ordering the sequence of texts within the edition? Here are a few of the options we soon began to review.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>2 Systems of dating</title>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>(a) The calendar year and the legal year</title>
<p>Two principal systems of dating (among several competing practices) were current in Jonson&#x2019;s England. Dates could be reckoned according to the calendar year, which (as in most Western countries today) began on 1 January and ran to 31 December. There was also, however, the legal or Marian year, which began on 25 March, Lady&#x2019;s Day (the feast of the Annunciation), and was widely used in a variety of legal and other contexts.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_38"><sup>38</sup></xref> To the frequent confusion of modern scholars, Ben Jonson appears to have used both systems, in no obviously predictable or consistent fashion. Reviewing in 1926 the first two volumes of the Oxford <italic>Ben Jonson</italic>, Sir Walter Greg pointed out that its editors, misled by the author&#x2019;s varying practice, had often been muddled or mistaken in the dates they assigned to the works, committing &#x2018;the grossest inconsistencies&#x2019; in their arrangement of the material.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_39"><sup>39</sup></xref> The editors replied somewhat curtly to Greg&#x2019;s critique, undertaking to look into these matters in a later volume; a promise which &#x2013; overburdened as they were by the massive task of bringing the edition to completion &#x2013; they never managed to fulfil.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_40"><sup>40</sup></xref></p>
<p>Determined meanwhile to unravel what he called &#x2018;the riddle of Jonson&#x2019;s chronology&#x2019;, Greg published later in 1926 an influential study with that title offering an explanation for Jonson&#x2019;s varying practice: arguing that while he had chosen in his 1616 folio to date most of his writings according to the calendar year, he had varied his system around 1620, dating most of his works thereafter according to the legal year. This argument was largely accepted by the Oxford editors, but was subjected to closer scrutiny in an illuminating study by Martin Butler during the preparation of the Cam bridge edition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_41"><sup>41</sup></xref> Butler showed that Jonson&#x2019;s datings could not be explained in the manner that Greg had suggested, but were inconsistent at virtually all stages of his career; and that many of the dates that Greg had assumed to have derived directly from Jonson could in any case equally have been supplied by printers, booksellers, or other intermediaries. In establishing a defensible calendar-based chronology that would be immediately intelligible to users of the edition in the twenty-first century, we needed therefore to consider each work on its merits, remaining wary of title-page datings, and assessing a wider range of historical and contextual evidence than earlier editors had invariably managed to assemble.</p>
<target target-type="page" id="page_231"/>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>(b)	Dates of composition</title>
<p>Compositional dates are notoriously hard to identify with any precision, and were seldom much help to us in determining the placing of texts in the Cambridge edition. Some texts, we recognised, had probably been in gestation over a period of years or even of decades, as the author planned, drafted, abandoned, resumed, and finally finished them off at widely spaced intervals within a long and busy professional life. Jonson&#x2019;s comedy <italic>A Tale of a Tub</italic> &#x2013; which, as computational tests have increasingly revealed, shows a curious mix of &#x2018;early&#x2019; and &#x2018;late&#x2019; stylistic features &#x2013; could well have been composed in this intermittent and protracted fashion.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_42"><sup>42</sup></xref> The Oxford editors conjectured that Jonson had written this play at the outset of his career around 1596/7, then put it aside, only to rediscover it in his final years and revise it lightly for per -formance. They therefore placed <italic>A Tale of a Tub</italic> at the head of their first volume of the plays, as Jonson&#x2019;s earliest surviving drama. Students punting on the Cam traditionally wield their poles from the opposite end of the boat from that favoured on the Cherwell, and in a similar contrarian spirit we inverted the Oxford order, placing <italic>A Tale of a Tub</italic> at the nether end of the Cambridge edition. In so doing we were swayed not only by recent revisionist arguments concerning the style and content of the play, but also by its performance history. <italic>A Tale of a Tub</italic> was licensed by the Master of the Revels, Sir Henry Herbert, on 7 May 1633, and is likely to have been acted shortly thereafter. On the strength of this firmly docu mented date in particular, we reckoned <italic>A Tale of a Tub</italic> to be, for the purposes of ordering in the edition, a late play of Jonson&#x2019;s, not an early one, and placed it accordingly in the edition.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>(c)	Dates of performance</title>
<p>The positioning of plays, entertainments, and masques within the Cam bridge edition was invariably determined by the date of performance, whenever that date was known &#x2013; though occasionally it was not, as with the generally perplexing <italic>Cavendish Christening Entertainment</italic>, whose circumstances pre -sented a number of riddles. Faced with such teasing texts, the editors were obliged to make a best guess as to their likely date and appropriate place in the edition. (The Cavendish entertainment was finally dated, with a meas ure of trust, at 1619, and located in volume 5, 399&#x2013;415.) In one instance &#x2013; Jonson&#x2019;s even more shadowy lost pastoral, <italic>The May Lord</italic> (described laconically to Drummond, <italic>Informations</italic>, 307&#x2013;12) &#x2013; we were not merely unsure when it had been performed &#x2013; perhaps at Penshurst in the summer of 1610? &#x2013; but whether it was even designed for performance in the first place, finally deciding it was not. Guessing it to have been a &#x2018;closet&#x2019; work still under composition at the time of Jonson&#x2019;s journey to Scotland, we pushed its date forward to 1618, and summarised our conclusions in volume 5, 343&#x2013;5.</p>
<p>Even when performance dates were clearly known, however, the texts that we placed at the corresponding spot in the edition would at times inevitably be of a later vintage. Jonson&#x2019;s tragedy <italic>Sejanus</italic> (for example) was probably performed in 1603, as the 1616 folio title-page declares, and as the Cambridge
<target target-type="page" id="page_232"/>editor, Tom Cain, persuasively argues; but the text of the play that we placed at this spot was necessarily that of the 1605 quarto; the original acting text, which may have prompted Jonson&#x2019;s troubles with the authorities, having long since vanished. Jonson carefully draws attention to this substitution in his address &#x2018;To the Readers&#x2019; (31&#x2013;5), which he attributes (with a modest disclaimer) to collegial and aesthetic factors, not the need to avoid further scrutiny from
<p>the authorities:<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_43"><sup>43</sup></xref></p>
<p>Lastly, I would inform you that this book, in all numbers, is not the same with that which is acted on the public stage, wherein a second pen had good share: in place of which I have rather chosen to put weaker (and no doubt less pleasing) of mine own, than to defraud so happy a genius of his right by my loathed usurpation.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>(d)	Dates of revision</title>
<p>Throughout his long life as a writer, Jonson tinkered constantly with his earlier work, revising and re-revising texts for publication. These revisions can generally be tracked in the Cambridge edition through collation notes located at the foot of the page, but in a handful of cases were too extensive to be conveyed in this fashion, and are presented instead through multiple texts, provided either in complete or partial form. Thus the complete 1601 quarto text of <italic>Every Man In His Humour</italic> in its Florentine setting is placed in chrono -logical sequence at 1598, its known performance date, while the complete revised version of the comedy, with its London setting, is placed at 1616, the date of its first publication (the precise dates of its composition and first per -formance being unknown).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_44"><sup>44</sup></xref> The quarto text of <italic>Cynthia&#x2019;s Revels</italic>, published in 1601, is placed at the known date of its first performance in 1600, but extensively revised scenes from the last three acts, first published in the 1616 folio, are printed separately in the edition at that date. Jonson&#x2019;s masque of <italic>The Gypsies Metamorphosed</italic> was so enjoyed by King James when first presented at Burley in 1621 that it was re-played later that year with some revision at Belvoir, then a third time, with more extensive revision, at Windsor. The Cambridge edition gives the Burley text in full, with an appendix showing the revised passages for Belvoir, followed by the Windsor text in full. So close in time to each other were these revisions that the three versions of the masque can be grouped in immediate sequence in the edition, one after the other.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>(e)	Dates of publication</title>
<p>Poetry, prose, and other texts not intended for performance are generally placed within the edition according to their date of publication &#x2013; though Jonson&#x2019;s letters, written with no thought of their ultimate publication (and often not recovered until many years after their author&#x2019;s death), are placed throughout according to their date of composition. Similarly placed are Jonson&#x2019;s <italic>Informations to William Drummond of Hawthornden</italic>, Drummond&#x2019;s private notes of Jonson&#x2019;s gossip and opinions, jotted down by Drummond during
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_233"/>Jonson&#x2019;s visit to Hawthornden over the Christmas and New Year season of 1618/1619.</p>
<p>Jonson&#x2019;s poetry, however, presented a particular problem. Most of the occa -sional poems that Herford and Simpson brought together in their miscellany of <italic>Ungathered Verse</italic> are readily datable, and are redistributed accordingly throughout the Cambridge edition. Many poems from within Jonson&#x2019;s own major collections, <italic>Epigrams</italic>, <italic>The Forest</italic>, and <italic>The Underwood</italic> can also be dated with reasonable accuracy. After some debate we agreed never theless to preserve these collections <italic>as collections</italic>, in order to maintain the careful internal arrangement that Jonson himself had been at evident pains to achieve; placing them <italic>en bloc</italic> at the dates of their folio publication: 1616 (for <italic>Epigrams</italic> and <italic>The Forest</italic>) and 1640 (for <italic>The Underwood</italic>).</p>

<title>3 The rewards</title>
<p>What were the benefits of ordering the edition in this way? The chrono logical arrangement revealed, for a start, the unusual trajectory of Jonson&#x2019;s career, which differed in significant ways from the dominant model in early modern Europe, inherited from classical antiquity: that of the <italic>rota Vergiliana</italic>. The <italic>rota</italic> followed the supposed movement of Virgil&#x2019;s career from the simple pastoral exercises of the <italic>Eclogues</italic>, written in the poet&#x2019;s youth, to the more ambitious <italic>Georgics</italic>, completed in his middle years, and thence to the heights of epic, the <italic>Aeneid</italic>, the supreme achievement of his maturity. This steady advance through different genres of increasing scale and complexity was figured as linear and ascending, yet at the same time circular &#x2013; as the very word <italic>rota</italic> implies, recalling the wheel of the muses&#x2019; chariot &#x2013; the writer returning in maturity to fulfil a promise of achievement offered in his youth. The literary progress of writers such as Dante and Petrarch in Italy, and of Spenser, Drayton, and Milton in England could be accommodated, with minor adjustment and flexible attention to biograph ical fact, to fit this ideal pattern. A writer such as Shakespeare, on the other hand, conformed less obviously to the Virgilian model, his progress being boosted, yet also deflected from the conventional pathway, by the huge demands of London&#x2019;s newly established theatres, which chiefly commanded his attention throughout his working life.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_45"><sup>45</sup></xref></p>
<p>Jonson&#x2019;s career, too, was irregular if judged in terms of the Virgilian model, towards which he nevertheless made occasional gestures. In <italic>Poetaster</italic> he introduced the historical character of Virgil, highlighting his intimacy with the emperor Augustus, who, in a climactic scene of the play (5.2), invites Virgil to read to him from the <italic>Aeneid</italic>, seating him on a chair set higher than his own: suggesting an exemplary relationship between poet and ruler to which Jonson himself, even at this early stage of his own career, ambitiously aspired. In the 1616 folio Jonson carefully placed the works he had written for James (whom he hailed as a new Augustus) at the end of the volume, the culminating position in the sequence of his writings. Two years later he spoke to William Drummond of undertaking, as if in emulation of Virgil, an epic poem &#x2018;entitled <italic>Heroologia</italic>, of the worthies of his country roused by fame&#x2019; (<italic>Informations</italic>, 1&#x2013;3): a project he failed to complete, but may have regarded as a necessary step in
<target target-type="page" id="page_234"/>his literary career. In one of his last plays he speaks of finding himself &#x2018;now near the close or shutting up of his circle&#x2019; (<italic>The Magnetic Lady</italic>, Induction, 79&#x2013;80), a figure that inevitably recalls the Virgilian <italic>rota</italic>.</p>
<p>As we began to arrange Jonson&#x2019;s various writings into chronological order for the Cambridge edition, however, a more idiosyncratic pattern of the author&#x2019;s progress began to emerge, that conformed neither to the Virgilian model nor to that proposed by the editors of the Oxford <italic>Ben Jonson</italic>, for whom Jonson&#x2019;s life and works seemed &#x2018;singularly continuous&#x2019; and &#x2018;in a rare degree, of a piece&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_46"><sup>46</sup></xref> Here instead, as the sequence of texts revealed, was a writer of startling versatility, capable of switching with agility from one literary form to another, from one rhetorical position to another.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, this run of events early in James&#x2019;s reign. A few days after James&#x2019;s arrival from Scotland (7 May 1603), Jonson&#x2019;s tragedy <italic>Sejanus</italic> &#x2013; largely written in the final months of Elizabeth&#x2019;s reign &#x2013; is performed in London (9&#x2013;16 May?), presenting the new monarch and his followers with a scathing vision of court corruption, for which the author will eventually be summoned before the Privy Council (7 November 1605?). Jonson then pre pares an entertainment for the new Queen and her son &#x2018;as they came first into the kingdom&#x2019; (<italic>Althorp</italic>, performed on 25 and 27 June 1603), together with verses of welcome to the King on his entry to the City of London and his first Parliament (<italic>Part of the King&#x2019;s Entertainment</italic> and <italic>Panegyre</italic>, designed for delivery in July 1603, but postponed until March 1604). Early in 1604 he is thrown out of court after causing a disturbance during the performance of a masque (Daniel&#x2019;s <italic>Vision of the Twelve Goddesses</italic>, 8 January?) together with his friend Sir John Roe, who urges him to forget his ambitions for advancement at court (&#x2018;let all pass&#x2019;).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_47"><sup>47</sup></xref> A few months later he devises the first of his masques for Queen Anne, in collaboration with Inigo Jones (<italic>Blackness</italic>, performed Twelfth Night 1605). He then co-authors a comedy satirising James and his fellow countrymen (<italic>Eastward Ho!</italic> presented during the King&#x2019;s absence in mid-July/late August 1605), for which he and his collaborator George Chapman are promptly imprisoned, and threatened with physical violence; they plead abjectly to the King and his counsellors for clemency (letters, 31 August/4 September).</p>
<p>Released from gaol, Jonson attends a supper party (9 October?) with leading conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot, who plan to blow up Westminster Hall on 5 November. The Plot is revealed on 26 October by William Parker, Lord Monteagle, to whom Jonson then prudently directs a congratulatory poem (<italic>Epigrams</italic>, 60). On 7 November he receives a warrant to assist Robert Cecil in his enquiries into the Plot, and on 8 November reports to Cecil on his progress. During January 1606 the Gunpowder conspirators are tried, and many of its ringleaders, well known to Jonson, are executed. On 5 and 6 January 1606 Jonson&#x2019;s masque <italic>Hymenaei</italic> is presented at Whitehall in celebration of the marriage of the young Robert Devereux with Frances Howard, daughter of the Lord Chamberlain, Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk, to whom Jonson has recently written beseechingly from prison. On 9 and 10 January Jonson and his wife are cited for recusancy, and instructed to answer charges before the Consistory Court in April. Against this background of
<target target-type="page" id="page_235"/>judicial enquiry, incarceration, and public terror, Jonson composes at high speed (&#x2018;five weeks fully penned it&#x2019;) his comedy <italic>Volpone</italic>, performed at the Globe probably in mid-March of that year, ridiculing the incompetence and brutality of the Venetian courts of justice, and the readiness of a gullible English traveller named Sir Politic Would-be to find plots wherever he looks.</p>
<p>Setting Jonson&#x2019;s writings out in this fashion &#x2013; month by month, week by week, and at times day by day, in relation to events of the time &#x2013; exposes, even in this highly abridged and schematic form, the diversity of projects upon which Jonson was employed, often simultaneously, at any moment of his working life. (During slack intervals in this same busy period he completed other enter -tainments and poems, including an elegy on the death of his seven-year-old son and a translation of Horace&#x2019;s <italic>Ars poetica</italic>.) The arrangement highlights also the contemporaneity of so much of his writing, its immediate responsiveness to social and political events of the day. It reveals, more astonishingly, the manner in which he zig-zagged perilously, and with the odd near-fatal stumble, between contrasting modes of writing: satire, eulogy, comedy, lyric.</p>
<p>In modern times the trajectory of Jonson&#x2019;s career has often been traced in a more singular fashion, in relation simply to his work for the stage. David Kay&#x2019;s influential account of &#x2018;the shaping of Jonson&#x2019;s career&#x2019; (1970) focuses solely on his early theatrical work. Anne Barton&#x2019;s <italic>Ben Jonson: Dramatist</italic> (1984) stays similarly within the playhouse, reading with particular effect Jonson&#x2019;s final plays, in a bid to reverse the sketch first drawn by Dryden of the playwright&#x2019;s career drooping in his middle years, then declining sharply thereafter into
<p>&#x2018;dotages&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_48"><sup>48</sup></xref></p>
<p>Yet the shape of Jonson&#x2019;s career can also be mapped against a wider range of activities and accomplishments. For all his astonishing brilliance as a dramatist, Jonson maintained an acutely ambivalent relationship with the theatre, which, at the height of his powers, he described contemptuously as a place where &#x2018;nothing but the garbage of the time is uttered, and that with such impropriety of phrase, such plenty of solecisms, such dearth of sense, so bold prolepses, so racked metaphors, with brothelry able to violate the ear of a pagan and blasphemy to turn the blood of a Christian to water&#x2019; (<italic>Volpone</italic>, Epistle, 67&#x2013;70). He uttered this verdict in 1607, when &#x2013; as a Chronology including contemporary work will remind us &#x2013; Londoners had had the opportunity of seeing, during the previous three or four years, the first performances of <italic>Macbeth</italic>, <italic>Troilus and Cressida</italic>, <italic>All&#x2019;s Well That Ends Well</italic>, <italic>Antony and Cleopatra</italic>, <italic>Othello</italic>, <italic>King Lear</italic>, <italic>Measure for Measure</italic>, and <italic>Timon of Athens</italic>, to say nothing of works by Marston, Middleton, and Jonson himself. From 1616, when he received a royal pension, Jonson was to abandon dramatic writing altogether for a decade. He returned to this work in the mid-1620s, then after the fiasco of <italic>The New Inn</italic> again renounced &#x2018;the loath&#x00E8;d stage&#x2019;, to which in the final years of his life he returned once more with <italic>The Magnetic Lady</italic> and <italic>A Tale of a Tub</italic>.</p>
<p>Despite his illness and partial immobility, Jonson was eager throughout these years, as befitted a true pupil of William Camden, to excel in all branches of humane learning. He remained intensely curious about the world around him. He was fascinated by the new science, observing with the greatest attention new
<target target-type="page" id="page_236"/>developments in mathematics and optics and astronomy and magnetic theory; listening to the current disputes about the ageing of the world, and the possibility of life on other planets; watching with some amusement the journeys taken down the Thames by Cornelis Drebbel in his primitive submarine, propelled by oars; learning about the experiments, conducted by several of his friends, with burning glasses, a potential weapon in naval warfare. He swapped ideas with colleagues at Christ Church and in Cambridge and at Gresham College, and with the intellectual groups that had formed at Bolsover and Great Tew. He interested himself in Welsh grammar, in spelling and alphabetical reform, in direct method teaching of foreign languages, in textual scholarship, in the rise of newspapers, in ecclesiastical disputes in the parishes of north London, and in the deepening political crisis that confronted the country. His most ambitious works from this period, the masques and entertainments he produced for James and for Charles and Henrietta Maria and for the man he hailed as his &#x2018;best patron&#x2019;, William Cavendish, show undiminished agility, both poetic and political. He translated writings by classical and modern authors. He studied the Church fathers and the writings of Machiavelli. He composed two English grammars. He helped John Heminges and Henry Condell to prepare the first folio edition of the plays of his friend William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>No editorial rearrangement will in itself recover this view of Jonson, which must be gained, as Eliot recommended years ago, from &#x2018;intelligent saturation in his work as a whole&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_49"><sup>49</sup></xref> But it can point the way; which is all in the end that editions may be able to do.</p>

<title>The problem</title>
<p>How do you edit the following example? In 1648, Robert Herrick prints a 22-line dialogue entitled &#x2018;<italic>Mrs</italic>. Eliz. <italic>Wheeler, under the name of the Lost Shepherdesse</italic>&#x2019; in his <italic>Works</italic>. The likeliest date of original composition is before 1613, given the reasonably reliable identification of the addressee as Herrick&#x2019;s Cheapside neighbour, Elizabeth Wheeler, who married Simon English in 1613. Herrick was then a goldsmith&#x2019;s apprentice with expensive taste in clothes (&#x00A3;8 for apparel appears in his uncle&#x2019;s accounts), a talent for poetry strongly influenced at this point by the output of Ben Jonson, and with an inclination, even at the relatively late age of twenty-two, to go to university rather than carry on his family&#x2019;s highly lucrative trade.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_50"><sup>50</sup></xref> However, that printing, some thirty-six years after its probable composition, is not the dialogue&#x2019;s first entrance into print nor its last, and its long and complex history of
<target target-type="page" id="page_237"/>transmission in both manuscript and print continues into the 1670s. Only nineteen independent manuscript and print witnesses sur vive, just enough to show that the idea of the stable text and the proprietary author assumed and perpetuated by modern print-based editing practices are not so much challenged as laughed at by the practices this tradition showcases. Of course, the conflict between the nature of the tradition being edited and the tools and theories with which we edit is a central problem of all editing, and the steps editors take to negotiate that conflict are at the heart of editing practice. As a case study, this example illustrates the key problem of how to reconcile modern author-centred models of the text with the much more diffuse understanding of textual authority that prevails in our period, with particular reference to the problems faced by editors of early modern lyric poetry.</p>
<p>Tom Cain and I edited this version of &#x2018;Mistress Elizabeth Wheeler&#x2019; for Volume Two of <italic>The Complete Works of Robert Herrick</italic>, which focuses on those poems which circulated in manuscript prior to the publication of the <italic>Works</italic>. Since Herrick prints revised versions of almost all of these poems in 1648, the manuscript versions had been less considered by scholars and editors of his work.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_51"><sup>51</sup></xref> Our inclusion of them in a separate volume rather than as an appendix to the edition reflects the current emphasis on manuscript publication as a medium in its own right, summed up by Steven May&#x2019;s comment in this volume (2.2.1) that &#x2018;to edit a manuscript today and not provide the evidence for determining its scribal context through textual criticism is in my opinion a lapse of editorial responsibility in an age when scribal culture is of significant scholarly interest&#x2019;. This demand for increased attention to scribal culture within a publishing environment predominantly weighted towards single-author print editions does give rise to difficult-to-resolve questions in terms of how to represent these traditions in a final edited form, given that, as I argue below, an edition which prioritises the practices of scribal culture will operate with a significantly different concept of the work and the edition.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>The surviving witnesses</title>
<p>Our first task was to establish or try to establish the relationship between the witnesses to &#x2018;the Lost Shepherdesse&#x2019; with a view to determining their relative authority, that is, of judging how close they come to the wording of a text the author intended. There is no surviving text of &#x2018;the Lost Shepherdesse&#x2019; in Herrick&#x2019;s hand, although we do have an authorised printed text and a manuscript in the hand of his collaborator Henry Lawes, although both are produced quite late in the history of the poem. We first transcribed all the surviving witnesses and compared them line for line, looking for variants which might suggest a common source, taking Harold Love&#x2019;s view that not only shared errors but also the plausible alternative readings shared by witnesses are clues to an origin in a specific &#x2018;parent&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_52"><sup>52</sup></xref></p>
<p>The first characteristic we noted was that the poem survives in three different lengths: 26 lines (six witnesses), 24 lines (2 witnesses) and 22 lines (11 witnesses). Our task then was to establish whether we were dealing with three distinct versions, or with texts that are the product of a copyist or copyists
<target target-type="page" id="page_238"/>dropping or omitting lines, or a combination of the two. The first witness to the 24-line poem, and also, as it happens, the earliest surviving record in the whole tradition is an Inns of Court verse miscellany, now in the William Clark Library in Los Angeles, which is signed by an owner Michael Keepis in 1636.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_53"><sup>53</sup></xref> The other 24-line witness is the next earliest, a 1638 miscellany now in the New York Public Library, signed by the Oxford student Hugh Barrow.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_54"><sup>54</sup></xref></p>
<p>Our collations showed that the copyists of both these manuscripts were using the same source, one which transposed lines and introduced a number of unique variants though each copyist was working at a different remove from that parent. Both were required to sophisticate to make sense of what they had indicating a difficult-to-read source. Their parent, for example, instead of reading &#x2018;In yonder Tulip&#x2019; as all the other witnesses to the poem do, had a phrase which the Keepis&#x2019; miscellany copyist eventually renders as &#x2018;In <italic>the</italic> smirke Tulip&#x2019;, and which Barrow transcribes as &#x2018;In <italic>the</italic> sweetest July&#x2019;, a plausible if careless rendering of the original reading of &#x2018;Tulip&#x2019;, the copyist probably thinking of the Julyflower (a generic name for clove-scented flowers). At this point we might have concluded that the 24-line version was a damaged and corrupted version of a 26-line original. However, unlike the 26-line version, the 24-line version contains one reading &#x2018;At the which&#x2019; (21) which it shares with all the 22-line texts against the 26-line witnesses. Since &#x2018;At the which&#x2019; is also Herrick&#x2019;s preferred reading in his printed <italic>Works</italic>, this raises the possibility that while the 24-line witnesses might well be damaged they may also be the only witnesses to a second authorial version of the poem, cut down and revised by Herrick from the original 26-line version.</p>
<p>But how to verify this? The earliest witness to the 26-line version is in Thomas Carew&#x2019;s posthumous <italic>Poems</italic> of 1640, not in itself a problem since a late witness may well transmit an early version of a poem. Scott Nixon&#x2019;s work has identified this publication as a combination of a fairly reliable manuscript collection of Carew&#x2019;s poems with a MS verse miscellany that contained poems by Carew and several other poets; this version of &#x2018;Mistress Elizabeth Wheeler&#x2019; is found in the miscellany section of the 1640 imprint.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_55"><sup>55</sup></xref> That 26-line version appears again in a further five manuscripts, two of which refer to Carew&#x2019;s <italic>Poems</italic> as their source. In another of these five witnesses, the copyist or another copyist in the chain of transmission appears to have at one point amended the copy of the poem against the text in <italic>Hesperides</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_56"><sup>56</sup></xref> The text of Carew and its fellow witnesses agrees reasonably closely with the text in <italic>Hesperides</italic>, though the Carew &#x2018;group&#x2019; reads &#x2018;shall&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;must&#x2019; in lines 22 and 25, dis tinguishing this 26-line version of the text from all other witnesses. Whether this is the original reading or whether it is a change made by a copyist somewhere in the chain of trans mission (assuming that all the 26-line witnesses ultimately descend from that altered source) is unknown. Of course, if the 26-line version is altered here then it might just as plausibly have been altered at line 21 as well, rendering our proposed distinction between the 24-line and the 26-line copy null and void. It is one thing therefore to identify shared variants but much more difficult to use them as a reliable guide to determine the actual relationship of witnesses to one another, and in many cases these relationships need to be understood schematically as a description of a
<target target-type="page" id="page_239"/>pattern of existing rela tionships rather than as a claim about the actual processes of copying that took place.</p>
<p>The immediate parent of the 22-line versions, however, is much easier to identify. The likely source is the version or versions of the text produced for (or possibly by) Herrick&#x2019;s long-time friend and collaborator, the King&#x2019;s musician Henry Lawes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_57"><sup>57</sup></xref> A 22-line version of the poem in a musical setting is entered into Lawes&#x2019; chronologically ordered autograph songbook in a location which suggests it was set sometime between 1638 and 1643.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_58"><sup>58</sup></xref> The earlier date is the likelier since a version of Lawes&#x2019; setting &#x2013; with a variant text of the poem &#x2013; appears in an anonymous 1639 songbook now at the Clark Library. The 22-line length is unique in the Herrick/Lawes repertoire and is not optimal for the setting as it forces a repetition of the final two lines (rather than the usual one) to the last half of the musical setting, suggesting that rather than this being a co-composed work, Lawes received a 22-line text to set. So it would appear that Herrick is inclined to shorten lyrics as he revises them. Lawes&#x2019; setting circulated rapidly among his peers, initiating this poem&#x2019;s long performance history. A third version of Lawes&#x2019; setting with another variant 22-line text appears in a songbook originally associated with another court musician, Ambrose Beeland, and Beeland or an associate might well have gotten it from Lawes and tweaked the text or setting himself; another distant witness to the same source is the copy in a Scottish verse miscellany NLS MS 19.3.4.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_59"><sup>59</sup></xref> Another transcription of the lyric with Lawes&#x2019; setting is in an anonymous Bodleian songbook associated with another of Herrick&#x2019;s collaborators, the Cambridge composer Robert Ramsey, but this particular entry takes half its song-text from a manuscript source and then copies the final eleven lines from Hesperides.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_60"><sup>60</sup></xref> It appears again in John Playford&#x2019;s unauthorised 1652 printing of Henry Lawes&#x2019; settings in <italic>Select Musical Ayres and Dialogues</italic>, but Playford takes the text of the poem not from <italic>Hesperides</italic> or from Lawes&#x2019; papers but from a 22-line text in the 1645 edition of Humphrey Moseley&#x2019;s middle-brow bestseller <italic>The Academy of Complements</italic> (Wing G1401A). This coincides with a boom in the poem&#x2019;s popularity. Moseley will reprint the poem in seven further editions published between 1646 and 1684, and Playford will print lyric and setting a further four times. Playford will also republish the poem in the 1667 songbook, <italic>The Musical Companion</italic> using a Lawes setting this time for three voices, probably using as its basis the copy of the song and setting in his own manuscript partbooks (Glasgow MSS R.d.58&#x2013;60). Two more late-seventeenth-century manuscript witnesses copy the text from a printed Playford songbook: a verse miscellany in several hands that takes many of its poems from Playford&#x2019;s 1653 reissue of <italic>Select Ayres</italic> and a partial copy transcribed from <italic>The Musical Companion</italic> that is entered on a folio leaf at the end of a 1613 edition of Thomas Campion&#x2019;s <italic>The First Book of Ayres</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_61"><sup>61</sup></xref> That book is nothing to do with Herrick. Despite the occasional use of the text in <italic>Hesperides</italic>, there is no attribution to him in any of these witnesses.</p>
<p>This practice of tracing witnesses (also called recension) has produced a fairly common outcome. Rather than providing a secure line of descent, the tradition is complicated and destabilised and a partial view of a complex and often highly confusing textual environment is exposed. Any conclusions drawn from this
<target target-type="page" id="page_240"/>evidence must be contingent, hedged with qualifications, and with the confident knowledge that at least some of those conclusions are completely wrong. Many of the assumptions of the editing process are also questioned by this evidence. While the integrity and authenticity of their texts were clearly of considerable concern to Lawes and to Herrick, both of whom oversaw authorised printings of their work, they did not trouble either manuscript copyists or print publishers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_62"><sup>62</sup></xref> The text is constantly undergoing change, not only by the poet who probably is revising mid-circulation but also by the copyists, though the latter&#x2019;s changes are typically prompted by flaws or gaps in their exemplar rather than an impulse towards their own creative reworkings.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_63"><sup>63</sup></xref> The fact that the &#x2018;Lost Shepherdesse&#x2019; is lyric poetry which has been set to music significantly increases the complexity of the tradition and the freedom with which musicians, copyists, and publishers handle it. The introduction of an authorised printed text approximately half-way through the cycle has very little influence on the development of the tradition. Essentially, the authorised printed text seems to have been used as another resource a copyist could use if they have a damaged text or prefer the print readings. Our governing distinction between a &#x2018;manu -script poem&#x2019; and a &#x2018;print poem&#x2019; is also disrupted. Print and manu script here are facets of a bigger system of composition, appropriation, and recirculation. Moreover, the evidence of this tradition suggests writing for a particular medium does not necessarily translate into a greater or lesser respect for either poem or poet. What broadly speaking this tradition reveals is that the idea of a single authorial text both is and is not an anachronistic expectation. Both Lawes and Herrick go to great lengths to ensure an authorised text of this lyric is produced in their lifetimes; the readers and copyists of this particular text are largely untroubled by that authority.</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>The problem in relation to Intentionalist and Materialist theories</title>
<p>So to return to the opening question. How do &#x2013; or, better put &#x2013; how should we edit this tradition? More specifically, how do we edit it for a printed scholarly edition entitled <italic>The Complete Poetry of Robert Herrick</italic>? When we place these findings in dialogue with the tradition of Anglo-American editing in which we were working, what possibilities emerge and what theoretical assumptions are tested? David Greetham deftly divides this tradition into intentionalist and materialist schools of thought.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_64"><sup>64</sup></xref> Broadly, the intentionalist school aims to establish a text representative of (usually) the author&#x2019;s intentions at a specified point in the composition process. Sometimes called &#x2018;idealist&#x2019; or &#x2018;essentialist&#x2019;, this editing frames its work as repairing faults brought about by the contingencies and losses of material transmission: scribal error, sophisti -cation and interpolation, compositor error, tears, and blots. The text finally established may not be extant in any surviving historical witness but be an &#x2018;eclectic text&#x2019; created editorially using the process of collation to identify and then emend readings judged to be non-authorial. It is theoretically possible, for example, to create an eclectic text of &#x2018;the Lost Shepherdesse&#x2019; using readings shared between the surviving witnesses and the authorised printed text. Those moments of agreement where all other witnesses read against <italic>Hesperides</italic> might
<target target-type="page" id="page_241"/>be used to establish a text of the poem close to something Herrick had before he revised it for print, and then the readings of the authorised poem could serve to break the deadlock between any two lines of manuscript descent. In this case, the readings of &#x2018;shall&#x2019; in the Carew text would be rejected as non-authorial, since all other witnesses including <italic>Hesperides</italic> read &#x2018;must&#x2019; here.</p>
<p>However, the absence of any of Herrick&#x2019;s holographs from the tradition, the degree of conflation and sophistication in the surviving witnesses, and the evidence from other poems that Herrick does revise his texts meant that we found that the evidence cannot convincingly support the recovery of a single text reliably expressive of an <italic>original</italic> authorial intention that might sit alongside his final version of 1648. We can, however, identify a version that is a product of a specific intention. Lawes&#x2019;s autograph is the one closest to Herrick&#x2019;s final text, and there is strong and sustained evidence of mutual collaboration across other poems as well, which indicates the lyric-in-its-setting is an outcome intended by Herrick and Lawes at a particular point in the process. This selection introduces an alternative reading of the poem as a collaborative work, and as a song-text that needs to be interpreted within the history of English music in the late 1630s, a claim which tests and complicates the straightforwardly autobiographical reading privileged by the title Herrick uses in his <italic>Works</italic> and briefly recounted at the outset of this chapter. It also recognises (and the choice is legitimised by) the clear impulse towards the control of their texts that both Herrick and Lawes exercised in their publishing career in response to a set of manuscript and print practices which mitigated against their creative authority.</p>
<p>That choice continues to govern the tradition through an author-figure which suppresses a great deal of the text&#x2019;s history and privileges the inten tions of the author over the practices of the readers. A materialist-oriented approach offers a way of editing with those practices to the forefront. Again speaking in very general terms, the materialist model treats the document or documents on which the text has been transcribed as an irreducible aspect of its meaning. As a consequence all those involved in the creation of the document &#x2013; copyists, printers, publishers &#x2013; contribute to the creation of the text. As these agents change with each document created, all versions, all inscriptions of the text, become meaningful, and this necessitates the edition taking all such witnesses seriously. This irreducibility is the crucial distinguishing feature between the two approaches. There is no reason in principle why an intentionalist approach could not include the recovery or attempted recovery of the intentions of agents other than author-figures associated with the composition process. But inten -tionalist models are willing to observe a distinction between the text and the document that the materialist approach is not, and the latter&#x2019;s perspective on the text as document means that both text and edition are very different entities. This perspective lies behind Peter Robinson&#x2019;s recent proposed redefinition of the term &#x2018;work&#x2019;: &#x2018;In my formulation, the work is not apart from the document. The extant documents, the documents we reconstruct, the relation we uncover among the documents and all involved in their creation, transmission and reception, and the acts of communication we extract from them, are the work.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_65"><sup>65</sup></xref></p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_242"/>The text here is better described as a process of variance rather than a stable form, and the edition shifts from a history of how a text has been written to a history of how it has been and continues to be read. There is an obvious consonance between this mode of editing and May&#x2019;s concern (2.2.1) for the representation of a scribal context. The question is: to what extent can or should any author-centred print edition respond to these imperatives, since it is extremely difficult to reconcile these two imperatives within the confines of that editorial structure? While the <italic>Complete Poetry of Robert Herrick</italic> is by its very nomenclature an intentionalist edition, by producing a volume entitled &#x2018;manuscript poetry&#x2019; we as editors committed ourselves to the argument that the medium of original publication matters. What resulted is what Nicholas Halmi has summed up as the single experience shared by all editors, compromise.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_66"><sup>66</sup></xref> While their governing theory of the text will pull editors in one direction, the nature of the original material and the limitations of the medium of publication means those initial editorial ideals will undergo extensive revision. Halmi&#x2019;s remarks serve as a crucial reminder that editing exists in the doing, not the theorising.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Our solution</title>
<p>We edited two texts of &#x2018;Mistress Elizabeth Wheeler&#x2019; for Volume Two: the 26-line text found in Carew&#x2019;s <italic>Poems</italic> of 1640 and the text and 22-line setting found in Henry Lawes&#x2019; autograph manuscript. The rationale for the first is that it comprised the earliest text of what, on the basis of the evidence, we judged to be the complete poem, the 26-line version, though with the attendant irony that in a volume of nominally manuscript poetry, we were publishing a text that survives initially only in print. One advantage of this selection is that it exemplifies the porosity of the boundary between these two media which is such a marked feature of the textual tradition. The rationale for Lawes&#x2019;s autograph is that articulated above. We supplied the song in its setting and also in standalone format, organised according to the four-line stanza breaks used by both the Carew text and the text in <italic>Hesperides</italic>. Here we imposed print formatting on a manuscript text but (as with the Carew text) we retained the original spelling, capitalisation, and punctuation, regularising only u/v and i/j.</p>
<p>The editorial impulse here is clearly originary in the use of terms like &#x2018;earliest&#x2019; and &#x2018;complete&#x2019;, but the way of thinking about origins has extended beyond authorial intentions. Since Lawes&#x2019;s text, like Carew&#x2019;s, also served to begin a renewed cycle of copying in the work&#x2019;s history, both are crucial to understanding both the scribal and authorial tradition of the work. The decision that sought to find in a single historical document the &#x2018;best&#x2019; repre -sentative of a particular tradition of the poem and the decision to retain original spelling, punctuation, and orthography signals a materialist commit ment to the meaningfulness of the text as it is inscribed and laid out in that document, while the editing of more than one version of the poem acknow ledges, in however attenuated a fashion, that such integrity does not last beyond the individual inscription.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_243"/>The accompanying textual introduction expands on that latter point. It lists all surviving print and MS witnesses, notes reissues of the print witnesses, and the narrative seeks to produce in a compressed and synoptic form the history of the &#x2018;work&#x2019; essentially on the same terms as Robinson defines it, though within the chronological boundaries of the seventeenth century. This compressed route is unsatisfactory in one sense for not being comprehensive enough for a materialist edition; in another for being far too comprehensive for an intentionalist one. Why might we &#x2018;need&#x2019; to know what John Playford did with Herrick&#x2019;s poem and Lawes&#x2019;s setting? What reading of Herrick&#x2019;s <italic>oeuvre</italic> does it serve?</p>
<p>One answer is that Volume Two as a whole functions in dialogue with the authorised print tradition of Herrick&#x2019;s poetry, established by Herrick&#x2019;s own emphatic appropriation of all these poems under the term <italic>Works</italic>, the first vol -ume of poetry in English literary history to be so called.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_67"><sup>67</sup></xref> This gesture of possession is encoded in Volume One of our edition through the presentation of the poems prefaced by a biography of the poet. Volume Two tests the claims of poet-centred authority made in Volume One by exposing and documenting the traditions of copying and publishing which are submerged by <italic>Hesperides</italic>&#x2019; self-confident authority and illustrates the social influences that shape the composition and reception of what appears to be one of the most auto -biographical and personal poems in the 1402-poem collection. All the witnesses are of course selected because they represent a poem by Robert Herrick, and the edition insists on that identity as compre hensively as early modern textual practices elided it. But its account of what Robinson calls the &#x2018;work&#x2019; exposes the implications and the contingency of Herrick&#x2019;s &#x2013; and indeed our &#x2013; gesture in shaping that work as his <italic>Works</italic>.</p>
<p>Another answer which could be offered, of course, is the digital edition. Our editing is clearly shaped by the material of our medium: print demands selection and hierarchy. The print edition best serves an intentionalist mode. However, rather than seeing the complexities and compromises entailed in terms of presenting a manuscript tradition within a print edition eliminated by a switch to the digital, I suggest instead that they are instructive for thinking about how the materiality of the digital and the user-assumptions which accompany it will shape future editions. Digital editions have always had an affinity with materialist-oriented editing. There is a natural coher ence for example between Robinson&#x2019;s definition of the &#x2018;work&#x2019; and Paul Eggert&#x2019;s model of the digital edition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_68"><sup>68</sup></xref> Eggert, who prefers the term &#x2018;critical archive&#x2019; to critical edition, argues that these sites should be designed ideally to record &#x2018;the successive sets of interactions carried out and recorded by its users&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_69"><sup>69</sup></xref> In this framework, the ideal digital edition of an early modern tradition should be one that not only records the critical interventions in the text made by its early modern readers but by its modern readers as well &#x2013; indeed understands those interventions as part of the &#x2018;work&#x2019; itself: &#x2018;Their work would become part of the work of the always unravelling life of the work that is the subject of the edition.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_70"><sup>70</sup></xref> Eggert&#x2019;s formulation proposes an intellectually coherent and com -pelling model for materialist-oriented editions where the edition&#x2019;s principles
<target target-type="page" id="page_244"/>consistently coincide with both its practice and the user-expectations created by the semantic web. An end to compromise is in sight.</p>
<p>However, Andrew Prescott has commented that &#x2018;[i]t is striking how digital projects are often bound by the very old-fashioned structure of the edition&#x2019; noting how &#x2018;the data is safely locked away behind a web interface which makes the data almost as intractable as if it was printed.&#x2019;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_71"><sup>71</sup></xref> Prescott&#x2019;s reminder that the edition as we know it is medium-specific alerts us to the fact that digital editors also need to theorise how the online environment shapes or should shape the materials published on it. The nature of the digital medium in fact requires a negotiation of the same conflicts I have just described between a manuscript tradition and a modern print edition, but this time between the pressures of a codex-oriented approach to the text and the demand that digitally oriented editions respond to the expectations and capacities of a digital environment rather than continuing to think with print.</p>
<p>But while the tensions I have described can be highly frustrating experiences, they are also productive and central to the editing process. Grappling with the limitations and expectations of a medium means the editor must make an argument about what the text is and how it should be represented, and must grasp more acutely the nature of the claims s/he makes in the act of editing. Put more succinctly, it requires that s/he perform the actions that make an edition an edition.</p>

<title>Commentary as intellectual history: sources versus conversations</title>
<p>As co-editor of Thomas Browne&#x2019;s <italic>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</italic> for the new <italic>Complete Works of Thomas Browne</italic> to be published by Oxford University Press under the general editorship of Claire Preston, I am writing com mentary. A lot of commentary: around three pages of it for each page of text, as well as headnotes to each chapter and book that will provide a broader and more rudimentary introduction for readers reluctant to wade through what may, ultimately, amount to 1,500 pages of commentary for a 600-page text. Since beginning work on the edition a year ago, during which time I have commented on Book 2 and portions of Book 3, I have also spent quite a bit of time thinking about how to justify producing such an extensive commentary on the work &#x2013; not to our press, which has not imposed any word limits &#x2013; but rather to readers unaccustomed to this volume of commentary, as well as perhaps to scholarly editors downright suspicious of it. This essay lays out a rationale for a copious model of commentary that licences annotations to partake in the work of
<target target-type="page" id="page_245"/>intellectual history. My goal is also to assist other scholarly editors in ascertaining when, and under what circumstances, lengthy commentary might be intellectually legitimate or desirable.</p>
<p>I am firmly committed to the principle &#x2013; as W. Speed Hill put it in 1973 &#x2013; that &#x2018;[a]nnotation ought to be factual, objective, verifiable, noncontro versial&#x2019;. But I am equally committed to his 1997 qualification of that claim: &#x2018;it would be a sad victory if textual immortality were purchased at the price of interpretive silence&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_72"><sup>72</sup></xref> When scholarly editors have an opportunity to generate new know ledge &#x2013; not just of textual variants or the provenance of a manu script, but also of larger intellectual and literary currents &#x2013; they should not instinctively censor themselves for fear that the resulting editions will be too bulky, too erudite, or even, in certain cases, too interpretive. Even Thomas Tanselle, a beacon of caution in editorial practice, conceded that it is a &#x2018;delusion&#x2019; to think that textual scholarship is prehermeneutic, that it &#x2018;merely prepares the way for scholarly criticism and is not itself part of the critical process&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_73"><sup>73</sup></xref> This is particularly true, I think, for understudied texts or ones that display a wide-ranging engagement with key intellectual issues, and the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> qualifies on both counts. The last three decades have seen the partial erosion of that once-unwavering commitment to &#x2018;the text itself&#x2019;, once the hallmark of the New Bibliography and its faithful com panion, the New Criticism. While that commitment will be honored, from a material standpoint, by our edition, with all editorial apparatus appearing at the end of the text, rather than at the bottom of the page, it will not be honored in the commentary.</p>
<p>My primary aim as annotator is still to provide basic guidance: identifying proper names, glossing obscure terms, identifying sources and analogues for cited passages, and cross-referencing terms and ideas across Browne&#x2019;s <italic>&#x0153;uvre</italic>. But what compelled me to undertake the edition in the first place was the opportunity to immerse myself in the book&#x2019;s many subjects, in Browne&#x2019;s other writings, and in seventeenth-century intellectual culture. I see little reason not to share the profits of that undertaking with readers who (I hope) will use the commentary to generate new scholarship on Browne or on various matters treated by the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic>, ranging from electrical effluvia to Egyptian hiero -glyphics. Three decades ago, Jerome McGann wisely called upon scholarly editors to help repair the rift between the practices of textual editing and of literary (or &#x2018;hermeneutic&#x2019;) scholarship.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_74"><sup>74</sup></xref> The best way a scholarly edition can do this, I think, is to provide readers with a <italic>readerly</italic> edition, one that opens up new avenues for scholarly investigation and revitalises the study of a text by making it both more usable and more exciting.</p>
<p>There are three principal justifications for the decision to produce a lengthy and richly contextual commentary. First, the encyclop&#x00E6;dic nature of the text we are editing. The <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> deals with matters of theology and epistem -ology, biblical chronology and hermeneutics, mineralogy, botany, physiology, anthropology, and iconography. Few readers will have expertise in all these fields, and it is tricky to assume too much shared or common knowledge among what I imagine will be a wide range of readers consulting the text for various reasons. I have thus glossed concepts (such as &#x2018;saving appearances&#x2019; or &#x2018;Lacteal vessels&#x2019; or &#x2018;Signaturists&#x2019;) that might be quite familiar to students of early
<target target-type="page" id="page_246"/>modern natural philosophy or medicine but not necessarily to literary scholars, and conversely have annotated passages where matters of style might shape (or ambiguate) meaning, to assist those readers unaccustomed to reading &#x2018;scien -tific&#x2019; texts as rhetorically complex and inventive as Browne&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>Second, I am drafting more extensive commentary than what one usually finds in an Oxford English text because of the changing nature of scholarly research: electronic databases such as <italic>Early English Books Online</italic> and <italic>Early European Books Online</italic>, <italic>Gallica</italic>, and <italic>e-Rara</italic>, yield many more possible sources and analogues than any annotator, howsoever steeped in her/his subject, could manage to identify working with printed materials alone, and they do so much more quickly, albeit imperfectly, a problem I don&#x2019;t have space to address here. Although the digital edition of our text is presently slated to be a facsimile of the print edition (OUP&#x2019;s current practice, but one subject to change given the rapid development of new digital platforms), we are still producing that text in a post-digital age, and with the digitisation of scholar ship and primary resources, annotational practices (or at least annotational possibilities) have been transformed not just by collaborative software that allows for real-time editing, but also by the profusion of easily accessible, searchable primary materials. For his 1981 Clarendon edition, Robin Robbins spent two decades amassing all the texts listed in the Sales Catalogue of the Browne family in the hopes of reconstructing the library at Browne&#x2019;s disposal while he was writing the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic>. I can download a dozen early modern treatises on ornithology in a half-hour, and in one minute, I can search more than a hundred thousand English Renaissance texts for the word &#x2018;incrassation&#x2019;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_75"><sup>75</sup></xref> So, for that matter, can most current and future readers of the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic>, which is why I am extremely selective about what I do include, curating a massive digital and print archive into something more digestible.</p>
<p>Third, I am providing lengthier annotations than have previous editors of the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> (Simon Wilkin, Geoffrey Keynes, and Robin Robbins) because I believe our understanding of the text&#x2019;s composition and reception, and its place in the history of seventeenth-century thought, will expand greatly if the commentary and introduction take pains to place Browne in dialogue with other writers of his era who are asking similar questions or share similar pre -occupations. In brief, the annotations aim to reveal not simply Browne&#x2019;s <italic>sources</italic> &#x2013; from which books he drew his material &#x2013; but also the <italic>conversations</italic> taking place both around the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> and through it. It&#x2019;s worth noting that Browne does not reliably identify the sources from which he cites his material: he regularly quotes both classical and post-classical authorities second-hand, and on occasion does not identify at all the origin of material extracted from somewhere else. This has prompted me, in many cases, to favour listing multiple possible &#x2018;sources&#x2019; rather than one exclusive one, a practice that also helps to demonstrate the din of a given conversation or debate. It&#x2019;s also worth noting that the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> was enormously popular with seventeenth-century English and European readers, who annotated their copies of the work copiously and occasionally wrote whole commentaries on it. A text that did not garner so much attention from readers in its own era might not require an equally wide sweep in the commentary, which aims to chart the ways that the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> generated
<target target-type="page" id="page_247"/>conversations, and (through Browne&#x2019;s substantive revisions) participated in them, during and shortly after its first six appearances in print (1646&#x2013;72).</p>
<p>In charting these conversations, I have been especially attentive to the writers with whom Browne was in fact conversant (Kenelm Digby, John Evelyn, Henry Power) and to those he cites with great frequency or admiration (William Gilbert, Athanius Kircher, Ulisse Aldrovandi, Carolus Clusius). But many annotations also offer references to works that do not appear in the Sales Catalogue (SC), as well as to works that postdate the drafting of the relevant passage in the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> but that nonetheless speak to the same questions addressed by Browne. These include a number of annota tions designed to illustrate the impact that the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> had on later seventeenth-century readers, in particular early members of the Royal Society (such as George Ent, Robert Hooke, and Robert Boyle) who were performing experiments throughout the 1660s and early 1670s on many of the same scientific questions raised by Browne&#x2019;s work, especially those reflected in his 1672 additions to the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic>. The effect, I hope, will be to demonstrate the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic>&#x2019;s central and active participation in key debates over matters ranging from the interpretation of scripture to theories of generation or digestion. I also strive to guide readers not only to other texts consonant with Browne&#x2019;s own claims, or those that might have provided his source-material, but also to the many subjects tackled by Browne about which there was lively disagreement at the time. To name but a few: what was sperma coeti? Are minerals alive? Is coral a plant or a stone? Do plants have sexes? These were questions that fascinated seventeenth-century scholars; they are also questions that will grip readers now and in the future.</p>
<p>What follows are some examples of passages I&#x2019;ve worked on in the <italic>Pseudodoxi</italic>a where I think copious annotation is warranted by the com plexity of the material or the scope of the underlying issues the passage raises. My first example concerns Browne&#x2019;s citation of Job 26.7 in a chapter on magnetism:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . as when it is said by Job, <italic>Extendit Aquilonem super vacuo</italic>, etc. Hee stretcheth forth the North upon the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing (2.2, 87).</p>
<p>Wilkin and Keynes simply print Browne&#x2019;s own marginal note, added in 1650 (&#x2018;Job 26.&#x2019;). Robbins also includes the verse number, and he notes that the same verse is cited in Bacon&#x2019;s <italic>Advancement of Learning</italic>. My note goes a step further:
<disp-quote>
<p>(Job 26.7): &#x2018;He stretcheth out the North over the emptie place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing,&#x2019; also cited by Bacon, <italic>Adv. Learning</italic> 1.6.2 (SC, 1640), p. 44, to illustrate how the verse, &#x2018;if it be revolved with diligence. . . will be found pregnant, and swelling with naturall Philosophie&#x2019;. Edward Leigh, <italic>Annotations on five poetical books of the Old Testament</italic> (1657), p. 16, glosses the verse as indicating that &#x2018;the earth hangeth on nothing, but the mighty and powerfull word of God&#x2019;. Arthur Jackson, <italic>Annotations upon the five books immediately following the historicall part of the Old Testament</italic> (1658), p. 602, observes in his gloss &#x2018;that the world by the supporting providence of God is firmly settled, according as it was first established by the law of creation&#x2019;. See also Vallesius, <italic>Sacra Philosophia</italic></p>
<target target-type="page" id="page_248"/>
<p>59 (1600), pp. 343&#x2013;4, citing Psalm 92.1 and Job 26.7 side by side to testify to the immobility of the earth.</p>
<p>My purpose here, in providing a more wide-angle context, is to illustrate how pivotal this particular verse from Job was for seventeenth-century natural philosophers and theologians alike as they struggled to reconcile the book of nature and of scripture in light of new astronomical discoveries, particularly those of Copernicus and Galileo. In the very same paragraph, in the second 1650 edition of the <italic>Pseudodoxi</italic>a, Browne removes a passage that (in &#x2018;46) voiced his suspended judgement on the question of whether the earth moves or stands still. By &#x2018;50, he appears more certain of the earth&#x2019;s &#x2018;Magneticall stability&#x2019;. Vallesius&#x2019;s citation of the verse is particularly suggestive, I think, because it resembles Browne&#x2019;s own use of Job 26.7 (and Browne owned the 1622 edition of Vallesius&#x2019;s work).</p>
<p>There are many other instances where providing insight into the seventeenth-century usage for a classical or biblical citation enhances our understanding of what the cited passage might mean at a particular intellectual moment. When Browne refers to Archimedes&#x2019; attempt to &#x2018;write the number of the sands&#x2019; (<ITALIC>PE</ITALIC> 2.7), it might be useful for some readers to know how this project was reanimated in the 1650s by Walter Charleton&#x2019;s attempt to calculate the number of atoms in the universe, or how often seventeenth-century allusions to Archimedes&#x2019;s Arenarius are paired with or &#x2018;glossed&#x2019; by an allusion to Matt. 13.31 (&#x2018;The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed&#x2019;). These details might seem irrelevant were I editing a different sort of work. Yet seeds and grains fascinated Browne, as did other small forms, and he was, in certain respects, a deeply associative thinker, the kind whose mind moved easily from insects to or atoms, or dust, or mustard seeds. The note invites readers to consider his invocation of Archimedes&#x2019;s <italic>Sand Reckoner</italic> in light of the seventeenth-century revival of atomism and also, perhaps, to ponder the odd sympathies between an ancient Greek mathematical problem and a biblical parable dear to Browne and his age.</p>
<p>My next example concerns Browne&#x2019;s discussion of Solomon&#x2019;s sea voyage &#x2018;from Eziongeber in the read Sea unto Ophir, which is supposed to be Taprobana or Malaca in the Indies&#x2019; (2.2, 97). Robbins, alone among the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic>&#x2019;s editors in annotating the passage at all, sends the reader to two early modern Latin texts that make the same claim (and there are many more that could be cited). But I find it more thought-provoking &#x2013; in part because I&#x2019;m editing a text that is about the production of error and the deficiencies of the human intellect, and in part because Browne was so fascinated by imagin -ary places &#x2013; to provide the following note:
<disp-quote>
<p>Taprobana, or Taprobane, is the historical name for an island identified by Ptolemy with Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) or located at the eastern edges of the known world (Pliny, HN 6.24) but in the 16th and 17th cs. more commonly situated in the Indonesian archipelago. Carpenter, <italic>Geographie</italic> (SC, 1635), p. 158 situates Taprobana near the &#x2018;Molucco Ilands&#x2019; in Indonesia; compare Pietro Martire d&#x2019;Anghiera, <italic>Decades</italic> (1555), p. 231, Acosta<italic>, Indies</italic> (1604), pp. 37; 55, and Blundeville, <italic>A briefe description of</italic></p>
<target target-type="page" id="page_249"/>
<p><italic>universal mappes and cardes</italic> (1589), p. 12, who all identify Taprobana as Sumatra. The island commonly features in early modern litera ture as a Utopian or imaginary kingdom: see Lu&#x00ED;s de Cam&#x00F5;es, <italic>Os Lus&#x00ED;adas</italic> 1.1; Miguel de Cervantes, <italic>Don Quixote</italic>, 1.18, and Tommaso Campanella, <italic>La citt&#x00E0; del sole</italic> (1623), whose ideal, Solarian city is located in Taprobana.</p>
<p>This note not only illustrates lively disagreement concerning the location of Taprobana but also provides a suggestive avenue for further research, especially for scholars interested in utopian spaces (such as Browne&#x2019;s own <italic>Mus&#x00E6;um Clausum</italic>). The note also favours more accessible English sources over Latin ones, a strategy I am adhering to in the many places where I find an abundance of reasonably likely sources for a particular fact or idea.</p>
<p>Our edition of the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> will be attentive to the work&#x2019;s early reception in a variety of ways, including annotations that emphasise Browne&#x2019;s participation in a larger community of scholars that included many of the founding members of the Royal Society. In <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> 2.7, devoted largely to insects, there are several pieces of striking evidence that Browne&#x2019;s investi -gations in sections of the chapter added only in &#x2018;72 match up with those undertaken around the same time by the Royal Society. Browne&#x2019;s discussion of the &#x2018;Dead-watch&#x2019; insect is added to the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> a decade after George Ent was asked by his fellow Royal Society members to &#x2018;bring in at the next meeting his box of little animals, which make a noise, called the death-watch&#x2019; (<ITALIC>PE</ITALIC> 2.7; Birch, <ITALIC>RS</ITALIC> 1.84), and both sets of investigations led to similar con -clusions about the source and purpose of the insect&#x2019;s ticking sound. Dispensing with another superstition later in the same chapter, Browne mentions a strange rain, &#x2018;almost preached for Wheat&#x2019; but in fact &#x2018;but the seed of Ivy-berries&#x2019;, the very same conclusion reached by Col. Samuel Tuke, a friend of Browne&#x2019;s who undertook an investigation into a &#x2018;rain like corn&#x2019; that fell near Norwich in May 1661. According to Birch (<ITALIC>RS</ITALIC> 1.25&#x2013;33), Boyle and Evelyn asked Tuke for more seeds to examine; Tuke ultimately delivered a report, concluding that the grains were in fact the remnants of ivy berries eaten and then cast away by starlings. A similar investigation took place in 1667, with a similar conclusion. While we cannot know which direction the influence moved in cases like these &#x2013; Tuke might have enlisted Browne&#x2019;s help in studying the berries, or Browne might have learned about Tuke&#x2019;s investigations from Tuke himself, from Tuke&#x2019;s cousin, John Evelyn, or from his own son Edward, among others &#x2013; the annotations illustrate the overlapping interests of Browne and the Royal Society, particu -larly on matters botanical and entomological. Such annotations help to situate the Norwich-based Browne (and especially his revisions to the &#x2018;72 <ITALIC>PE</ITALIC>) less peripherally with respect to scientific activity in London.</p>
<p>Browne published the first edition of the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> in the fifth and final year of the first English Civil war and revised it twice (&#x2018;50, &#x201C;58) over the course of the next dozen, tumultuous years. Scholars have long puzzled over whether to regard the <ITALIC>PE</ITALIC> as a specimen of the &#x2018;literature of retreat&#x2019; and how to make sense of the work&#x2019;s apparent disengagement with current events, since it contains few (if any) overt references in it to the war or to the underlying political and religious debates fuelling it. Yet there are <italic>plenty</italic> of oblique
<target target-type="page" id="page_250"/>references to the Civil War, and a more copious style of annotation allows many glimpses into Browne&#x2019;s indirect or implied engagement with contemporary events. For instance, Browne&#x2019;s discussion of <italic>Ferrum equinum</italic>, a plant believed to possess the magnetic power to &#x2018;draw off the shoes of a Horse that passeth over it&#x2019;, is printed in 1646, only one year after a Civil War battle at White Down, near Tiverton, at which the horses belonging to the Earl of Essex&#x2019;s Royalist troops were reported to have lost their shoes because of the <italic>Ferrum</italic> or horseshoe vetch on the heath, and reports of this portentous event were common in the years that followed (<ITALIC>PE</ITALIC> 2.6.5). In a similar vein, Browne&#x2019;s scepticism about the supposedly magnetic tomb of Mahomet, which hangs &#x2018;in the air between two Loadstones artificially contrived&#x2019; may have had very specific political implications in the 1640s, especially since other skeptics of the marvelous spectacle deem it a ruse that a tyrannical ruler constructed to deceive his subjects, and the tomb is even more explicitly intricated in debates over political authority when invoked by King Charles I, whose <italic>Eikon Basilike</italic> asks for the &#x2018;Majesty of the Kings of England&#x2019; to &#x2018;hang like Mahomets Tomb, by a magnetique Charme . . . in an aery imagination of Regality&#x2019; (<ITALIC>PE</ITALIC> 2.3; <italic>Eikon Basilike</italic> [London, 1648], 68). The note in no way suggests that Browne&#x2019;s disdain for the tomb, or the myths surrounding it, is explicitly motivated by political concerns, nor does it posit a debt to Browne on the part of Charles. But after examining dozens of accounts of the tomb by writers from around 1600 up to 1646, I found that few of them had responses to it that didn&#x2019;t in some way connect the marvel to the power of political spectacle, either in the Islamic world, in England, or both.</p>
<p>Even sparsely annotated texts usually strive to cross-reference passages in a given work with other, similar passages in the author&#x2019;s other published and unpublished works. In Browne&#x2019;s case, this practice encourages copious ness, not simply because he returned compulsively to certain philosophical and theological questions throughout his life, but also because his tendency to investigate latent patterns in nature prompts him to &#x2018;transplant&#x2019; concepts from one discipline or context to another. For example: in a discussion of whether the badger has longer legs on one side of his body than on the other, Browne uses the phrase &#x2018;Diagoniall movers&#x2019;, a reference to Aristotle, <italic>De Incessu Animalium</italic> 6 [707a11&#x2013;12], which describes animal locomotion as consisting in the alternating motion of &#x2018;pairs arranged coordinately or diagonally [&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C7;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C2;]&#x2019; (<ITALIC>PE</ITALIC> 3.5). This is the very same pattern Browne later finds in the &#x2018;decussated&#x2019; or quincuntial garden plots of the <italic>Garden of Cyrus</italic>, whose &#x2018;Diagonall lines&#x2019; Browne likens to the &#x2018;legges of Quadrupeds when they goe&#x2019; (<italic>Garden of Cyrus</italic> [London, 1658], 95, 128). Cross-referencing a passage about animal locomotion with one about the planting of trees might seem an interpretive stretch &#x2013; but not when editing Browne, the kind of thinker who frequently made such associative leaps and was eager to understand whether such analogies were rooted in natural causes (or divine motives) or in what he calls an &#x2018;assimilating phancy&#x2019; (<ITALIC>PE</ITALIC> 2.6.1).</p>
<p>Finally, I have enlarged upon the usual editorial practice of glossing difficult words and coinages (both abundant in the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic>) by choosing also to gloss terms that are evolving in the middle of the seventeenth century as well as those whose meanings are less obvious, on close inspection, than they might
<target target-type="page" id="page_251"/>initially appear. These include terms such as &#x2018;gravity&#x2019;, whose meaning changes radically over the course of the century, or &#x2018;real&#x2019;, a term whose basic meaning may be apparent to all readers, but not its complex Platonic heritage. They also include terms such as &#x2018;paradox&#x2019;, at least when that term appears in an odd context such as the opening sentence of <ITALIC>PE</ITALIC> 2.3, which claims that magnetism is &#x2018;not only a simple Heterodox&#x2019; but also a &#x2018;very hard Paradox&#x2019;. Here is my note:
<disp-quote>
<p>Heterodox. . . Paradox] If heterodoxy is &#x2018;simple&#x2019; disagreement with established doctrine or opinion, or the maintenance of an opinion that conflicts with what is generally accepted as true, then paradoxy is &#x2018;hard&#x2019; for B. because it runs contrary to received opinion and also proves difficult to believe; paradoxes seem at first glance absurd, self-contradictory, or counter-intuitive. See <ITALIC>RM</ITALIC> 1.6: &#x2018;In Philosophy where truth seemes double-faced, there is no man more paradoxicall then myself&#x2019;. Magnetism is paradoxical for B. because it is a marvel whose causes are not immediately apparent; at <ITALIC>PE</ITALIC> 7.17 B. mentions magnetic and electrical attraction as phenomena that would seem unbelievable to those who had never seen them. These phenomena, for B., conform with those discussed by Augustine, <italic>City of God</italic> 21.5 (1620), p. 789, marvels that &#x2018;are so common, and yet exceed all reason, and seeme to oppose the lawes of nature&#x2019;. Magnetism is also &#x2018;double-faced&#x2019; or para doxical for B. because, while the loadstone is described as appearing to &#x2018;draw&#x2019; or attract iron, in truth both metals simultaneously affect each other. The final section (pp. 144&#x2013;64) of <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="part1">part 1</xref> of Kircher&#x2019;s 1641 <italic>Magnes, sive De Arte Magnetica</italic>, a work referred to extensively by B. throughout <ITALIC>PE</ITALIC> 2.3, is devoted to paradoxes concerning magnetism, a phenomenon that Kircher considers &#x2018;paradoxical&#x2019; because it appears to involve two contrary yet simultaneous motions, attraction and repulsion.</p>
<p>This is, admittedly, more than some readers will want. But the rich intel -lectual and theological contexts of Browne&#x2019;s claim that magnetism is a &#x2018;hard paradox&#x2019; do warrant this degree of intervention, I think, especially if the comment stimulates readers to bring fresh eyes to Browne&#x2019;s more well-known declaration of himself as &#x2018;paradoxical&#x2019; in <italic>Religio Medici</italic>, or even to the Renaissance &#x2018;epidemic&#x2019; of paradox more generally.</p>
<p>Despite the longstanding tradition of annotating Renaissance verse more copiously than its prose, Browne&#x2019;s <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> is &#x2013; like the prose writings of Rabelais and Burton &#x2013; a work so wide-ranging and, often, so arcane in its learning that it demands a more abundant commentary than has been produced thus far. Given the wide range of readers likely to consult a new edition of the <italic>Pseudodoxia</italic> &#x2013; literary scholars but also historians of medicine, religion, and philosophy, among others &#x2013; our edition must attend to readers who may find themselves wading through unfamiliar territory at every turn, as well as to those who wish to learn more not just about the work&#x2019;s classical, scriptural, and patristic sources but also about its active participation in the shaping of seventeenth-century philosophical, hermeneutic, and scientific debates.</p>
