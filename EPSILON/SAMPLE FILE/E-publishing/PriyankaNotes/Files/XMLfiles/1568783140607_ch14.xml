<title>Radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>The boundaries of the canine and feline thoracic cavity consist of the thoracic skeleton, the cranial and caudal thoracic apertures and the covering soft tissue structures. The rib cage is covered by thoracic, pectoral, spinal and other musculature, subcutaneous fat and skin, and serves as an attachment for the thoracic extremities.</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cranial thoracic aperture</title>
<p>The cranial thoracic aperture (also known as the thoracic inlet) is a small passage for the trachea, oesophagus, vessels and nerves. It is enclosed by the deep fascia as well as the pectoral, scalenius and longus colli muscles. Radiographically, it is synonymous with the area between the first pair of ribs.</p>
<p>The right pleural cupula normally extends to the level of the first rib in the dog (both cupula extend to this level in cats; see Figure 12.1, p. 242). The left pleural cupula extends slightly further cranially in full inspiration in the dog (see Figures 12.1c, p. 242 and 12.2, p. 243).</p>
<p>The thoracic inlet serves as a reference for radiographic tracheal diameter measurements (see Figure 10.3, p. 214) and a tangential radiographic view into the inlet can be used for assessment of tracheal collapse (see Figure 10.13, p. 218). Occasionally, it is used as an ultrasonographic approach for the cranial mediastinum.</p>
</sec2>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Thoracic skeleton</title>
<p>The thoracic skeleton consists of the ribs, sternum and thoracic spine.</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ribs</title>
<p>Dogs and cats normally have 13 pairs of ribs, which have the following characteristics:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Flat surface in dogs, cylindrical in cats</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contour:

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><label>&#x2013;</label><p>Evenly curved (barrel-chested dog breeds, cylindrical-shaped feline thorax)</p></list-item>

</list>
</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consist of a large bony dorsal and small cartilaginous ventral portion (costal cartilage)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The dorsal extremity of the rib consists of a head, neck and tubercle</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Two synovial joints between the rib and the spine:

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><label>&#x2013;</label><p>Costovertebral joint between the rib head and the costal vertebral facet (hinge joint)</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>&#x2013;</label><p>Costotransverse joint between the tubercle and the transverse process of the vertebra (sliding joint).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Costochondral junction between the osseous and cartilaginous part of the rib</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Synovial sternocostal joints for the first eight to nine ribs (sternal ribs), remaining ribs fused by connective tissue to each other and the last sternal rib to form the costal arch (asternal or false ribs)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Last one (dogs) or two (cats) pair(s) of ribs not connected to the costal arch (floating ribs).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
</sec3>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Sternum</title>
<p>The sternum consists of a series of eight bones that form the floor of the thorax. The most cranial sternebra is called the manubrium, and the most caudal sternebra is the xiphoid process. The xiphoid cartilage prolongs the xiphoid process caudally. The individual sternebrae are joined by intersternebral cartilage. The first nine ribs articulate with the sternum through the costal cartilages.</p>
<p>Dogs have a curved sternum, which is square in cross section; cats have a cylindrical straight sternum with a flat xiphoid process. The sternum rotates outward in inspiration with the anchor point at the manubrium. The respiratory excursion is higher in cats (3&#x2013;5 degrees) than in dogs (1 degree in the German Shepherd Dog).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Thoracic spine</title>
<p>Dogs and cats usually have 13 thoracic vertebrae, which articulate cranially with a corresponding rib pair. The cranial nine thoracic vertebrae share the following features:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Short bodies with flattened extremities</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Flat articular facets</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Closely fitting vertebral arches</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Long spinous processes with converging orientation. Eleventh, or occasionally tenth, thoracic vertebra is closest to dorsoventral orientation (anticlinal vertebra)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small transverse process bearing the costal facets for articulation with the ribs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the caudal thoracic spine, the mamillary and accessory processes emerge from the transverse process and diverge in opposite directions (Figure 14.1)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Species and breed differences:

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><label>&#x2013;</label><p>Vertebral body shape in cats is more cylindrical than in dogs</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>&#x2013;</label><p>Spinal arrangement is physiologically more flexible in cats (curving)</p></list-item>

<title>Caudal thoracic aperture and diaphragm</title>
<p>The diaphragm is a dome-shaped musculotendinous organ that attaches to the costal arch and covers the caudal thoracic aperture. It develops from six embryogenic segments into two muscular masses, the crura diaphragmatica, and a central collagenous tendon. The normal adult diaphragm has three openings:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Dorsal aortic hiatus (for aorta, azygos vein and thoracic duct)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Central oesophageal hiatus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dextroventral caval foramen (for caudal vena cava, CdVC).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>

<p>The diaphragm is normally only radiographically visible as an interface between the air-filled lungs and the combined soft tissue opacity of the diaphragm and liver. In obese dogs and most cats, the ventral diaphragm is visible in lateral radiographs as a narrow, soft tissue band between the falciform and retrosternal fat (or caudoventral lung margins) (Figure 14.2). The dorsal portion of the crura diaphragmatica attaches to the ventral surfaces of the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. At this junction the diaphragm forms the lumbodiaphragmatic recess.</p>
<p>The diaphragmatic silhouette has a variable appearance on the different radiographic views (see Figures 1.27, p. 17 and 1.29, p. 18):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>On the lateral view, the tendinous dome is projected cranioventrally and the two crura are projected caudodorsally</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On the ventrodorsal (VD) view, the tendinous dome is projected most cranially with the peak of the dome slightly to the right of midline. Both crura are positioned laterally</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On the dorsoventral (DV) view, only the dome is radiographically visible</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The right crus is positioned cranially to the left crus in right lateral recumbency, and <italic>vice versa</italic> in left lateral recumbency. This is due to the weight of the abdominal organs pushing more on the dependent crus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The right crus can be easily identified radiographically because the CdVC enters the thoracic cavity via the caval foramen through the right crus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The left crus is often underlined by the gas-filled fundus of the stomach</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In right lateral recumbency, the two diaphragmatic crura tend to run parallel; whereas they are usually converging ventrally in left lateral recumbency.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<fig14.2/>
<p>The diaphragm forms several recesses where it attaches to the thoracic wall: the dorsal, ventral, right and left costodiaphragmatic recesses. The right and left costodiaphragmatic recesses are located at the same level on both sides (see Figure 1.27, p. 17). On DV/VD views, the point where the projection of the caudal mediastinum joins the shadow of the diaphragm also forms an angle, referred to as the cardiodiaphragmatic angle (see Figure 1.29, p. 18).</p>
<p>Conventional radiography displays the diaphragmatic position only at the precise moment of the exposure. Fluoroscopy allows dynamic assessment of the diaphragm during inspiration and expiration.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Functional aspects of the thoracic boundaries</title>
<p>The thoracic boundaries are constructed to protect the thoracic viscera, yet allow the respiratory expansion of the lungs. During inspiration the diaphragm contracts, resulting in a flattening of its contour. There is opening of the lumbodiaphragmatic and costodiaphragmatic recesses. The diaphragm is the main contributor to inspiratory chest expansion. Contraction of the inspiratory muscles contributes to chest expansion via:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Outward rotation of the ribs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Slight ventral angulation of the sternum</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>First rib pair is fixated by scalenius muscles and thereby acts as an anchor point for rib cage movement.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>During expiration there is passive relaxation of diaphragm, resulting in its dome-shaped cranial contour, and relaxation of the inspiratory muscles. Expiration can be enhanced by contraction of the expiratory thoracic and abdominal musculature. There are slight differences in the functional anatomy of the rib cage in dogs and cats, which are outlined in Figure 14.3.</p>

<title>Thoracic skeleton</title>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ribs</title>
<p>The ribs are often overlooked or not carefully scrutinized during thoracic radiographic assessment. Their small individual size and abundant number, combined with low-contrast chest radiographic technique, makes them blend in with other thoracic structures. To avoid distraction from other thoracic organs, it is useful to evaluate the ribs with the radiograph in a non-standard orientation (see Figure 1.21, p. 14). Assessment of the ribs should be based on the classic R&#x00F6;ntgen signs.</p>
<fig14.3/>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Number, location and symmetry:</title>
<p>It is important to count the ribs when assessing them. If there are rib abnormalities, it is important to know which particular rib is affected:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Monostotic rib lesions are suggestive of primary rib neoplasia, osteomyelitis or focal trauma</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Polyostotic rib lesions are suggestive of trauma, osteochondromatosis, osteomyelitis (bite wounds, migrating foreign body), or underlying metastatic or metabolic disease.</p></list-item>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Soft tissues of the thoracic wall</title>
<p>The soft tissue mantle of the rib cage should be thin and even. Skin folds are common in many dog breeds, and are particularly prominent in Shar Peis (Figure 14.8). They can cast a disturbing pattern of lucencies and opacities over the entire thorax. Skin folds should be differentiated from intrathoracic pathology; skin folds extend beyond the thoracic margins. They can give rise to a false appearance of pneumothorax (pseudopneumothorax) (see Chapter 13).</p>
<p>Subcutaneous emphysema is a common sequel to neck and chest wall injuries (Figure 14.9) and displays a pattern of dispersed lucencies over the thorax, which could be misinterpreted as lung pathology. Two views and careful examination of the soft tissues with an intense light source will aid in differentiation:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Usually extends beyond the chest wall margin</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can be localized to skin via an orthogonal view.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>A wet haircoat and subcutaneous oedema create a mottled or streaky (hair) opacity superimposed on the thorax. Ultrasound coupling gel can also give rise to confusing patterns and should be thoroughly wiped off before radiography.</p>

<fig14.8/>
<fig14.9/>

<p>Lipomas, nipples and other soft tissue masses should be recognized radiographically. If palpable, it can be useful to mark masses with barium or a radiopaque marker, to account for their contributing radiopacity to the radiographic image.</p>
</sec3>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Spine</title>
<p>For proper radiographic assessment of the thoracic spine it is important to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Position the animal in an extended position, preferably under general anaesthesia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensure straight positioning by use of positioning devices (foam wedges, trough):

</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Obtain a VD view rather than a DV radiograph (to avoid magnification).</p></list-item>

</sec3>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Sternum</title>
<p>The sternum is best evaluated on the lateral view (see Figure 1.23, p. 15) because of superimposition over the spine on straight VD/DV views. Oblique views can be helpful if sternal abnormalities are suspected. Normal degenerative ageing features include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Formation of ventral or dorsal bony spurs, bridging between sternebrae</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mineralization of sternal cartilages and sternal&#x2013;costal junctions.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
</sec3>
</sec2>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diaphragmatic silhouette</title>
<p>Several parameters should be taken into consideration when assessing the diaphragm radiographically:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Position</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Shape and symmetry</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Integrity and contour.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Numerous technical and patient-related factors have a great influence on the appearance of the diaphragmatic silhouette. These should be ruled out before diaphragmatic disease is diagnosed, and include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Location of the central ray and beam direction. The diaphragm appears different on radiographs centred over the abdomen</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Visceral distension, obesity, state and depth of respiration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recumbency of animal</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Breed-specific chest conformation.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diaphragmatic displacement</title>
<p>Diaphragmatic displacement is usually caused by thoracic or abdominal volume increase or reduction. Intrinsic diaphragmatic diseases, causing phrenic laxity, are rare. The position of the diaphragm can be subjectively assessed evaluating:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The distance between the diaphragmatic dome and the cardiac silhouette</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The orientation of the CdVC and cardiodiaphragmatic angle</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The caudal extent and angle of the costodiaphragmatic and lumbodiaphragmatic recesses.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>

<tab14.10/>
<fig14.11/>

<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Unilateral displacement:</title>
<p>DV or VD radiographs are best to assess alterations from the physiological asymmetry of the diaphragm (Figures 14.10, 14.11 and 14.12):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A raised right hemidiaphragm or a depressed left hemidiaphragm will accentuate the asymmetry</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A depressed right hemidiaphragm or a raised left hemidiaphragm will decrease the degree of asymmetry</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The costodiaphragmatic recesses will move cranially or caudally with the raised or depressed hemidiaphragm accordingly, both sides being then at a different level of rib number</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A marked asymmetry of the diaphragm without asymmetry of the costodiaphragmatic angles is usually of no clinical significance.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>

<fig14.12/>

<p>If a change in asymmetry of the diaphragm is suspected on the DV view, it should be confirmed by obtaining a VD view and <italic>vice versa</italic>. An increased asymmetry on the VD/DV views often corresponds to a marked disparity in the level of the two crura on the lateral view. Inspiratory as well as expiratory radiographs may help in confirming the asymmetry/disparity of level between the two crura.</p>
<p>Associated radiographic signs, such as thoracic wall integrity, pleural effusion or thickening, mediastinal shift and alterations in lung lobe volumes, should be assessed to identify a potential underlying thoracic aetiology.</p>
</sec4>

<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bilateral displacement:</title>
<p>Bilateral displacement of the diaphragm is more difficult to diagnose as the normal shape of the diaphragm is maintained (Figures 14.13, 14.14 and 14.15):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Repeated exposures at various stages of the respiratory cycle or continuous fluoroscopy may be necessary to assess the dynamics of the diaphragm in relation to respiration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In animals with radiographic signs of increased inspiratory effort yet an incompletely contracted diaphragm, an upper airway obstruction impeding respiratory flow and full lung inflation should be considered.</p></list-item>

</sec3>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interrupted outline and changes in diaphragmatic contour</title>
<p>The diaphragmatic silhouette should be assessed on at least two orthogonal views. Radiographic change or interruption of the diaphragmatic contour (see Figures 14.4 and 14.16) can be due to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The presence of soft tissue opacity cranial to the diaphragm (border obliteration)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interruption of the diaphragm with herniation of abdominal organs into the thorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Diaphragmatic masses.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Tenting of the diaphragm refers to small triangular protrusions with their base at the diaphragm and their peaks toward the lungs. This is frequently seen in cats, due to visualization of the diaphragmatic attachments to the costal arch ribs during deep inspiration. It can be a manifestation of pleural adhesion (inspiration and expiration).</p>
<p>If gas opacities outline both sides of the diaphragm, free peritoneal and/or retroperitoneal gas must be present (see Figure 14.49). The following should be considered:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pneumoretroperitoneum as an extension of pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recent laparotomy or other gas-introducing procedure</p></list-item>

<title>Diseases of the thoracic skeleton</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Congenital and developmental abnormalities</title>
<p>Congenital abnormalities of the thoracic skeleton are a relatively common phenomenon, particularly in dogs, and are often incidental. Rib, spinal and sternal abnormalities are often combined and should be assessed together. It is important to recognize these changes so as not to mistakenly diagnose pulmonary pathology due to superimposition.</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Abnormal number of ribs</title>
<p>This is usually an incidental finding, which is only relevant if the ribs are used as a surgical landmark. Supernumerous or subnumerous ribs are usually associated with transitional vertebrae at the cervicothoracic or thoracolumbar junction. Fusion of the first and second ribs is occasionally seen in chondrodystrophic dog breeds. Rib duplication is rare.</p>

<p>Metaphyseal osteopathy (hypertrophic osteodystrophy) is an osteomalacic disease in young growing dogs of unknown aetiology. It primarily affects metaphyses of the long bones but can also affect the ribs, which may be swollen and painful. The condition is usually self-limiting. Radiographic findings include abnormal radiolucent lines in all rib metaphyses. These are seen better on long bone metaphyses.</p>

<title>Sternal abnormalities</title>
<p>Variation in the size and number of sternebrae, and in the shape of the manubrium and xiphoid process, is common and is usually incidental. Cats commonly have a ventrally deviated xiphoid process, which can be painful.</p>
<p><italic>Sternal dysraphism</italic> is the failure of the left and right cartilaginous sternal precursors to fuse. It leads to a ventral defect that is only closed by thoracic fascia and pleura. In the absence of diaphragmatic defects, sternal dysraphism has no adverse respiratory or circulatory consequences.</p>
<p>The absence, splitting or malformation of the xiphoid cartilage has been associated with peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia, which can be a useful radiographic feature in distinguishing this condition from other pericardial diseases.</p>

<title>Other spinal disorders:</title>
<p>Transitional vertebrae (super- or subnumerous thoracic vertebrae) are only clinically relevant if used as surgical landmarks. Spondylosis deformans is very commonly seen in the ventral aspect of the thoracic spine of dogs and cats, and is of no clinical significance. If bone formation over at least four contiguous vertebrae is present, the condition is called disseminated skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), but does not cause thoracic disease. This term is derived from human medicine and its use in animals is controversial.</p>

<p>There is a widespread misconception that intervertebral disc degeneration and prolapse does not occur in the mid-thoracic spine. However, in cats and some dog breeds, such as the German Shepherd Dog, mid-thoracic degenerative disc disease with spinal cord compression is not uncommon.</p>

<title>Pectus excavatum:</title>
<p>Pectus excavatum (funnel chest) is a congenital or developmental abnormality, with a variable decrease in the thoracic dorsoventral diameter due to inward deviation of the sternum, especially in its middle portion. It can affect normal respiratory physiology in severe cases. Canine brachycephalic breeds are more commonly affected and concurrent congenital malformations have been reported (hypoplastic trachea, ventricular septal defect, peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia and mucopolysaccharidosis).</p>
<p>Pectus excavatum should be differentiated from physiological respiratory excursion of the sternum, which is relatively high in cats (3&#x2013;5 degrees). With severe inspiratory dyspnoea due to upper airway obstruction, the sternum rotates inward to its maximal range and can mimic mild pectus excavatum. It should also be differentiated from flail sternum (bilateral rib cartilage fractures, see below) by taking radiographs at peak inspiration and expiration.</p>

<title>Pectus carinatum:</title>
<p>Pectus carinatum (pigeon or keeled chest) is a rare congenital or developmental abnormality, with an increase in the dorsoventral diameter of the thoracic cavity due to the outward deviation of the cranial sternebrae, together with an inward deviation of the most caudal sternebrae.

<title>Fractures of the thoracic skeleton</title>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Rib fractures</title>
<p>Most rib fractures are of <italic>traumatic</italic> origin. However, particularly in outdoor cats or stray animals, a traumatic history is not always known. Traumatic fractures are usually transverse, oblique or segmental, and are often multiple and sequential. Displaced fragments can cause penetrating injuries, and open or closed pneumothorax. With a known history of trauma, rib fractures should be taken as an indicator of potential adjacent lung trauma. Radiographic signs of lung contusion may only become visible 6 hours after the injury; serial radiographs are useful to monitor pulmonary disease in such cases.</p>
<p>Rib fractures and thoracic wall bruising can be very painful and impair proper ventilation, leading to hypoxaemia. Non-displaced rib fractures are most commonly treated conservatively (analgesia and rest), whereas internally displaced rib fractures need surgical reduction and stabilization.</p>
<p>Flail chest is associated with the presence of three or more sequential segmental rib fractures or five or more single rib fractures.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Causes paradoxical movement of the affected portion of the thoracic wall (inward on inspiration, outward on expiration).</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Requires surgical stabilization.</p></list-item>
</list>

<p>Flail sternum is a specific form of flail chest, which can occur with multiple bilateral rib cartilage fractures and paradoxical respiratory movement of the sternum.</p>
<p><italic>Pathological</italic> or <italic>stress</italic> rib fractures are not uncommon and can be associated with conditions that weaken the bone structure, or as a result of chronic hyperinflation and cough. Features of pathological fractures include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Usually chronic malunion or non-union fracture</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>More common in females and cats</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Often multiple</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Occasionally occur as a greenstick fracture</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Usually not painful.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Without traumatic history, rib fractures should be considered as an indicator for underlying osteopenic, osteolytic or respiratory conditions. Possible underlying diseases of pathological or stress fractures are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Chronic feline renal disease or other causes of hyperparathyroidism</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rib neoplasia (fracture consistent with lesion location)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Feline asthma, chronic canine bronchial disease</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lobar emphysema.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Because of the constant movement of the thoracic bellows, ribs have a poor healing tendency and non-union or malunion fractures are commonly seen. The age of a fracture should be considered when relating it to the history and current complaint of the patient.</p>

<title>Rib and chest wall tumours</title>
<p>Primary rib tumours are relatively rare in dogs and very rare in cats; there is no known sex or breed predisposition, and they are also seen in young animals. Osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma are the most common; fibrosarcoma, haemangiosarcoma and benign neoplasms (osteoma, chondroma) are seen less frequently. Primary tumours are often located in the distal third of the rib (costochondral junction). They tend to metastasize to the lungs and other organs. Primary rib tumours are rare compared with appendicular primary bone tumours. Clinical signs are associated with the enlargement of the mass:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fixed firm chest wall mass in some cases</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can expand predominantly intrathoracically without a visible external mass</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dyspnoea, cough due to lung compression and/or haemothorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Front limb lameness if impeding on shoulder joint or brachial plexus.</p></list-item>
<p>Metastatic, bone marrow and invading soft tissue neoplasia in ribs have certain features:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Metastatic rib tumours are usually small and located in the proximal or middle portion of the rib</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Multiple myeloma frequently affect the ribs along with the vertebrae and other bones, where changes are more easily recognizable</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Primary bone lymphoma or bone involvement in multicentric lymphoma is rare in dogs and cats. Young animals can be affected. Primary bone lymphoma can preferentially affect the metaphyses in growing bones</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The most common soft tissue mass of the chest wall is fibrosarcoma, which is particularly common in cats. Fibrosarcomas can usually be distinguished from diffuse processes, such as cellulitis or haemorrhage, by their focal distribution and their propensity to grow toward the thoracic cavity. They can be difficult to differentiate from primary rib tumours. There is often polyostotic involment in soft tissue tumours</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pleural neoplasia (mesothelioma) can affect multiple ribs and be difficult to differentiate from other types of neoplasia.</p></list-item>
<p>Lipoma and liposarcoma may arise from the thoracic wall. Benign lipomas are extremely common in the subcutaneous layers of the thoracic wall, and are characterized as soft, moveable slow-growing masses. Occasionally, a benign mass arises from the internal thoracic wall and causes a mass effect on internal thoracic organs. Infiltrative lipomas and liposarcomas can also infiltrate the inter- and intramuscular layers of the thoracic wall.</p>

<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Tangential and opposite lateral radiographs are often helpful. Osteolysis is seen (Figure 14.35) but can be subtle to detect. There may be an irregular to sunburst periosteal reaction and amorphous new bone. Fractures may be present, with unsharp margins (pathological fracture).

<title>Other imaging techniques:</title>
<p>Ultrasonography is helpful to differentiate a mass lesion from pleural effusion, lung and other internal thoracic structures, and to characterize the nature and extent of the lesion. Assessment can be made of the mass movement in relation to respiration:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Chest wall mass moves with the rib cage</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung mass moves with pulmonary excursion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Smooth convex mass displaces the normal pleura&#x2013;lung interface inwards.</p></list-item>
<p>Most neoplasms have a mixed echogenic appearance (Figure 14.37a), often with central hypoechoic (necrosis, haemorrhage) regions. Hyperechoic foci with shadowing (soft tissue mineralization) may be identified. The margins may or may not be discernible. The echogenicity of the mass should always be compared with the adjacent normal tissue. This can be useful in identifying a lipoma, which is uniformly hyperechoic compared with the surrounding tissue (Figure 14.37b). A liposarcoma is more echogenic and less organized than a lipoma.</p>
<p>Ultrasonography is rarely tissue- or cell-specific but is very useful in guiding a needle into a mass for aspiration or biopsy. CT and MRI can be very helpful to assess:

<title>Osteomyelitis and abscessation:</title>
<p>Infections of the thoracic wall result from foreign bodies, lacerations, bite wounds or surgical wound contamination. Migrating foreign bodies, such as grass awns, penetrating via the skin, or a wooden skewer, penetrating via the gastrointestinal tract, can cause inflammatory disease, an abscess/granuloma, a fistulous tract in the thoracic wall region or even lead to pleural effusion. Inhaled grass awns often migrate towards the epaxial musculature of the cranial lumbar spine, causing local abscessation and spondylitis. Fungal or parasitic (hepatozoonosis) osteomyelitis and cellulitis occur in endemic areas. These lesions are often very painful, more so than neoplasia.</p>

<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Metabolic diseases:</title>
<p>Nutritional or renal hyperparathyroidism causes marked demineralization and deformities of the entire skeleton, and pathological fractures.

<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Hypertrophic osteopathy:</title>
<p>In the presence of large chronic masses in the lungs or other thoracic organs, a systemic response can be evoked in the appendicular and, to a lesser extent, in the axial skeleton. It can also be induced by a non-thoracic mass. The distal legs are most commonly affected; the ribs are less commonly affected. Aetiological theories include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Circulating toxins from the mass lesion, promoting periosteal response</p></list-item>

<title>Diseases of the diaphragm</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diaphragmatic rupture</title>
<p>Diaphragmatic ruptures are usually traumatic in origin. They are frequently misnamed as <italic>acquired diaphragmatic hernias.</italic> This is an incorrect term, since the prolapsed organs are not contained within a hernial sac.</p>
<p>The diaphragm normally ruptures at its weakest point, following a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure while the glottis is open. The site and size of the rupture are variable. Right-sided tears are reported to be more frequent than left-sided. Tears can extend from one side to the other and be radial or circumferential.</p>
<p>The liver is the most frequently prolapsed organ with right-sided ruptures; the stomach is the most frequently prolapsed organ with left-sided ruptures. Prolapse of the small intestines and omentum can be present with any tear. Less commonly prolapsed organs include the spleen, large intestine, omentum, uterus and kidney.</p>
<p>The most frequent clinical sign is dyspnoea; ranging from mild to severe, depending on the volume of the prolapsed organs and fluid accumulation. Other clinical signs can be present, such as regurgitation or vomiting, and are related to the organ prolapsed in the thoracic cavity. Gastric prolapse is a surgical emergency as sudden strangulation and bloating may quickly become life-threatening.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>A DV view should be taken to avoid further respiratory compromise. Positional radiographs, such as a lateral view using a horizontal beam, should be considered if the respiratory distress worsens in lateral recumbency. It is useful to obtain abdominal radiographs to be able to check for the presence of abdominal organs. One or more of the following radiographic signs can be detected (Figure 14.47):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Loss or change of contour of the diaphragmatic outline</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obliteration and/or dorsal displacement of the cardiac shadow</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased opacity of the ventral thoracic cavity, with or without elevation of the trachea and/or cardiac silhouette</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mediastinal shift</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Presence of gas-filled tubular structures and/or speckled mineral opacities, suggestive of the ingesta-filled gastrointestinal tract being located within the thoracic cavity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pleural effusion may be present and mask herniated parenchymal organs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung lobe collapse</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Absence of abdominal organs from the abdominal cavity is often associated with cranioventral displacement of the stomach axis. Some organs may be clearly identified within the thoracic cavity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In cats, falciform fat may be the only abdominal organ herniated, in which case the fat pad ventral to the liver will appear very small, the liver will be closer to the abdominal wall and the ventral outline of the diaphragm will be lost</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Other radiographic signs of trauma (e.g. rib fractures, lung contusions and appendicular skeleton fractures).</p></list-item>
<p>A diaphragmatic tear without organ prolapse cannot be ruled out based on the absence of radiographic signs.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</bold></italic> Contrast studies which may aid diagnosis include:</p>
<list-item><p><italic>Barium transit studies</italic> (Figure 14.48) are useful if survey radiography is equivocal. Radiographs should be repeated over a time period long enough to demonstrate the presence of the stomach, small and/or large intestines within the thoracic cavity, or cranioventral displacement of the gastric axis if only liver has herniated. Barium studies are contraindicated when perforation of the gastrointestinal tract is suspected in addition to the diaphragmatic rupture. Water-soluble iodinated agents can be used instead</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Positive-contrast peritoneography</italic>. A positive non-ionic iodine-based contrast medium is injected into, and should remain in, the peritoneal cavity. If positive contrast medium is found in the pleural space, diaphragmatic rupture is confirmed. A negative study does not rule out a diaphragmatic rupture since, in chronic cases, adhesions may obstruct the tear</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Pneumo</italic>- or <italic>capnoperitoneography</italic> (Figure 14.49). Positive-contrast studies are preferred and easier to interpret. A small quantity of gas is injected into the peritoneal cavity. If a pneumothorax is then radiographically visible, diaphragmatic rupture is confirmed. Carbon dioxide is preferred due to the reduced risk of vascular air emboli (capnoperitoneography). A negative study does not rule out a diaphragmatic rupture.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>This is a useful non-invasive method to identify an unclear case of diaphragmatic rupture and organ prolapse. It can be difficult to determine this as the normal diaphragmatic outline is hard to visualize and mirror image artefacts can be confusing. The following should be looked for:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Visualization of abdominal organs in the pleural cavity. Differentiation between normal liver and consolidated/collapsed lung may be difficult</p></list-item>

<title>Diaphragmatic hernias</title>
<p>Diaphragmatic hernias are common congenital anomalies in dogs and cats, due to agenesis of a portion of the diaphragm or lack of fusion between the parts of the primitive diaphragm. They include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Ventral diaphragmatic hernias</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hiatal hernias</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Paraoesophageal intramediastinal hernias</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Peritoneopericardial hernias</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Aortic hiatal diaphragmatic hernias.</p></list-item>
<p>In contrast to diaphragmatic ruptures, the prolapsed abdominal organs are contained within a peritoneal or pericardial hernial sac, i.e. are <italic>herniated.</italic> Diaphragmatic hernias are usually found in young animals with no history of trauma. They appear in predetermined areas of the diaphragm and may be associated with other congenital defects. No granulation or scar tissue will be found during surgery. Hiatal hernias may be acquired. Hernia of the cranial abdominal wall can lead to a <italic>paracostal hernia,</italic> where the hernial sac is contained between the ribs and soft tissue layers of the thorax.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Paracostal abdominal wall hernia</title>
<p>Herniation of viscera occurs via a body wall defect at the costal arch. Abdominal viscera are contained in the subcutaneous layers of the thoracic wall.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>There is a soft tissue swelling along the body wall, which may contain gas-filled viscera (Figure 14.50).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ventral diaphragmatic hernia</title>
<p>Ventral (true) diaphragmatic hernias are typically due to a congenital lack of fusion between parts of the primitive diaphragm, which leads to the persistence of an aperture through which abdominal organs herniate into the thoracic cavity. Abdominal organs are contained within a hernial sac, usually the parietal pleura of the diaphragm, which prevents direct communication between the peritoneal and pleural cavities. True ventral diaphragmatic hernias are rare in animals. They are usually small and not associated with clinical signs.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>There is a cranial bulge in the ventral diaphragmatic silhouette with a possible cardiac shift away from the bulge on a lateral radiograph.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Hiatal hernia</title>
<p>A hiatal hernia corresponds to a herniation of any abdominal organ through the oesophageal hiatus. It is most often congenital in origin but can be acquired, following the repair of a chronic diaphragmatic rupture or secondary to a traumatic event, oesophageal/upper respiratory tract pathologies or neuromuscular disorders. Three main types of hiatal hernia are recognized in animals (Figure 14.51):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Short oesophagus hiatal hernia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sliding hiatal hernia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Paraoesophageal hiatal hernia.</p></list-item>
<p>Sliding and paraoesophageal hiatal hernias can coexist. Chinese Shar Pei dogs are predisposed for hiatal hernias.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Short oesophagus hiatal hernia:</title>
<p>The lower oesophageal sphincter lies in the caudal mediastinum due to a short oesophagus. The cardia is pulled through the oesophageal hiatus. This type of hernia is very rare and has only been described in the dog.</p>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Ovoid soft tissue opacity in the mid-caudal thorax with a locally obliterated diaphragmatic silhouette on a lateral radiograph.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Permanent appearance.</p></list-item>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Sliding intramediastinal hiatal hernia:</title>
<p>The lower oesophageal sphincter moves freely back and forth into the caudal mediastinum, followed by parts of the stomach, through a loose oesophageal hiatus (see Figure 14.51a). Clinical signs include variable degrees of vomiting or regurgitation, hypersalivation and chronic weight loss. If the stomach is incarcerated, severe respiratory distress can be present. Aspiration pneumonia is frequently associated with this condition.</p>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Radiographic findings (Figure 14.52) include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Semicircular soft tissue mass, merging with the liver shadow localized between the CdVC and the aorta on the lateral view and in the caudal mediastinum on the DV view, superimposed over the hepatic shadow</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gas present in the herniated stomach may allow recognition of rugal folds. If a large portion of the stomach is herniated and incarcerated, a large hyperlucent cyst-like structure surrounded by a thin soft tissue rim may be seen. In this case, lung collapse and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side is also visible</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Radiographic signs of aspiration pneumonia may be an associated finding.</p></list-item>
<p>Radiographic signs might be absent, particularly during expiration, due to the sliding nature of the hernia. Positional radiography is usually unsuccessful in demonstrating a sliding hiatal hernia.</p>
<p>Contrast studies (Figure 14.53) may aid diagnosis:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A barium oesophagram may confirm suspicion of a sliding hiatal hernia. As the lower oesophageal sphincter moves back and forth, it can be in a normal position at the time of the examination</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gastric rugae may be visible both in the caudal mediastinum and in the cranial abdomen, separated by a marked narrowing at the level of the oesophageal hiatus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The lower oesophageal hiatus can be seen cranial to the cardia as a shallow indentation. It also allows assessment of concurrent oesophageal disorders, such as strictures or masses.</p></list-item>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Fluoroscopy:</title>
<p>This, together with an oesophagram, allows dynamic assessment of the position of the lower oesophageal sphincter and of the stomach. As the lower oesophageal sphincter function is altered due to its abnormal position, gastro-oesophageal reflux of contrast medium may be seen associated with swallowing.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Paraoesophageal hiatal hernia:</title>
<p>The lower oesophageal sphincter remains in place and is competent, but part of the stomach surrounded by a peritoneal sac herniates through the oesophageal hiatus parallel to an immobile oesophagus. Two subtypes exist:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Abdominal organs may herniate to the left of the oesophagus in which case they come to lie in the pleural cavity (see Figure 14.51b)</p></list-item>

This space is normally closed by a thin membrane, which may be congenitally weak or ruptured following trauma. The prolapsed organs, usually part of the stomach, liver or small intestines, can move in and out as the space widens during inspiration and shrinks during expiration.</p></list-item>
<p>Clinical signs may range from none to recurrent gastrointestinal signs, including anorexia, retching, vomiting or bloating of the stomach without gastric torsion.</p>

<title>Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia</title>
<p>Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH) is the most common diaphragmatic hernia in dogs and cats. It is due to an embryological fusion defect in the ventral diaphragm, leading to a communication between the pericardial and the peritoneal cavities. PPDHs are often associated with sternal or cardiac defects. The liver is the most frequently herniated organ, and may be associated with gallbladder, stomach, small intestine or omental herniation.</p>
<p>Clinical signs depend on the organs herniated and the size of the defect, and include respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disorders. Auscultation may reveal muffled heart sounds or borborygmy over the cardiac area. Sudden onset of clinical signs may arise secondary to strangulation of a herniated organ. Most frequently no clinical signs are present and a PPDH is found incidentally.</p>

<title>Fluoroscopy</title>
<p>This is the imaging modality of choice to observe respiratory excursion of the diaphragm. There is a reduced range of motion of one crus, or paradoxical movement of both crura, during the respiratory cycle.</p>

<title>Diaphragmatic flutter</title>
<p>Flutter of the diaphragm consists of synchronous spastic contractions of one or both hemidiaphragms. It occurs synchronous with the first heart sound. It is thought to be due to a lower threshold of excitability of the phrenic nerves at the level of the pericardium, which allows their stimulation by action currents of the myocardium. It is commonly a self-limiting condition that disappears if the underlying cause is treated, usually an electrolyte imbalance of variable origin. Marked rhythmic movements of the costal arch and the abdominal wall are the only clinical signs of a diaphragmatic flutter. These can last from only a few days to several months.</p>

<title>Fluoroscopy</title>
<p>This allows dynamic visualization of the spastic contractions of one or both hemidiaphragms, synchronous with the heartbeat. This is not detectable radiographically.</p>
