<title>The living chronicles of a People&#x2019;s War</title>
<p>Rainy season 2009.</p>
<p>I sheltered from the sun next to an old man dressed in an austere outfit.In fact, I had already finished a master&#x2019;s paper on the US military doctrine in the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>The old man turned to regard me with a cold smile and seemed impressed. &#x201C;The Vietnamese military operations in Cambodia were a more interesting story,&#x201D; he rebutted. I was dazed. I immediately asked myself why I didn&#x2019;t study the &#x201C;classic war&#x201D; in Cambodia from 1979 to 1991. I then gave myself a reassuring answer &#x201C;It&#x2019;s impossible. No one could do it, there is no source.&#x201D; Immediately giving up on this momentary spark of interest, I continued the conversation. &#x201C;Have you served in the military, uncle?&#x201D; I asked. To which he answered &#x201C;Yes, but I served in the Vietnamese unit, the 330th Division.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I had no clue as to what he was talking about. What? A Cambodian serving in a Vietnamese military unit? The old man must have been confused, I thought. But I was wrong again. I would later learn that during the Vietnamese drive inside Cambodia in 1979, they recruited many refugees into their ranks and many would return to work in the Cambodian units
<target target-type="page" id="page_2"/>with actual combat experience. It&#x2019;s certainly possible that a few could have chosen to stay in the division. But in 2009, I had no clue. &#x201C;Was it good?&#x201D; I asked. To my surprise, he did not answer in the affirmative.</p>
<p>The old man claimed that his unit operated in Battambang province and in one major operation, he witnessed the failed Vietnamese frontal assaults on fortified positions on high ground. The assault was repeated several times to no avail. &#x201C;The division lost a lot of men,&#x201D; the old man said. I could see that the weight of memory gave him quite an uneasy feeling.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So you&#x2019;ve now quit the martial arts world, right?&#x201D; I asked by making reference to a popular Chinese martial arts movie series at the time, in order to help relieve some tensions in his mind.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes. I&#x2019;m retired, but I still receive pensions from the division,&#x201D; the old man answered. Our conversation concluded when the embassy guard called us in to collect the approved visa.</p>
<p>The conversation lingered in my mind even after I bid farewell to that veteran of the People&#x2019;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 330th Division. But there was nothing I could do. It was not like I could just call the 330th Division, asking about some undated and unnamed operation to try to test the old man&#x2019;s claims.</p>
<p>Five years later, I was sitting with a former commander of a division belonging to the Phnom Penh government, the regime that was supported by Vietnam in the 1980s. The former commander was initially a regimental commander of the Cambodian 196th Division. His unit operated in support of the Vietnamese division, which he happened to identify as the 330th Division. The former commander claimed that the Vietnamese ran out of ideas, as their assaults on the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s fortified position on a large hill were repeatedly repelled. He then suggested an indirect attack involving an infiltration force behind the enemy lines. By avoiding frontal assault, the former commander was able to defeat the fortified position in the first assault and with a smaller force. The Vietnamese were impressed. The former commander was later rewarded with the command of a newly established 6th Division. I have always wondered if the former commander witnessed the very same Vietnamese assaults described by the old man I met outside the US embassy in 2009.</p>
<p>A new realization started to sink in. I was starting to think about the future of my writing project. As a political scientist by trade, my dissertation was quite theoretical, although I use historical accounts as evidence. After some interesting discussions with my PhD dissertation committee at the University of Delaware, as well as my master&#x2019;s committee at the US Army Command and General Staff College, I decided to do what I could do best: to do the things that have never been done before.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Vietnam War has been studied to death,&#x201D; one of my mentors had commented. The director of graduate studies at the US Army Command and General Staff College bluntly noted:
<disp-quote>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_3"/>Unless you have discovered previously unexamined archives from the Central Committee or the Imperial General Staff, it&#x2019;s unlikely that your work is going to be original. This is especially true if you study World War I, World War II, or the Vietnam War.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Any research in these topics now tends to be residual.</p>
<p>Consequently, I have decided to construct a historical narrative of the Cambodian civil war from 1979 to 1991. I was repeatedly advised and encouraged that being a Cambodian scholar, I have an undeniable advantage: I could understand the culture, speak the language, and would find it easy to find the primary sources. But there is indeed a very difficult challenge in trying to chronicle the war from 1979 to 1991. A combination of lack of care and political upheavals contributed to the destruction and deterioration of most of the written archives. A large part of any research would necessitate tracking down the &#x201C;living chronicles of war,&#x201D; i.e. the veterans of all four factions in the war. To say that this is difficult is a gross understatement.</p>
<p>Sometimes, what one needs is pure luck.</p>
<p>Luck for me materialized in the form of one of the major military figures in the war, the late General (retired) Dien Del, who was a high-ranking military commander of one of the four factions, the Khmer People&#x2019;s National Liberation Front (KPNLF). But he had already retired by the time I started my research and it was almost impossible to find him. Nevertheless, as fate would have it, in 2011, I was invited to my neighbor&#x2019;s wedding and I was randomly ushered onto a table, sitting opposite to an old man who I recognized as General Dien Del. We exchanged contacts and I was able to interview him twice before he regrettably passed away in 2013. This research was not a short or easy process, nor was it frustration free.</p>
<p>Over a period of seven years, the laborious process of research and trying to find witnesses continued. I was very privileged to eventually meet and converse with veterans from all four factions, sometimes privately, sometimes as part of my job as Deputy Director of the Institute of Military History. From former battalion commanders to former divisional commanders, from former deputy chief of staffs to the former militias and territorial forces, everyone was eager to share their life stories and perspectives on the war. All of these oral accounts were then checked against the scant written archives that could be found to produce the narrative in this book.</p>

<title>What makes this book unique</title>
<p>A necessary background is that Cambodia was plunged into full-scale war in 1970 when Prime Minister Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirimatak carried out a coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat that deposed Prince Sihanouk who was then head of state.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Even though one can also count 1968 as the start of the war because of the armed insurrection, albeit on a small scale, in Samlaut district, Battambang province, the year 1970 was a time when everywhere in Cambodia became
<target target-type="page" id="page_4"/>a battlefield. The war did not end until 1999, when the last remnants of the Khmer Rouge, ironically also from the district of Samlaut, integrated into the government under the framework of Prime Minister Hun Sen&#x2019;s &#x201C;Win-Win Policy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, the destruction of war that persisted over that period, occurrence of unusually extreme events (such as the city-wide forced evacuation under the Khmer Rouge in 1975) and more importantly, a lack of care, all had destructive effects on the archives. Most of the written archives were either destroyed or left to the elements. Those left to the elements deteriorated beyond any possibility of recovery.</p>
<p>The twenty-nine-year-old civil war could be divided into many periods. However, to simplify matters, we can divide the war into five major periods. The first period was from 1970 to 1975. The regime born out of the 1970 coup, the Khmer Republic fought against the Khmer Rouge and until 1973, the elements of the PAVN and the People&#x2019;s Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF) who sought sanctuaries in Cambodia during the Vietnam War.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_2"><sup>2</sup></xref> The second period was the Khmer Rouge period from 1975 to 1979, which was marked by genocide, mass killings, and a virtual destruction of the fabric of Cambodian society. Within this time frame, one could also count a third period between 1977 and 1979, which was marked by border war between Democratic Kampuchea (official name of the Khmer Rouge state) and Vietnam, which led to the Vietnamese intervention in 1979 and the collapse of the Khmer Rouge regime.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_3"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
<p>The fourth period was between 1979 and 1991 when four factions fought against each other. Vietnam and the Soviet Union supported the People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) against the Khmer Rouge, the KPNLF, and Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s movement, all of which were supported by the United States, China, and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p>All factions eventually agreed to a political settlement in 1991 and allowed the United Nations to organize elections to establish a government. But war continued as the Khmer Rouge boycotted the election and vowed to fight even without external support. Thus, the last period of the Cambodian civil war was from 1993 to 1999. This could be called the &#x201C;Win-Win Policy&#x201D; period, following the namesake of the policy of Prime Minister Hun Sen that integrated the last remnant of the Khmer Rouge into the government and ended the war.</p>
<p>All of these periods received careful and comprehensive examinations and studies by many scholars, most of whom are not Cambodian. This should come as no surprise, given the fact that the intellectuals in Cambodia barely survived the political and military upheavals in the twenty-nine-year-old war. The major exception was the fourth period between 1979 and 1991, which received very little attention. The main reasons why no book has ever studied this crucial period of Cambodian history have been the lack of sources and, to a certain extent, the false belief that the Vietnamese army, the PAVN,
<target target-type="page" id="page_5"/>did all the fighting for the PRK, thus rendering the study of the PRK&#x2019;s military exploits useless.</p>
<p>The current book aspires to bridge this gap in the literature by attempting to provide an authoritative narrative of the military and strategic history of the Cambodian civil war between 1979 and 1991.</p>
<p>To understand what this book brings to the table, one must first look at what had already existed in the literature. We could distinguish at least four themes of scholarly works that relate to the five periods of the Cambodian civil war. The works listed here are by no means exhaustive.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_4"><sup>4</sup></xref> They act only as reference points to the new researchers in the history of Cambodia.</p>
<p>The first theme was genocide study and the biography of Pol Pot. This theme occupies perhaps the largest space in the literature on the Cambodian civil war. The world was shocked by the scale of the disaster and the insanity that led to the Cambodian genocide. At least one million people perished under the Khmer Rouge regime (Democratic Kampuchea) between 1975 and 1979.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_5"><sup>5</sup></xref> A study of this sort inevitably leads scholars to ask why a country that was known to the French as <italic>pays du sourire</italic> (country of smiles) became hell on earth. Charles Meyer, for example, authored a book with a telling title, <italic>Derri&#x00E8;re le Sourire Khmer</italic> (Behind the Khmer Smile).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_6"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
<p>The major contributions in the search for the source of all the disasters were the books by Australian scholars Ben Kiernan and David Chandler. Both were fortunate enough to possess primary materials such as internal party documents (which probably surfaced after the Vietnamese intervention in 1979), which allowed them to trace the life story of Pol Pot, how he came to power, and the nature of his policy and ideology. Kiernan&#x2019;s <italic>How Pol Pot Came to Power</italic> and <italic>The Pol Pot Regime</italic> chronicled the rise of Pol Pot and his cliques as well as the history of the Khmer Rouge regime.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_7"><sup>7</sup></xref> What Kiernan missed, Chandler has filled the gap in his book, <italic>Pol Pot: Brother Number One</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_8"><sup>8</sup></xref> Chandler also extensively studied the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s notorious prison &#x201C;S-21&#x201D; in his book, <italic>Voices from S-21</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_9"><sup>9</sup></xref> In addition to these English books, French authors who had lived in Cambodia until 1975 also published books that shed light on the events from 1970 to 1975. Meyer&#x2019;s book above is one example. Another similar book was authored by Fran&#x00E7;ois Ponchaud, <italic>Cambodge: Ann&#x00E9;e Z&#x00E9;ro</italic> (Cambodia: Year Zero), which recounted life under the Khmer Rouge.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_10"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
<p>These are only some of the major books. Other books offering specialized or complementary studies of the Khmer Rouge regime include, but are not limited to: Henri Locard&#x2019;s <italic>Pol Pot&#x2019;s Little Red Book</italic>, Philip Short&#x2019;s <italic>Anatomy of a Nightmare</italic>, Alexander Hinton&#x2019;s <italic>Why Did They Kill</italic>, Elizabeth Becker&#x2019;s <italic>When the War was Over</italic>, and Timothy Carny&#x2019;s <italic>Communist Party Power in Kampuchea</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_11"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
<p>The second theme could be counted as part of the first theme, although this second one focused more on the war between the Khmer Rouge and Vietnam between 1977 and 1979. Two books are of importance here: Nayan Chanda&#x2019;s <italic>Brother Enemy</italic> and Stephen Morris&#x2019; <italic>Why Vietnam Invaded
<target target-type="page" id="page_6"/>Cambodia</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_12"><sup>12</sup></xref> In 2013, I published a book with Praeger, documenting the military history of the Khmer Rouge, a large part of which was dedicated to the war between 1977 and 1979.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_13"><sup>13</sup></xref> This is where the gap in the literature occurs. From 1979 to 1991, there were five books that could be said to have covered the period, none of which offered comprehensive accounts.</p>
<p>The first one was Marie Alexandrine Martin&#x2019;s <italic>Le Mal Cambodgien</italic> (the translated version by Mark McLeod is <italic>A Shattered Society</italic>), which documented some significant activities of the PRK and the Vietnamese troops in Cambodia but failed to offer a comprehensive account.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_14"><sup>14</sup></xref> After all, only half of the book covered the period in question while the other half covered the Khmer Rouge regime. A similar book was Nicolas R&#x00E9;gaud&#x2019;s <italic>Cambodge dans la Tourmente</italic>, which talked about major events such as the Vietnamese dry season offensive in 1985, but then again failed to elaborate.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_15"><sup>15</sup></xref> Both of these books mentioned major events but failed to analyze the causes and consequences as well as how the events unfolded.</p>
<p>The third book specifically studied the People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea, the government that was supported by Vietnam. Margaret Slocomb&#x2019;s <italic>The People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea 1979&#x2013;1989</italic> was perhaps the most sophisticated book to date that tried to study the regime.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_16"><sup>16</sup></xref> While the book was quite comprehensive and accurate, it was a book on political history and contained virtually no information about the role of the military in maintaining the survivability of this regime against a host of enemies at a time when the PRK&#x2019;s main sponsor, the Soviet Union, was about to collapse and the Vietnamese economy was faltering.</p>
<p>Two more recent books tried to bridge the gap but, in my judgement, still came out short. The first one was Kenneth Conboy&#x2019;s <italic>The Cambodian Wars: Clashing Armies and CIA Covert Operations</italic>, which documented the American involvement in Cambodia since 1970.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_17"><sup>17</sup></xref> The second one was a recent book by Daniel Bultmann, which employed a sociological perspective to study the military organization of the resistance movements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_18"><sup>18</sup></xref> While both attempted to study the military, they were still incomplete. Conboy studied only one movement, the KPNLF whose officers were former Khmer Republic soldiers, former American allies in the Cambodian civil war. The limitation can most easily be seen when it is only towards the second half of the book, that Conboy begins to talk about the KPNLF&#x2019;s military exploits. This comes as no surprise, since a narrow description of only one movement could hardly produce lengthy chapters. Nevertheless, the accounts of the KPNLF&#x2019;s operations were very accurate because Conboy himself was personally involved in many activities related to the movement.</p>
<p>In contrast, Bultmann studied all three resistance movements, but the tool he used (i.e. sociology) actually limited what can be studied. Bultmann&#x2019;s work was significant and accurate in its description of how military organization was maintained in a time of war, but it did not examine two other aspects of organization theory: organization learning and joint military command. The acid test of the effectiveness of any military organization is its performance
<target target-type="page" id="page_7"/>in combat, in the event of major campaigns (say, divisional level and above). A military may be organizationally strong and cohesive under normal circumstances, but in battle, things could go ugly really fast. This was especially true in the period between 1982 and 1985 when all three resistance movements attempted to adapt their organizations to the effects of major Vietnamese offensives. Bultmann&#x2019;s work is limited in its examination of this &#x201C;organizational learning&#x201D; during major campaigns: how the organizations adapted themselves to the weight of the enemy offensive to avoid annihilation.</p>
<p>In addition, a special form of military organization called &#x201C;joint command,&#x201D; which occurred when different militaries tried to pool their resources to fight a larger enemy, was also not examined. Joint command is usually what many commanders dread because it is an incredibly difficult thing to do. Nonetheless, in some circumstances, joint command is the only viable solution for winning the war or winning it at an affordable cost. Accordingly, this current book will argue that one shortcoming of the resistance movements in Cambodia is precisely the failure to organize an effective joint command.</p>
<p>Joint command is not a mere agreement at the top. After the KPNLF agreed to a formal joint command with the army of Prince Sihanouk, the effects of the agreement did not actually trickle down to the soldiers who struggled to cope with the new organization during the time of intense operations between 1989 and 1991. In summary, while Bultmann did study the military organization of the three resistance movements, he did not examine the evolution of those organizations or how they adapted to the harsh realities of joint command.</p>
<p>Above all, the literature on the war in Cambodia from 1979 to 1991 lacked a study of the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s military exploits, the clever political-military manoeuvre of Prince Sihanouk, and the relentless defense of the Phnom Penh government against the onslaught of the resistance movements. These are parts of the stories that this current book will tell.</p>
<p>The fourth theme of research related to the war in Cambodia covered the negotiation process between 1987 and 1991, the United Nations mission, and the humanitarian aspects of the war. Most of these books are in French. After all, Prince Sihanouk was a fluent French speaker and often issued statements or gave interviews in French, thus giving the French scholars a clear advantage. Some useful books in this theme include: Nicolas R&#x00E9;gaud&#x2019;s <italic>Cambodge dans la Tourmente</italic>, Richard Sola&#x2019;s <italic>Le Cambodge de Sihanouk</italic>, David Roberts&#x2019; <italic>Political Transition in Cambodia 1991&#x2013;1999</italic>, Raoul M. Jennar&#x2019;s <italic>Cambodian Chronicles, 1989&#x2013;1996</italic>, and Evan Gottesman&#x2019;s <italic>Cambodia After the Khmer Rouge</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_19"><sup>19</sup></xref> While most of these books documented almost in minute detail the chain of political negotiations between 1987 and 1991 leading to the Paris Peace Agreements on 23 October 1991, there was virtually no mention of how realities on the battlefield affected the negotiations. As a result, our understanding of the period can not be provided by the current literature.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_8"/>In one illuminating example, as the resistance movements became increasingly accommodating in the negotiations in late 1990, the authors were puzzled, and rushed to find answers. After all, the Phnom Penh government was isolated and not many analysts would give it a fighting chance (resulting from the assumption that this regime was merely Vietnam&#x2019;s &#x201C;puppet regime&#x201D;) while the resistance movements were running rampant on the battlefield. So there was no reason why the latter should be so accommodating to the demands of the Phnom Penh government. Richard Sola seemed to have found the answer. He related an anecdote that while in Beijing, Prince Sihanouk had consulted a famous Indian fortune teller who was visiting China at the time.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_20"><sup>20</sup></xref> The fortune teller gave an ominous prediction: Prince Sihanouk would not live past the next five years. To Sola, this was perhaps the reason why Prince Sihanouk was willing to do anything and to accept anything, as long as he could return to his homeland in the little time that remained.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_21"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
<p>This was an interesting story. As a young student, I was so amazed with this account and could recount all the details of that story. Other authors also offered similar stories and anecdotes that tried to explain the accommodating behavior of the leaders of the resistance movements.</p>
<p>In this current book, however, I offer instead a military explanation of such behavior. By the late 1990s, the resistance movements lost most of their conquered territories, most of their forces were heavily depleted, and in January 1991, the People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea (the Phnom Penh government) was able to launch a major offensive that rivaled that of the Vietnamese offensive in the 1980s. These battlefield realities, in the opinion of this researcher, were the real causes of accommodating behavior by the resistance movements.</p>
<p>This book therefore offers a military and strategic history of the Cambodian civil war from 1979 to 1991, documenting the ideology, organization, order of battle, tactical doctrine, operational history, and strategy of the four factions in the war, as well as analyzing major campaigns and battles that underpinned the political negotiations from 1987 to 1991. This endeavor is supported by a combination of primary sources gathered over the past seven years as well as numerous visits to the former battlefields. The next section explains in detail the nature of these sources.</p>

<title>Notes on sources</title>
<p>The full history of the Cambodian civil war from 1979 to 1991 has always been hindered by a lack of sources. This book will rely heavily on data obtained from interviews or published materials that were constructed from interviews. This is not an easy task. The first problem with such accounts is imprecision. Memory loss is also an omnipresent issue. Assuming the interviewees are willing to talk and the interviewers have a well-constructed interview questionnaire or framework, memory loss still threatens to render
<target target-type="page" id="page_9"/>everything useless. Any attempt to interview someone suffering from memory loss will yield imprecise data. The respondents tend to tell generic stories without distinctive references such as date, locations, people, or events. I have encountered many of these cases, the case of the old man I met in front of the US embassy being one example. I will therefore treat those cases not as data points, but as anecdotes only.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, even those interviews that could yield precise data still have three potential pitfalls: bias, confusion, and faulty assumptions. First of all, bias is inherent in human nature. Not a lot of people are as enthusiastic to talk about failures as about success. Memory suppression, story omission, and plainly fabricated stories are usually present in a biased narrative. Any interview that has some elements of bias would not be able to stand up to rigorous academic scrutiny.</p>
<p>The second problem is confusion, or what we may call, honest mistakes. In the Cambodian civil war, just like many other wars, many battles were fought again and again on the same battlefield. With limited written accounts, even the most honest interviewees could easily mistake one event for another. In Cambodia, for example, an area rich in gemstone minerals known as Pailin (in Battambang province) had experienced major battles of similar magnitude in 1983, 1984, 1989, 1991, and 1994. In some other places such as the Staung district in Kampong Thom province, the place changed ownership so frequently, that high school examinations actually had to take place during the military offensive because war had already become a part of the local people&#x2019;s lives. In these instances, people could easily remember one event as occurring at completely the wrong date.</p>
<p>Finally, the third pitfall of interviews is faulty assumptions by the interviewees. Imperfection is inherent in all human begins. Ten people who have experienced the same event could easily remember it in ten different ways. If somehow we could organize them into a focus group and try to recount the story, they might even come up with a compromised, but inaccurate, grand narrative. Neither case is desirable.</p>
<p>To deal with these three pitfalls of interviews, this book employs two methodological countermeasures. The first one is quite simple, but needs to be applied at the time of interviews: be active during the interview, try to detect inconsistencies in the story, and ask challenging questions for clarifications. But this countermeasure can only go so far. No one can detect all inconsistencies, especially if the story is completely new to the interviewer. As a result, this book employs another simple, but laborious, methodological countermeasure: information cross-checking.</p>
<p>Writing about the history of a civil war is always difficult because all sources are prone to manipulation and bias, mostly because all sides feel the need to put a positive &#x2018;spin&#x2019; on perceptions in the interest of propaganda. In fact, one could argue that a successful faction is usually the one with the best propaganda. All oral accounts, and all other sources for that matter in the following analysis, are considered to be unsubstantiated claims until they
<target target-type="page" id="page_10"/>have been corroborated by other independent sources. If an account cannot be backed up by independent sources, or if the sources give conflicting data, the following analysis will clearly provide appropriate qualifications.</p>
<p>This book therefore employs a number of alternative sources to crosscheck with the oral accounts. The book will strive for objectivity by crosschecking a claim in the materials of one faction with the materials from other sources. To try to achieve this objective, this book will make use of primary sources of all types, and from all factions, and will cross-check them with each other to try to reduce the effect of propaganda on the narrative of actual events.</p>
<p>Quantitatively, the sources are not evenly distributed across factions and types. Some factions have more primary material than others (such as communist versus non-communist factions). At the same time, some types of materials are more widely available than other types (such as interviews versus written sources). Of the four factions, the KPNLF received perhaps the most extensive coverage. As a pro-Western, non-communist faction, the KPNLF had many Anglophone friends who could recount, narrate, and publish its exploits. As is often the case, the history of the KPNLF paints a heroic story of a liberation movement that always had perfect plans, but whose demise was never discussed.</p>
<p>The readers are often left bewildered when the faction with apparently the best war plan of the war suddenly lost or agreed to an unfavorable political settlement. In the current book, I narrate the KPNLF story based on interviews and correspondence with military commanders, examination of the KPNLF bulletins, as well as information provided by other factions who fought against the KPNLF during the war.</p>
<p>The dreaded Khmer Rouge is a complex faction. Unlike the other three factions, the Khmer Rouge history spanned the entire length of the Cambodian civil war from 1970 to 1999. I have already written about the military history of the Khmer Rouge in a previous book, although the length restriction and the availability of sources at the time did not allow for a full examination of the war between 1979 and 1991. Unlike the other two factions, the main difficulty with constructing the Khmer Rouge historiography is, counterintuitively, the abundance of primary materials. The Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam) holds what is perhaps the largest Khmer Rouge archive in Cambodia, if not the world, and it is largely accessible to scholars. Consequently, it is easy to mix up different periods, ignoring the different dynamics that affected the Khmer Rouge organization at different times.</p>
<p>For example, while studying the Cambodian resistance, thus denoting the period <italic>before</italic> 1991, Daniel Bultmann actually included some interviews about the soldiers&#x2019; views on the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s military organization <italic>after</italic> 1991.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_22"><sup>22</sup></xref> As a matter of fact, the Khmer Rouge boycotted the political process in 1991 and lost all foreign support, and its military organization changed accordingly. Therefore, the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s organization <italic>before</italic> 1991 was
<target target-type="page" id="page_11"/>drastically different from the one that operated <italic>after</italic> 1991, ideologically and militarily. It is not possible to guess the dynamics of its organization in one period by drawing inference from another period.</p>
<p>What these examples tell us is that any study relying on sources coming from only one faction is bound to be incomplete. Thus, this book will employ primary sources originating from all four factions. The first collection of the primary materials used by this book has never been examined by any scholar before. It belongs to the de facto government that was supported by the Vietnamese, the People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). The PRK&#x2019;s military, the Kampuchean People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Army (KPRA), was perhaps the largest military in the Cambodian civil war after the PAVN. The first type of primary materials from this faction is the collection of official unit history that was published by the newly established Institute of Military History of the Cambodian Ministry of National Defense. Because it was written in peacetime after units of all factions were integrated together, these documents not only contain the history of the KPRA, but also that of the resistance groups who now have become part of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. As deputy director of the institute from 2013 to 2015, I have been personally involved in almost all of the interviews conducted in the process of constructing these documents.</p>
<p>Apart from this official job, I have also conversed and interviewed many other former officers during various personal research trips. In all, the interviewees include: former battalion commanders, former regimental commanders, former divisional commanders, the former deputy chief of general staff, former officers of the offensive (operations) section of the General Staff Headquarters, former militiamen, commanders of district military, commanders of provincial military commands, and commanders of military regions.</p>
<p>The second type of primary materials related to the KPRA is the official newspaper called the <italic>Revolutionary Army</italic>, which was later changed to the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> (for the sake of simplicity, the book will use the latter name throughout). I possess the issues in this newspaper from 1979 to 1991 (except the year 1983, which could not be found). Once again, this source has never been examined by any previous scholar. The third and similar type is the collection of the PRK&#x2019;s state news agency, SPK bulletin (<italic>Sar Pormean Kampuchea</italic>, Khmer for &#x201C;Kampuchea Newspaper&#x201D;), which was divided into three categories. The version with the &#x201C;Blue&#x201D; cover was the collection of international news. The version with the &#x201C;Red&#x201D; cover was intended for public dissemination and contained a high level of propaganda. The &#x201C;Green&#x201D; version, however, is marked &#x201C;For Internal Reflection, Not for Public Dissemination&#x201D; and generally contains unfiltered versions of articles selected from foreign mass media. As a result, many news articles were sharply critical of the PRK itself and even claims of KPRA battlefield defeats were reported in full. Occasionally, the Green version contained summaries of announcements by the minister of homeland defense about the updates of military situations.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_12"/>The fourth type is the collection of photos, raw video footage, newsreel, and televised interviews that I had received from many officers of the four factions throughout the years. I am very grateful for their support. This footage constitutes important pieces of history because in most cases, they mentioned names, dates, locations, and events, all of which are crucial elements in the study of battle and campaign analysis. Once again, these sources, just like many sources originating from the PRK, have never been examined by any scholar before.</p>
<p>The second collection of material belongs to the resistance movements. For each of them, I rely on the official bulletins during the war (from the 1980s until 1991) and these are complemented by additional interviews with former military commanders (from the battalion level upward). For the Khmer Rouge, in particular, I will make extensive use of its bi-monthly bulletins, which are fully illustrated in color and narrated the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s significant activities every two months. Each issue exhibited pictures and accompanying captions that contain the explanation of events and dates. I was also able to obtain some video footage, the most interesting of which was shot by Khmer Rouge news crews during their capture of the town of Pailin in 1989. In the video, the narrator showed and described the mat&#x00E9;riels they had captured. More specifically, they had counted and shown the tanks that had been captured. This could be used to compare with other sources (written or interviews) to paint a clearer picture of how the battle unfolded, as well as the aftermath of the battle.</p>
<p>For the KPNLF, I have received tremendous support from a former highranking officer in the Khmer People&#x2019;s National Liberation Armed Forces&#x2019; General Staff Headquarters, whose correspondence allows me to fully understand the movement. Some rare photographs were also obtained from him. This officer wished to remain anonymous. I am very grateful for his assistance and will withdraw any reference to him as per his request. I also would like to assure him that the KPNLF&#x2019;s true history, or the closest version thereof, will be properly recorded. I also conducted two long inter views with the late General Dien Del before his passing in 2013. In addition, I was also able to interview several former regimental commanders who had been with the KPNLF since 1979.</p>
<p>As for the FUNCINPEC, I rely mostly on its ANS bulletin (<italic>Arm&#x00E9;e Nationale Sihanoukhiste)</italic> as well as the collection donated by former King Sihanouk to the <italic>Archive National du Cambodge</italic>. This type is complemented by the biography of former commanders as well as interviews with former battalion commanders of the ANS.</p>
<p>Lastly, to seek objectivity in the combination of all of these sources, I will also employ alternative sources that could be considered neutral by the standard of the war, i.e. foreign newspapers. The largest collection of materials used is the news archives of the <italic>Far Eastern Economic Review</italic> (FEER) from 1979 to 1991. The FEER was a respectable regional magazine at the time and ran approximately one article on Cambodia in every issue.
<target target-type="page" id="page_13"/>The magazine struggled in the 2000s with the advent of electronic mass media and was finally forced to terminate its operations in December 2009 as it could no longer compete with internet readership. Nevertheless, the stories it covered in the 1980s and 1990s remain valuable to any researchers of the Cambodian civil war.</p>
<p>This book will try to ascertain the authenticity of events to be used in the campaign analyses based on the combination of all these materials. One advantage of being a Cambodian scholar is the ease with which I have been able to visit the former battlefields. Surely, a lot has changed in the last twenty-six years, but some terrain features remain unaltered, which have allowed me to conduct what could be tentatively called &#x201C;staff ride.&#x201D; The classic staff ride was pioneered by the Great General Staff of the Prussian army under Helmut von Moltke the Elder. Its main objective was to familiarize students who would later serve in the Great General Staff to understand the terrain that might be involved in future war.</p>
<p>The methodology I use in this book, however, is more closely associated with the staff ride as conducted by the US Army&#x2019;s Combat Studies Institute at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. As a graduate of the US Army Command and General Staff College, I was first exposed to this methodology during my command and general staff course there, participating in the Battle of Gettysburg staff ride and playing the role of Confederate General James Longstreet. In this methodology, we do not study the terrain that might be involved in future conflict, but rather we study historical battles and draw insights in terms of decision-making, effects of the terrain on the battle, or the relationship between weapons technology and tactics. As a participant in this great exercise, I was amazed by how our views of events completely changed once we arrived at the actual battlefield. Some decisions look so stupid and insane on paper but they are probably the best ones able to be made, given the nature of the actual terrain. Therefore, I strongly believe that any author who wants to study battles must visit the battlefields at least once to get a sense of what the fighters were facing when they faced off against each other.</p>
<p>But a good staff ride in the Fort Leavenworth fashion must be supported by a huge amount of historical materials and the details of this battle are largely known already. Participants simply put themselves in the shoes of the commanders and try to understand why and how the battle unfolded as it did. The battles of the Cambodian civil war between 1979 and 1991 and especially between 1989 and 1991, have never been studied before. Therefore, a Fort Leavenworth-style staff ride would be impossible within the Cambodian context. I did not attempt to conduct such a staff ride to construct the battlefield narrative in this book. Instead, I only used the insights I gleaned from participating in that staff ride to help me better walk the terrain and know what to look for. Therefore, in this book, after gathering the evidence and writing the first draft of the battle narrative, I then proceeded to walk the terrain to get a sense of where things were and
<target target-type="page" id="page_14"/>what the fighters actually encountered during the thick of battle. This novel methodology paid great dividends.</p>
<p>For example, an officer claimed that during an attack in 1990, one Khmer Rouge division (around three hundred soldiers only in the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s inflated organization) got bogged down as it tried to cross a bridge in Kampong Thom province. I then went to that bridge and calculated whether the heavy machine gun emplacement and the recoilless rifle gun on top of a water tower nearby could have fired on the troops at the bridge. The result showed that the infantry assault occurred within the effective range of the weapon emplacements on top of the water tower. In technical military terminology, the advancing infantry was in the &#x201C;kill zone&#x201D; of the heavy weapons.</p>
<p>A similar case happened in Battambang when a former officer claimed that the Khmer Rouge placed a recoilless rifle on the tank and fired on his divisional headquarters to harass the troops. Again, one needs to go to the battlefield and determine if this account is within the realms of possibility. In some other places such as Road 69 in Banteay Meanchey province, which surrounding remains more or less unchanged from 1990, it was a matter of driving along that road to determine if it was really militarily indefensible as many people had claimed.</p>
<p>In summary, written archives, newspaper, bulletin, interviews, open publications (unit history), historical photos, archive video footage, and my personal visits to the former battlefields are combined to produce each battlefield narrative in this book.</p>

<title>Military jargon survival kit</title>
<p>This section is designed to give some technical background and conceptual framework for readers who are not military professionals, have never been trained in the military, or are not students of security studies, to better understand the war in Cambodia. These concepts are crucial in understanding the &#x201C;why&#x201D; question, i.e. why did some factions succeed while others did not? The first framework is the relationship between politics and war. This section will discuss how military theorists understood how war should be fought and for what purposes. Also of particular importance is the relationship between guerrilla warfare and conventional warfare, and how both could be used to achieve the political purpose in a war of national liberation where the weaker side tries to overcome the stronger one. The war in Cambodia is a story of how both sides used this concept of a &#x201C;People&#x2019;s War&#x201D; to try to overcome each other. War transcended conventional battlefield tactics, and truly touched on capturing the hearts and minds of the people.</p>
<p>The third issue is the role of the tank. In most cases, a single weapon system does little to determine success on the battlefield. But in the impoverished battlefields of Cambodia, the tank is the premier limousine of war. It almost attained a sacred status, so much so that the resistance movements
<target target-type="page" id="page_15"/>typically equated the immobilization, destruction, or capture of the tank with significant success. The sub-section below will show that the resistance movement did this without thinking about the burden that came with capturing a tank: logistical arrangements, tactical doctrines, and the overall balance of force. The tactical use of the tank will be explained below to help readers understand how capturing the tank is only a psychological boost, not a decisive victory. This is to disabuse the notion that the resistance movements were on the brink of victory simply because they had captured some tanks from the enemy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_23"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
<p>The last sub-section will explain the basics of military organization and familiarize the general readers with the jargon of military organizations. We shall discuss the organization of the regiment, the division, and the general staff headquarters as well as the role and organization of the functional and support units. Readers will see that as the size of a military organization becomes big enough, so does the need for command, control and communication to be as good as possible. These things become exponentially more complicated when different military organizations attempted to pool resources under a unified or joint command. The major argument of this book is that politics is very important if one wants to carry out a People&#x2019;s War. Yet, politics is just a necessary condition; it is not a sufficient one. To capture power, one also has to think about military organization, which is not an easy thing to do.</p>

<title>People&#x2019;s War</title>
<p>In the 1980s, Cambodia was a poor country and even that is a gross understatement. The Khmer Rouge virtually left everything in ruin; both the physical infrastructure and the fabrics of society itself were severely damaged with the intellectuals being the prime targets for elimination in order to build a new and pure society. The war, therefore, followed this societal condition. This was not a war involving rich and developed countries. This was not a war fought by waves of tanks and fleets of attack aircraft and bombers. Cambodian armies barely had trucks to transport their troops to the front. Alas, the best modes of transportation were ox carts and elephants. This was a war fought by men and women who were barefoot, devoid of any standard uniforms or insignias.</p>
<p>For example, in one issue of the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> newspaper, an article mentioned a significant defection where the defectors brought a lot of material with them. The article noted that &#x201C;in October 1984, our People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Armed Forces have received 144 defectors, 114 guns, 6 canoes, and 3 bicycles.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_24"><sup>24</sup></xref> Apparently, three bicycles and six canoes were considered so significant that they merit a citation in the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> newspaper. The PAVN did fight using bicycles for support during the Dien Bien Phu campaign, but they had tens of thousands of bicycles. Three bicycles would have been insignificant in this comparison.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_16"/>When the PAVN marched into Cambodia, they were perhaps the most affluent army on the battlefield. The PRK, as well as the resistance movements, did receive war material from their respective sponsors over the course of the war, but heavy equipment was still wanting. In such an impoverished war, the winner was the one who was able to fight in spite of the lack of materi&#x00E9;ls; in other words, the one who could use manpower to make up for the lack of materi&#x00E9;ls. The situation, at least on the general level, became similar to the ones that prevailed in China and Vietnam as they fought against the Japanese and United States, respectively.</p>
<p>While one may argue that there were so many differences between those wars and the war in Cambodia, there was at least one similarity, namely that a significantly weaker side tried to fight against the stronger one. These historical events produced a theory of guerrilla warfare by Mao Tse-tung in China and Vo Nguyen Giap in Vietnam. Both called for the mobilization of the general populace to overcome a technologically more advanced enemy. Both dubbed their theories &#x201C;People&#x2019;s War&#x201D; theory. To a large extent, the war in Cambodia followed parts of these theories in the military organ ization of the two major factions. The KPRA and the Khmer Rouge were actually designed based on the People&#x2019;s War model.</p>
<p>The difference is that in China and Vietnam, the belligerents had different military organizations while in Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge and the KPRA were sibling disciples and used the People&#x2019;s War model to fight against each other. In this model, typically the weaker side will start with guerrilla campaign, gradually building its forces as a conventional army to match its stronger enemy. In essence, a People&#x2019;s War is protracted and guerrilla in nature. But in Cambodia, both the stronger side and the weaker side used People&#x2019;s War model, competing with each other to mobilize the masses to their cause and join their respective armies. This sub-section will begin the discussion with the concept of guerrilla war versus conventional war.</p>
<p>The term &#x201C;guerrilla,&#x201D; by definition, is more about tactics than strategy. A tactic of hit-and-run, avoiding the strong, attacking the weak, dispersing the enemy&#x2019;s concentrated forces, using the enemy&#x2019;s supplies, and protecting one&#x2019;s own forces etc. are only a few defining characteristics of guerrilla warfare. Indeed, conventional forces can also use small-unit tactics to disrupt the enemy&#x2019;s supplies or outflank a well-defended target.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_25"><sup>25</sup></xref> However, when the term &#x201C;guerrilla warfare&#x201D; is used, it normally denotes a case of asymmetric warfare in which one side is far larger and stronger than the other, prompting the smaller side to resort primarily to guerrilla tactics.</p>
<p>The first theorist to conceptualize modern guerrilla warfare was Mao Tse-tung. His theory could be approached from various levels. At the tactical level, this is a theory about how to conduct guerrilla warfare; it is about how a weaker side uses guerrilla tactics to defeat the stronger one. At the heart of the matter, however, this war is strategically a revolutionary war, an armed struggle intended to radically change society. Because of its revolutionary nature, and by definition, the guerrilla is a weaker side trying
<target target-type="page" id="page_17"/>to fight against the stronger, established authority (the government). Given his experience with the Japanese occupiers during World War II and the struggle against the Chinese nationalists, Mao theorized that guerrilla warfare is protracted in nature and needs to be conducted in three stages.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_26"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>
<p>In the first stage, the guerillas are typically too weak to mount any successful offensive against the government or established authority. Mao argued that in this stage, or what he called &#x201C;strategic defensive&#x201D; for the guerillas and &#x201C;strategic offensive&#x201D; for the government, the guerillas must build the political support of the people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_27"><sup>27</sup></xref> For Mao, because a smaller force attempts to fight a larger and more sophisticated enemy, the former must have the support of the people. This required an appealing ideology and effective political programs that could address the social and political grievances, thus capable of mobilizing the population. This appeal to the people will provide the guerrillas with recruits, sanctuary, resources and intelligence. In essence, this is a &#x201C;People&#x2019;s War,&#x201D; as the guerrillas intend to use manpower to overcome technology and material resources. This concept appears to be born out of Mao&#x2019;s assessment of the war against the Chinese nationalists and the Japanese occupiers, where the communists initially tried to overthrow the government without a broad-based popular support and failed disastrously, leading to the Long March.</p>
<p>Tactically, in this first stage, Mao maintained that the guerillas must accept the possible loss of many cities to the government forces: the guerillas must not try to defend these cities through fixed defense or they will be crushed (perhaps again drawing from Mao&#x2019;s own experience).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_28"><sup>28</sup></xref> The best course of action for the guerillas, according to Mao, is to mount mobile warfare.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_29"><sup>29</sup></xref> Mao assumed that by forcing the government to defend its rear supply line along stretches of railways and highways, significant government forces would be diverted from offensive operation, thus giving the guerrillas some breathing space.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_30"><sup>30</sup></xref></p>
<p>If the guerrilla does this correctly, then the war will enter the second stage, when the government still retains offensive capabilities but finds it increasingly difficult to mobilize these with low cost. Most likely, the government then becomes more and more averse towards taking the offensive. As a result, the government will contract its forces in order to consolidate the gains and hold on to the territories already under control.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_31"><sup>31</sup></xref> Mao called this action, &#x201C;strategic consolidation&#x201D; for the government, and this second phase is called &#x201C;strategic stalemate&#x201D; since both sides do not have the capacity to mount large-scale offensives. This stalemate then allows the guerillas to move into unoccupied or lightly occupied areas to implement their own &#x201C;pacification&#x201D; campaign by building their local authority and militias. The guerrillas should not engage in large-scale fighting since the government is still capable of mounting last-resort offensive actions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_32"><sup>32</sup></xref> In this stage, both sides will appear to divide the territory for control. All of these are possible only if the guerrillas succeed in building a strong political base and popular support in the first stage.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_18"/>Finally, the guerillas will reach the third and final stage, the &#x201C;strategic offensive,&#x201D; when the government loses its offensive capabilities and is on the strategic retreat. Positional warfare or fixed defense will become necessary, and the guerillas will expand the areas under their control, this time by fighting to hold on to those areas. As the name implies, the main objective in this stage is purely military from the guerillas&#x2019; point of view, which would result in them trying to seize power through large-scale engagements. In other words, in the third stage, the guerrillas &#x201C;graduate&#x201D; to the conventional level, and the war becomes a conventional one (i.e. a conventional army faces off against another conventional army). This book asserts that when studying guerrilla warfare, scholars must determine when this &#x201C;operational graduation&#x201D; occurs and whether it is timely or not.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese model of People&#x2019;s War closely followed the Chinese model. But the Vietnamese theory, as articulated by General Vo Nguyen Giap, delved deeper into the detailed political and military organization of the war. The Vietnamese model is based on a concept dubbed &#x201C;&#x0111;&#x1EA5;u tranh,&#x201D; Vietnamese for &#x201C;the struggle.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_33"><sup>33</sup></xref> According to Douglas Pike, this concept combined &#x201C;armed &#x0111;&#x1EA5;u tranh&#x201D; (which consisted of a hybrid application of guerrilla war and conventional war) and &#x201C;political &#x0111;&#x1EA5;u tranh&#x201D; (which includes armed political actions among friendly units, enemy units, and the population).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_34"><sup>34</sup></xref> In other words, the concept blends political actions with military power.</p>
<p>Similar to Mao, Giap&#x2019;s concept of People&#x2019;s War was much influenced by his war experience against the Chinese nationalists (the contingent that operated in northern Vietnam), the Japanese, the French, and later the United States.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_35"><sup>35</sup></xref> Ironically, throughout most of his career, Giap was repeatedly faced with the insistence from his comrades to launch early conventional offensives. Most of those operations were premature and were defeated by the stronger enemy. Going a level deeper than Mao, Giap drew the lessons that the odds of the conventional offensive being successful largely depends on the maturity of the political situation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_36"><sup>36</sup></xref> Without broad-based support of the population, the conventional offensive tends to fail against the technologically stronger enemy. So, choosing the timing of the operational graduation is crucial.</p>
<p>This is where there is a break between the People&#x2019;s War as understood in the Socialist bloc and the less well-known People&#x2019;s War in the Free World tradition. This break was nowhere more evident than the war in Cambodia from 1979 to 1991. Early, we postulate that the communist factions, the Khmer Rouge and the KPRA both used the People&#x2019;s War model as developed by Mao and Giap. To be fair, even the Cambodian non-communist factions also boasted that they, too, were followers of the People&#x2019;s War model, albeit a Taiwanese one.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_37"><sup>37</sup></xref></p>
<p>After the Chinese nationalists were defeated and chased out of mainland China by the People&#x2019;s Liberation Army in 1949, it seemed that Chiang Kai-Shek took special interests in the communist model and actually developed
<target target-type="page" id="page_19"/>his own version of People&#x2019;s War. But there was a crucial difference between the two versions, at least as they were applied in Cambodia from 1979 to 1991. Based on the writing of and interviews with the former officials of the non-communist resistance movement KPNLF, its &#x201C;political warfare school&#x201D; emphasized that their political campaign was to accompany armed resistance and it must be people-oriented.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_38"><sup>38</sup></xref> However, no other detail was offered.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, in Mao&#x2019;s and Giap&#x2019;s People&#x2019;s War models, the guerrillas or revolutionaries, especially military officers and propagandists are required to understand what they called &#x201C;contradictions&#x201D; in society. Especially visible in Giap&#x2019;s writings, and taken from the Marxist description of the same concept, &#x201C;contradiction&#x201D; is a social reality, the driving force that pushes society to revolutions and changes. The guerrillas were then instructed to exploit these contradictions, transform them into grievances to mobilize people for war. For example, Giap noted that one contradiction in Vietnam was the fact that the country was dominated by the peasants while Vietnam was run like a feudal society and it was the landlord class that owned most of the land.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_39"><sup>39</sup></xref> According to Giap, this contradiction could be transformed into grievances, something the guerrillas could exploit in order to mobilize people for their causes.</p>
<p>All over the country, however, the political situation might not be the same from province to province.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_40"><sup>40</sup></xref> The fact that a revolutionary movement in one province could launch a conventional offensive does not mean that other movements in other provinces could do the same. The contradiction might be different, so also is the nature of the grievances. The guerrillas, in Giap&#x2019;s theory, must be able to grasp this situation before deciding on the appropriate level of armed resistance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_41"><sup>41</sup></xref> In essence, in stage two of the People&#x2019;s War, Giap&#x2019;s theory was more detailed than Mao&#x2019;s formulation. Both, however, were very concerned about the appropriate time for the operational graduation, the start of the stage where the guerrillas become a conventional army launching conventional offensive to take power.</p>
<p>In all, the communist version of People&#x2019;s War does not only consider the people to be important, it also actively requires the guerrillas to seek out the contradictions, and then transform them into grievances and exploit them to mobilize people for the cause. This, in turn, requires that the military itself exhibits exemplary discipline, branding themselves as the servants of the people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_42"><sup>42</sup></xref> This is the concept of &#x201C;political &#x0111;&#x1EA5;u tranh&#x201D; where the political actions were applied in the military to try to build a disciplined army. The communist military establishments created the institution of &#x201C;political commissar&#x201D; precisely to manage these political actions within the military chain of command as well as the rank-and-file.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_43"><sup>43</sup></xref> In the Western World tradition of People&#x2019;s War, &#x201C;political warfare&#x201D; is just one branch of the army. In contrast, in the communist version, the original version of People&#x2019;s War, political warfare is the heart and soul of the army, the basis on which a revolutionary war is to be conducted.</p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_20"/>We shall end this section by quoting a description of what effects the application of the People&#x2019;s War concept might have had on the communist fighters in Vietnam. In the wake of the attack on the US Embassy in Saigon during the Tet Offensive in 1968, American news channel, NBC reported:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Viet Cong commandos who attacked the US Embassy and other key places in downtown Saigon were ready and willing to die. They expected to die. In this war, a man willing to die is the most dangerous weapon. There is no way the Americans can mass-produce this weapon for their South Vietnamese ally, not with technology, not with money.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_44"><sup>44</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To be clear, it was not communism that stirred such ferocity, it was social and political grievances. In the People&#x2019;s War model, the communists just happened to focus on exploiting those.</p>

<title>Politics and war</title>
<p>The Western World is not totally na&#x00EF;ve on the theory of war, however. Perhaps the most famous and elegant, but also less well-understood, war theory is that of the Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz. A witness of the Napoleonic War and the fragile existence of the Prussian state, Clausewitz was perplexed by the mysterious and often unpredictable nature of war. Writing in a dialectical style, his unfinished, but famous, book <italic>On War</italic>, is a timeless work that can still explain the dynamics of war today.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_45"><sup>45</sup></xref></p>
<p>The first Clausewitzian formulation is &#x201C;war is a mere continuation of politics by other means.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_46"><sup>46</sup></xref> For Clausewitz, war is a serious matter and ought to be fought for serious political purposes. This is so because the more intense the war becomes, the more sacrifice the state needs to ask from society. Without a worthy cause, and a clear policy that society thinks is worth the sacrifice, the state will find it incredibly difficult to prosecute the war. Above all, Clausewitz believed that winning a war largely depends on the management of three major elements: the army, the policy (or strategy), and the people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_47"><sup>47</sup></xref> If there is a problem in one or more of these elements, victory is unlikely. A successful war, according to Clausewitz, tends to be one where the state has realistic and feasible strategic objectives, the army is capable enough to achieve said objectives, and the people are behind the state and the army.</p>
<p>Certainly, this is an ideal state that seems too good to be true. In war, Clausewitz warned against the belief in the &#x201C;perfect plan&#x201D; to win the war. He introduced the concept of &#x201C;frictions,&#x201D; about which he wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>Everything in war is very simple, but the simplest thing is difficult. [&#x2026;] Countless minor incidents&#x2014;the kind you can never really foresee&#x2014; combine to lower the general level of performance, so that one always falls far short of the intended goal.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_48"><sup>48</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_21"/>The policy&#x2013;army&#x2013;people trinity could be perfect at the beginning of the war, but as the war intensifies, it could easily be broken, especially the people&#x2019;s morale when the war starts producing casualties.</p>
<p>But the concept of friction is applicable down to the tactical level as well. One must always plan for the worst because a perfect plan simply does not exist. The enemy is generally smart and he also wants to win, thus he keeps guessing and countering your own plans. The clever enemy, in the Clausewitzian conception of war, is a major source of friction. There are two ways to mitigate the negative effects of friction. The first one advocated by Clausewitz involves attacking with utmost effort so that even if the effort falls short, it might still be in the acceptable realm.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_49"><sup>49</sup></xref> But another way to counter friction is to have resources in reserve to remedy the situation when events do not unfold according to plans. In the impoverished battlefield of the Cambodian civil war, both of these measures mean manpower.</p>
<p>In order to wrestle control from the state, the resistance movements (i.e. the guerrillas) would require major campaigns and conventional offensives at some point. And the larger the campaign or the more complicated it is, the more serious friction could become. To have a better chance of winning the war, one must have a large pool of manpower to use in the offensive, as well as in reserve, in order to prepare for frictions when launching the major conventional offensives. This, in turn, requires careful and effective political actions just like Mao, Giap, and Clausewitz had suggested. In essence, a People&#x2019;s War is a political&#x2013;military struggle. Such was the nature of war in Cambodia from 1979 to 1991.</p>

<title>The role of the tank in the Cambodian civil war</title>
<p>Revered and dreaded in equal measures, the main battle tank has always been an important variable in the Cambodian civil war. However, as noted, it is usually incorrect to point to any single weapon system as the decisive factor that can affect the outcome of war. But in Cambodia, tanks have always played a major role, so much so, that many warriors considered them to be a battle winner. This importance requires us to discuss briefly how a tank can be used on the battlefield and the requirements for each tactical doctrine to work effectively.</p>
<p>Tanks have traditionally been fearsome foes for any infantryman that has to defend against them. Any assault that involves tanks tends to be a major one. But the presence of the tanks could also cloud the judgment of scholars, especially when they are led to believe in things like &#x201C;the guerrillas lost because they did not have tanks.&#x201D; In reality, while the tank is a fear some weapon platform, it is wrong to believe that the tanks are invulnerable. If a tank moves into a group of infantrymen with high density of anti-tank weapons, the tank would not last even a minute. If there is no anti-tank weapon, the infantry could resort to anti-tank mines. Failing that, infantry men could resort to cutting supply lines, denying the fuel and
<target target-type="page" id="page_22"/>ammunitions supplies. After all, a tank that cannot move is as good as a destroyed tank.</p>
<p>Above all, tanks do not automatically command success on the battlefield. Success will also come from good logistical arrangements, training, and doctrine. First, tanks voraciously consume fuel. Without good logistical arrangement, the tank will lose mobility and will become a liability. The second issue is tactical doctrine: how is the tank to be used and for what purposes? The resistance movements in Cambodia learnt the hard way that mere possession of the tanks did not necessarily guarantee victory.</p>
<p>Historically, tanks could be used in three major ways. First, the tanks are used in combined armed warfare to fight methodical battles.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_50"><sup>50</sup></xref> In this doctrine, the tanks are always used with infantry, with both arms protecting and supporting each other during assault. Due to the slow infantry movement, the tank will also have to move slowly. The synchronization is necessary to ensure mutual protection and support between the two arms. Also due to this slow and methodical operational tempo, the operation could be supported by artillery from static firebases. In this tactical doctrine, mobility is sacrificed for firepower and protection. This usually happens when the attacking force launches a frontal assault on fortified positions. In Cambodia, during the dry season offensive in 1983&#x2013;1984 and 1984&#x2013;1985, the PAVN adopted this doctrine in the assaults against the resistance movements&#x2019; strongholds.</p>
<p>The second doctrine was well known to Western scholars: the <italic>blitzkrieg</italic> battle plan, German for &#x201C;lightning war.&#x201D; The blitzkrieg doctrine instead traded protection for speed and mobility to provoke fear and shock in the enemy&#x2019;s formations and induce its collapse. The infantrymen that accompanied the tanks then needed to either be mechanized or motorized to keep up with the tanks, which severely restricted the number of troops that could go with the tank. In this doctrine, the attacker would concentrate forces at a narrow sector, pierce the front line, and move deep into the defender&#x2019;s rear, paralyzing the defender&#x2019;s formation before he could react.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_51"><sup>51</sup></xref> Speed is of the essence. Because of this, firepower cannot be provided by static artillery firebases (who cannot keep up with the tanks) but has to be supplied by an able air force. This, in turn, requires air superiority during the assault.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_52"><sup>52</sup></xref></p>
<p>In other words, this is an expensive and complicated operation, indeed a high-risk, high-payoff operation. Germany was able to defeat France in 1941 in only six weeks as the French and British failed to react with any decisive blow. In Cambodia, blitzkrieg occurred in 1979 when the PAVN defeated the Khmer Rouge and pushed them to the Cambodian-Thai border. The Vietnamese publications and foreign media described the campaign as &#x201C;Blooming Lotus,&#x201D; due to the fact that the PAVN attacked narrow sectors and then expanded its control afterwards, like a blooming lotus, hence the name.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_53"><sup>53</sup></xref> But in reality, it was a classic blitzkrieg.</p>
<p>The third way in which the tank could be used was a rather improvised doctrine, quite unknown to the Western military literature, but is frequently
<target target-type="page" id="page_23"/>found on the impoverished battlefields of the Third World countries. James Quinlivan called it &#x201C;large-caliber, drive-by shootings.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_54"><sup>54</sup></xref> In this doctrine, the tank is exclusively used for its firepower, which can be moved to anywhere on the battlefield. For most of the war in Cambodia, this was one of the most favored tactics. Sometimes, the soldiers employed the 100mm rifled gun on the T-54 main battle tank; at other times, they made use of the 76.2mm rifled tank gun on the PT-76 medium amphibious assault tank. In some cases, soldiers on both sides mounted recoilless rifles on the tank and the tank itself was transformed into mobile artillery.</p>
<p>During the Cambodian civil war, blitzkrieg was used only once by the PAVN in 1979. For the rest of the war, the high-caliber, drive-by shooting was the most favored tactic. Things changed, however, after 1989. The resistance movements started to receive modern anti-tank guns from their sponsors, specifically, the German-made Armbrust and the 84mm M2 Carl Gustav recoilless rifle. As effective tank-killer weapons arrived on the battlefield in large numbers, the belligerent began to exercise caution when using tanks.</p>
<p>As the high-caliber, drive-by shooting doctrine became too dangerous, all sides started to shift to the methodical combined arms doctrine where tanks, infantry, and artillery would work together in slow operational tempo. But the resistance movements fared worse, because they were unable to come up with a suitable doctrine that could help them employ the tanks to achieve decisive victory. Armor doctrine was one of the challenges the resistance movements could not adapt to, as they struggled to transform their organization from a guerrilla army to a conventional army capable of launching major operations and decisively defeating its opponent in order to capture state power.</p>

<label>1.4.4</label>
<title>A note on modern military organization</title>
<p>Cambodia has seen almost all types of political and military organizations. The military organization of all sides was typical of modern armies. A unit was composed of three maneuver units (i.e. the fighting units) of smaller echelon. Thus, a corps (usually called &#x201C;Front&#x201D;) typically controlled three divisions, one division controlled three regiments, one regiment controlled three battalions, and one battalion controlled three companies. This pattern was usually repeated down to the squad. Sometimes, a special unit, the brigade, was established and functioned like a regiment, but the brigade had more strength and capabilities than a regiment. In Khmer language, the translation of brigade is &#x201C;small division,&#x201D; a name that is very telling. The establishment of a brigade is usually a compromise, because while one can have a unit that can function like a division, the brigade is small enough so that it is possible to create many of them.</p>
<p>While all of the echelons bear organizational resemblance, there is a major break at the level between a battalion and a regiment. At the regimental
<target target-type="page" id="page_24"/>level, the number of soldiers becomes large enough so that the regiment could have its own specialized units for combat support. Therefore, in addition to the maneuvering or fighting unit, at the regimental level we start seeing companies or platoons that are specialized in artillery, transportation, armor, anti-tank, or combat engineers. All of these units do not belong to the division, but are organic to the regiment itself. The major task of these specialized units is to support the fighting units and to make them more effective in carrying out their mission. As a result, the regiment has a headquarters to coordinate the cooperation and synchronization between these different arms. Units at lower level normally do not have such support units and when they need support they have to request to a higher level such as regiment or division. The regiment is the echelon where the support units are organic to the unit itself.</p>
<p>At the division level, things become more complicated. A division typically has three infantry regiments and a variety of other support units. Depending on the mission, the division could be augmented with an armor regiment or additional infantry regiment. Nevertheless, if a division has more than three regiments, then command, control, and communication could become a serious problem in major battle. In addition to the fighting regiments, the division would have around ten &#x201C;functional&#x201D; units, i.e. those that are organized to serve specific functions. Examples of the functional units include a communication battalion, artillery battalion, combat engineer battalion, medical battalion, air defense battalion, and reconnaissance battalion. Richer countries could afford to have expensive units such as combat aviation, armor, anti-tank, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN), military police, or special forces. During battle, one major task of the divisional headquarters is to allocate support to the different fighting units.</p>
<p>One can easily see that because the standard division has only three regiments, it tends to lose flexibility when the battlefield requires more than three targets. To solve this problem, military commanders usually organize a &#x201C;task force,&#x201D; which is an ad hoc arrangement of various sizes (typically battalion or regiment size). The soldiers, specialized units, and equipment (such as tanks and artillery) could be drawn from various different units, and the task force was established for a very specific mission and for a limited time. This is especially useful when the whole unit is preoccupied, but could also provide some surplus forces for the task force. All task forces had no name or number and are represented on the map in this book by the number of their parent units.</p>
<p>Another unit, the general staff headquarters, of which there is only one for an armed force, is generally organized as the foremost provider of functional units at the operational and strategic level. It could control some division or independent regiments (meaning the regiment does not belong to any division) but its main &#x201C;teeth&#x201D; are the functional units, which it could allocate to different battlefields. In Cambodia, the General Staff
<target target-type="page" id="page_25"/>Headquarters of the Kampuchea People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Army (KPRA) mostly allocated tanks, artillery, and multiple rocket launchers to the battlefields where the maneuver units needed them most.</p>
<p>The last point to note about military organization is the number of troops in the unit. This issue will be explained in detail in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter3">Chapter 3</xref>, but here it is necessary to highlight some preliminary cautions. The number of troops in one particular unit varied from one army to another. The Vietnamese units in Cambodia had the largest number of troops compared to units of the same echelon from other parties. A typical Vietnamese division had around 10,000 troops, while the KPRA division had only 5,000 troops on average. Command, control, and communication would become a serious problem if the division were larger than this. Other factions had a tendency to inflate the numbers in their organization. A division belonging to the army of Prince Sihanouk and the KPNLF had between 1,000 and 2,000 men, which was the equivalent of a KPRA regiment. The Khmer Rouge, on the other hand, had a complicated military structure. The largest division could have more than 2,000 troops while the smallest ones could have between three and five hundred soldiers. <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter3">Chapter 3</xref> will explain this issue in more detail.</p>

<title>Plan of the book</title>
<p>This book will narrate the history of the four factions in the Cambodian civil war, tracing their origins in the late 1970s until the final showdown between 1989 and 1991. The book will focus on an area that has received no attention whatsoever in the current literature, namely the military campaigns that underpinned the political negotiations from 1989 to 1991. Other crucial issues in the history of the four factions that have never been studied before will also be analyzed. This book is therefore divided into seven chapters. This first chapter introduces the book as well as some technical concepts.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter2">Chapter 2</xref> will condense the history of Cambodia from the 1960s to 1979. Because this period has received significant studies by other scholars already, major events will be explained only briefly. The value added that this book offers in that chapter is the origin of the Phnom Penh government, the People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea from when five anti-Khmer Rouge movements met on 2 December 1978 to establish a unified front (with Vietnamese support) to defeat the Khmer Rouge. <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter3">Chapter 3</xref> will narrate the political ideology, strategy, military organization, and tactical doctrine of the three resistance movements, namely Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s FUNCINPEC, the KPNLF and the Khmer Rouge.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_55"><sup>55</sup></xref> Among the three movements, the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC have already received ample attention. The value added of this book is the recording of some significant history of the KPNLF that has not received enough attention in the literature. The most important and novel point of the chapter is the study of the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s military
<target target-type="page" id="page_26"/>organization, political ideology, and tactical doctrine between 1979 and 1991. The chapter will also bring to light some crucial information on the Vietnamese dry season offensive in 1983, 1984, and 1985 and how the resistance movements adapted to the onslaught.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter4">Chapter 4</xref> is entirely dedicated to the PRK and its military, the KPRA. The Vietnamese military formation in Cambodia will also be studied, since it was the PAVN that helped build the KPRA. Most of the information in this chapter is new to the literature. <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter4">Chapter 4</xref> will submit a novel argument, namely that the KPRA had done well in protecting the state. Towards the later part of the 1980s, this army gradually stepped up and assumed the responsibility that hitherto had been taken by the PAVN. Vietnam played a key role in building the PRK but eventually it was the PRK itself that fought to ensure its own survival. The victory was not smooth and instead was punctuated by military rout, confusion, and panic, but it was a victory nonetheless.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter5">Chapter 5</xref> presents a campaign analysis of the major offensives that the four factions carried out in the aftermath of the Vietnamese withdrawal in 1989. Throughout the book, only major battles will be studied. The book defines &#x201C;major battle&#x201D; as a battle where the combined forces committed by both sides was at least a brigade (roughly 1,500 soldiers). This arbitrary measure is used because this book only studies battles that could be decisive, i.e. battles that could win the war. Of course, one should not underestimate the heroism of a group of ten fighters ambushing their enemy. Yet, the outcome of such small encounters is unlikely to have any significant impact on the overall war. With a regiment or a brigade, however, one side can capture a district. If that could be multiplied or expanded to the provincial level, then the war could be won. At least, such victories can still be used as bargaining chips during political negotiations. This measure also restricts the geographical areas that can be counted in this study, namely military regions 4, 5, and one exception in the military region 3.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter6">Chapter 6</xref> studies the residual battles, those that were fought not for winning the war but for capturing as much territory as possible, because the four factions had already agreed on the major points of the political settlement to end the war. The last chapter summarizes the lessons from the Cambodian civil war from 1979 to 1991 and conclude the book.</p>

<title>Acknowledgments</title>
<p>This book would not have been possible without the help and support from my family, professors, colleagues, and friends. First and foremost, I am very fortunate to have the support from my parents whose insistence on me studying both French and English from a very young age later helped me tremendously when I conducted research for this book. Their survival story and bitter memory also motivated me to uncover the true causes of the misery and the scourge of ideology that punished Cambodia for twenty-nine
<target target-type="page" id="page_27"/>years. My research here certainly cannot undo the afflictions that had occurred to my family, and to other families, but at least it can provide some closure, helping them and Cambodian society as a whole to understand one of the most terrible disasters in Cambodian history. Such is my personal aspiration for this book.</p>
<p>I would like to express my deep gratitude to my PhD dissertation chair, Dr. Stuart Kaufman and the PhD dissertation committee members Dr. Mark McLeod, Dr. Mark Miller, and Dr. Matthew Weinert for their guidance, valuable insights, and valuable efforts in ensuring that my PhD dissertation, which is the basis of this book, is free of major errors. It is my privilege to have constantly learnt new things in this laborious process. Ms. Lynn Corbett of the Department of Political Science and International Relations of the University of Delaware also deserves my acknowledgment for her administrative assistance and the formatting advice that she has provided to me during this laborious process.</p>
<p>I am also greatly indebted to my professor, Dr. Stuart Kaufman who was my foremost professor in security studies. Most of the campaign analyses that I have included in this book, as well as my knowledge on organization theory, have been much influenced by his lectures and my discussions with him over the years. Such skills prepared me well when I participated in the Summer Workshop on Analysis of Military Operations and Strategy (SWAMOS) organized by Cornell University and Columbia University in 2010.</p>
<p>The committee that oversaw my Master of Military Art and Science (MMAS) at the US Army Command and General Staff College also deserve special thanks. I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Joseph Babb, Dr. James Willbanks, and Mr. Bruce Reider for their guidance, valuable insights, and outstanding effort to ensure that my thesis is free of major errors. I am also indebted to Dr. Richard Faulkner, whose unwavering insistence on the need for students to reflect on the major lessons of historical military events, was a very important factor that enhanced my judgment of major military events in this book.</p>
<p>I would like to express my thanks to my fellow International Military Students of the US Army Command and General Staff College, Class 14&#x2013;02, especially Captain Tran Duc Huong of the People&#x2019;s Army of Vietnam, who provided assistance in the translation of some of the Vietnamese sources that I have used in my thesis.</p>
<p>Another important part of my book is the materials taken from the collections of various archives. I would like to express my thanks to Mr. Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam) for support and facilitation for my research. I also would like to thank Ms. Thida of DC-Cam, who helped me in this process. I would like to express my gratitude to the staff of the Ministry of Information, SPK, the <italic>Archive National du Cambodge</italic>, the Combined Arms Library at the US Army Command and General Staff College, and the Yusof Ishak
<target target-type="page" id="page_28"/>Institute for South East Asian Studies (ISEAS) at the National University of Singapore. For ISEAS, in particular, I would like to thank Liang Shuang who provided great help in arranging the archive materials for my consultation in the short time that I spent in Singapore for my research.</p>
<p>The unsung heroes of the war also deserve gratitude. This was a civil war. I am sure all sides had legitimate reason to fight, even though some of the elements might have had opportunist or ulterior motives for the fight (which is quite inevitable in any war). I endeavor to treat their struggles equally and I will avoid disparaging any movement. Many interviewees requested that both their names and if possible, the names of their former foes (especially the Khmer Rouge fighters) which they described in the interviews, be left anonymous. The main reason, they asserted, was to forget the bitter past in order to maintain a bright future together. We then agreed that in such cases, only the name of the units would be identified, and individual names will remain anonymous as per the request. I omitted the names out of respect for these officers and soldiers and I believe they could be better included if these sources become authors of their own biographies.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank the former officers and soldiers of the four factions who provided me with insightful interviews. They are unsung heroes of the nation and they are an important part of my book. In this book, I will put only &#x201C;former commander,&#x201D; &#x201C;former officer,&#x201D; &#x201C;former soldiers,&#x201D; &#x201C;former cadre,&#x201D; etc. instead of their real names. Anyone interested in fact checking can contact me personally for the details. Among these former officers, I would like to thank one KPNLAF officer in particular, who had served in a high-ranking position in the KPNLAF-FUNCINPEC&#x2019;s Joint Military Command. He wanted the history to be properly recorded but he thought that his name would only amplify the rifts of the past. This book will therefore record the true history without making reference to his name as per his request.</p>
<p>I would like to express my deep gratitude towards General Tea Banh, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, for his support of my historical work. I would also like to express my gratitude to General Nem Sowath. I wish to thank them for their support, understanding, and encouragement with regards to my effort in finishing this book.</p>
<p>I plan to save the best for last. I would like to thank my longtime friend, Dr. Mike Minehan, who has helped proofreading the entire manuscript as well as looking for any points that he does not understand. Writing a book is difficult in the sense that sometimes we write about something that we, the authors, know clearly and can easily understand without much explanation, all the while forgetting that we actually write for someone else to read. Thus, an uninformed outsider like Mike is necessary to fulfill that role. In fact, Mike is not totally an outsider. While not a political scientist or specialized in military affairs, he was a scholar. For twelve years, he was Head of Department (Communication) in the corporate division of the University of Technology Sydney. Dr. Minehan was so kind to agree to all
<target target-type="page" id="page_29"/>my requests without complaint. I am very fortunate to have such a great friend. Moreover, writing in a second language is never easy. The difficulties border on impossibility. In all of my major publications, Mike&#x2019;s name is always present, which is a testament to his kind assistance in making my writings readable to the general readers. The completion of this book would not have been possible without the help of my professors and my friends.</p>
<p>My students also deserve credit as wonderful research assistants. Mao Dina, Sek Sophal, Lim Menghour, Chan Sokunthea, and Rongsong Sodalin prepared the transcripts of the interviews. Tey Sovanaroth helped checking some remaining archives at ISEAS. In particular, I would like to thank Chan Peter who agreed to sit with me at a coffee shop on countless Sunday mornings and toiled over the digitization of all the maps used in this book. They are all part of a great team.</p>
<p>This book received help and support from many people. Yet, needless to say, the views expressed in this book are solely my own, drawn from my objective academic analysis and are in no way representative of the official positions of the Ministry of National Defense of Cambodia. The success of this book cannot be isolated from everyone who helped me in the process, but I assume all responsibility for any unintentional errors that might have occurred.</p>

<title>Notes</title>
<fn id="fn_1"><label>1</label><p>His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk was both king and head of state at the time. However, the conventional literature almost unanimously referred to the king as Prince Sihanouk. This book adopts this appellation to avoid confusion. It was also a fitting decision given the fact that most of the time from 1970 to 1993, the survival of the monarchy was often in doubt. It was not until 1993 that Prince Sihanouk once again became king.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn_2"><label>2</label><p>The Western literature often refers to the PAVN as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), northern regular soldiers, while the PLAF was contemptuously known as the Viet Cong, which was made up of local guerrillas in South Vietnam. This book adopts the historically neutral name of PAVN and PLAF.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn_3"><label>3</label><p>What Vietnam did in 1979 in Cambodia was controversial: liberation versus invasion (aggression). For survivors of the Khmer Rouge killings, the Viet namese action was a liberation. Even Prince Sihanouk also accepted a limited version of this story. For other forces, including the remnant of the Khmer Republic and the Khmer Rouge itself, what Vietnam did in 1979 was not liberation but an invasion, a blatant act of aggression on a sovereign nation. What was interesting was that the Cambodian non-communist forces, while condemning Vietnam&#x2019;s action as an aggression, did not actually accept the Khmer Rouge legitimacy as well. For them, both the Vietnamese and the Khmer Rouge forces were reviled in equal measure. This book believes there are merits in both sides of the argument and will not choose sides. Instead, this book will adopt a neutral term to describe the Vietnamese actions in 1979: intervention.</p></fn>

Mao Tse-tung, <italic>Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung: 5 Volumes</italic> (Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1967&#x2013;1969). Using the strategic interactions method, Mao argued that other external factors such as local and international political support, the enemy&#x2019;s morale (soldiers and civilians) and economic power need to be taken into account in order to win such a war. See Mao, <italic>Selected Works</italic>, vol. II, 137.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn_27"><label>27</label><p>Contrary to typical portrayal of his theory, Mao actually considers political support to mean both local and international political support.

This seems to be the middle ground between Mao (who was cautious in the use of regular units in early phases) and Che (who was not shy in using regular units), but it also mirrored Giap&#x2019;s application of his theory in Vietnam where the PAVN fought vigorously alongside the PLAF.

<title>The colonial heritage</title>
<p>A major part of modern Cambodian history is dominated by the complicated nature of Cambodian&#x2013;Vietnamese relations. History of violent relations between Cambodia and its neighboring countries, Thailand (formerly Siam) and Vietnam (formerly Annam), run deep through Cambodian collective memory. Seeing the potential danger of Cambodia being divided by the two hostile neighbors along the Mekong River, King Ang Doung of Cambodia (who came to the throne with Siamese support) began courting French authorities in Singapore around 1853.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Initially, this scheme was interrupted by Siamese threats, but in 1863, Cambodia had become a French protectorate.</p>
<p>Because of the French control, a large swath of territory known as Cochinchina (which was formerly Cambodian territory until the seventeenth century) eventually became part of the new Republic of Vietnam.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_2"><sup>2</sup></xref> This alarmed many Cambodians especially given the history of Vietnamese expansion from the southern border of China, known as the &#x201C;Southward March,&#x201D; which completely destroyed the Champa Kingdom in 1832.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_3"><sup>3</sup></xref> Many Cambodians saw the Vietnamese influence in its political affairs in the 1950s as potentially another episode in this expansion. This fear would come to engulf both the left-wing revolutionaries and the right-wing politicians.</p>
<p>Before the First Indochina War, the independence movement in Vietnam organized itself as the Indochina Communist Party (ICP). Between 1930 and 1954, a section of the ICP became the founding members of the future Cambodian leftist movement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_4"><sup>4</sup></xref> The Cambodian left-wing revolutionaries who would come to power later, considered the ICP as a Vietnamese ploy to dominate Cambodia.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_5"><sup>5</sup></xref> The Cambodian communist movement eventually organized its own party, the Khmer People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Party (KPRP), on 28 June 1951.</p>
<p>After Cambodia gained independence in 1953, Prince Sihanouk established the Sangkum Reastr Niyum party (Khmer for &#x201C;populist society party&#x201D;) and won a landslide victory in the general election in 1955. The KPRP also participated in the election, as did other minority right-wing parties, but did not win any seats in the national assembly. At this point, the communist movement in Cambodia had little hope of taking power from the popular
<target target-type="page" id="page_34"/>Prince Sihanouk. However, complicated international events soon changed that situation.</p>
<p>Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s rule came at a difficult time. In order to avoid the adverse effects of the Cold War, Prince Sihanouk adopted a policy of neutrality and non-alignment. However, despite this official policy declaration, events forced Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s foreign policy to fluctuate between support for the United States and North Vietnam.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_6"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
<p>In 1959, several right-wing politicians and military officers were implicated in a failed coup attempt against Prince Sihanouk.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_7"><sup>7</sup></xref> In his memoir, Prince Sihanouk wrote that he believed the US was behind the failed coup attempt.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_8"><sup>8</sup></xref> On 26 April 1965, Cambodia broke diplomatic relations with the US.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_9"><sup>9</sup></xref> Taking advantage of favorable conditions, North Vietnam tried to ensure that no communist movement in Cambodia threatened Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s rule in exchange for the Prince&#x2019;s acquiescence of its sanctuaries along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border. North Vietnam insisted that the Cambodian communists should adhere to a political struggle (i.e. low intensity and long term) rather than a coordinated political&#x2013;military one (i.e. potentially decisive).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_10"><sup>10</sup></xref> The KPRP&#x2019;s prospect for taking power was bleak. It had no army, no broad popular support, no external support, and the public wing of the party was under threat by the Cambodian regime.</p>
<p>It was amidst this confusion within the Cambodian communist party that a small group of new leaders emerged. These leaders would later establish the reign of terror in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 and bear the notorious name &#x201C;Khmer Rouge.&#x201D; The term &#x201C;Khmer Rouge&#x201D; started to appear in Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s speeches in the 1960s when he used the term to describe all Cambodian communists. &#x201C;Khmer&#x201D; denotes both the language of Cambodia and ethnic Cambodians while &#x201C;Rouge&#x201D; is the French word for &#x201C;Red,&#x201D; a popular denomination of all things communist.</p>

<title>The Radical Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK)</title>
<p>The communist movement in Cambodia was hit by one disaster after another. The KPRP participated in the general election in 1955, but did not win any seats in the national assembly. In addition, because Prince Sihanouk leaned towards North Vietnam in the 1960s, the latter cut off vital support to the communist movement in Cambodia to avoid antagonizing Prince Sihanouk. Finally, in 1962, the second man in the KPRP defected to the Cambodian government and helped the government hunt down many Cambodian senior communist leaders.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_11"><sup>11</sup></xref></p>
<p>According to one account, in the midst of this upheaval, twenty-one junior members of the KPRP met at a secret location in Phnom Penh in 1963 to draw up a charter for a new party.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_12"><sup>12</sup></xref> The leader of this junior group named Saloth Sar, alias Pol Pot, was elected the new general secretary of the KPRP. According to a veteran of the KPRP, upon assuming the position of general secretary in 1963, Pol Pot changed the name of the party from KPRP to the
<target target-type="page" id="page_35"/>&#x201C;Communist Party of Kampuchea&#x201D; (CPK) in an attempt to sever all connections with the ICP and the Vietnamese communists.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_13"><sup>13</sup></xref> Many positions in the party were occupied by people close to Pol Pot.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_14"><sup>14</sup></xref> People such as Keo Meas, who was a veteran of the KPRP and had close ties with the Vietnamese communists, did not hold any important post in the new party. Pol Pot changed the direction of the party and decided that armed insurrection was to be carried out in tandem with political action.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_15"><sup>15</sup></xref> To the dismay of his North Vietnamese comrades, this new policy meant that henceforth, the overthrow of Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s regime was on the Cambodian communist&#x2019;s political agenda.</p>
<p>While the communist movement in Cambodia undertook a revolutionary metamorphosis and secretly became the CPK, North Vietnam either did not know of, or paid little attention to, these developments. After all, it was already comfortable with the support it received from Prince Sihanouk. However, North Vietnam would soon come to regret this decision as the CPK shifted the policy towards the overthrow of Prince Sihanouk, thus driving a wedge between the Prince and North Vietnam.</p>
</sec1>

<title>Cambodia leaned right: policy shift towards the US</title>
<p>The implicit understanding between North Vietnam and Prince Sihanouk seemed to be that the Vietnamese revolutionaries could have free access along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border as long as they did not present any threat to the Prince&#x2019;s regime. However, that changed on 2 April 1968 when a violent revolt took place in Battambang province (northwestern part of Cambodia, cf. Map 2.1). The event started out as a local rebellion by farmers who had no connection whatsoever with the Cambodian communist insurgents. Responding to the abuse of power by local officials, farmers in a village called Samlaut attacked a military outpost, killing two soldiers and capturing many weapons.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_16"><sup>16</sup></xref> Pol Pot and his comrades took advantage of this situation and declared responsibility for leading the revolt in Samlaut, essentially an attempt to hijack the event and use it as a publicity stunt for his movement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_17"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>
<p>The Cambodian military responded to the revolt by attacking the villagers and burning houses, forcing hundreds or even thousands of farmers to flee into the nearby jungle and mountains. Prince Sihanouk received a detailed report on what had happened. As a result, he dismissed many local officials and forced his Prime Minister to resign.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_18"><sup>18</sup></xref> However, Prince Sihanouk simply could not ignore the fact that the communists claimed responsibility for leading the revolt. That suspicion was confirmed when, after Samlaut, revolts in other areas became more widespread.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_19"><sup>19</sup></xref> In the context of these simul taneous revolts, in addition to reports from some local authorities who had all the motivation to spin the information so that it would point the blame at others, Prince Sihanouk began to blame the communists for inciting the revolts.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_20"><sup>20</sup></xref></p>
<p>This caused a significant foreign policy shift. Prince Sihanouk began to move away from supporting North Vietnam. Rhetoric against the communists
<target target-type="page" id="page_36"/>increased, while the relations between Cambodia and the US started to improve. Cambodia and the US reestablished diplomatic relations on 11 June 1969, and in the last days of July, Cambodia sent a letter inviting President Nixon for an official visit to Cambodia. The government also imposed strict controls over the press to avoid antagonizing the US.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_21"><sup>21</sup></xref> Moreover, Prince Sihanouk authorized the Cambodian military to take actions against the Vietnamese revolutionaries along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_22"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
<p>North Vietnam, of course, could not be indifferent about these disturbing developments, because the loss of sanctuaries in Cambodia would prove disastrous for its campaigns in South Vietnam. On 5 July 1969, Huynh Tan Phat, Prime Minister of the newly formed, underground revolutionary government with links to North Vietnam, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, paid an official visit to Cambodia to conclude some economic and trade agreements. The main objective of the visit was an attempt to observe the situation and to defuse the tensions resulting from these recent developments. However, the attempt failed when Prince Sihanouk publicly denounced the Vietnamese communists after the visit.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_23"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
<p>As the specter of a complete strategic reversal loomed large, North Vietnam began to look to the remnants of the Cambodian communist party, which was now controlled by the largely unknown Pol Pot, in an attempt
<target target-type="page" id="page_37"/>to find former allies for support.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_24"><sup>24</sup></xref> Because Hanoi had no idea who Pol Pot was, it was faced with a dilemma: create a new, malleable Cambodian communist party to undermine Pol Pot and his CPK, thus further weakening the communist movement in Cambodia, or provide support, however temporary, to Pol Pot, at least until victory over the regime in South Vietnam was assured.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_25"><sup>25</sup></xref> Hanoi chose the second alternative.</p>

<title>Full-scale war: the coup of 1970</title>
<p>On 18 March 1970, when Prince Sihanouk was on an official visit abroad, the right-wing politicians and the military carried out a coup to depose the Prince. On that day, the legislature voted, under duress, to remove Prince Sihanouk from power. The National Assembly made this decision behind closed doors while paratroopers took up positions around the National Assembly.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_26"><sup>26</sup></xref> Soon after, the Khmer Republic was proclaimed.</p>
<p>The coup cut short the official visit of Prince Sihanouk in Moscow. Prince Sihanouk then flew to Beijing where he held a secret meeting on 21 March 1970 with Pham Van Dong (North Vietnamese Premier) and Zhou Enlai (Premier of the People&#x2019;s Republic of China).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_27"><sup>27</sup></xref> On 23 March, Prince Sihanouk broadcast a message from Beijing calling for his &#x201C;children&#x201D; (i.e. the Cambodian population) to go to the jungle and join the Maquis (a French term originated from World War II denoting resistance movement).</p>
<p>The coup in 1970 was unprecedented and provided a unique if somewhat ironic opportunity for Pol Pot. To be able to return to power, Prince Sihanouk had no choice but to rely on the communist Khmer Rouge. This enabled the Khmer Rouge to exploit Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s reputation to attract recruits and build its power base. The coup of 1970 effectively made the Khmer Rouge leaders the servants of Prince Sihanouk, while it positioned them for the future since it controlled the forces in the field. In addition, the Cambodian communists received military aid from both China and North Vietnam while their enemy, the Khmer Republic, received less and less aid from the departing American troops.</p>
<p>The Khmer new year of 1975 marked the final offensive on Phnom Penh. On 17 April 1975, the Khmer Rouge took the capital city. Their first step was the evacuation of the city.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_28"><sup>28</sup></xref> The evacuation marked the beginning of Pol Pot&#x2019;s paranoid and bloody reign. He believed that the &#x201C;enemies of the revolution&#x201D; were still hiding in the city, waiting to bring down the revolution after the war.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_29"><sup>29</sup></xref> He believed the evacuation would disrupt these internal enemies before they could act.</p>

<title>Democratic Kampuchea: Cambodia&#x2019;s dark age</title>
<p>Upon taking over, the Khmer Rouge established a new government called &#x201C;Democratic Kampuchea.&#x201D; This new government made a series of decisions that eventually led to its own demise. First of all, the Khmer Rouge turned
<target target-type="page" id="page_38"/>against Prince Sihanouk since the support for Prince Sihanouk among the Cambodian people was still strong. Second, Pol Pot never felt safe from foreign intrigues. For him, the threat of a Vietnamese takeover was still a distinct possibility. To deal with these problems, he had to eliminate all enemies, internal and external. The external enemy was Vietnam and the internal enemy included those who had any relations with Vietnam and who planned to destroy the revolution from the inside.</p>

<title>Prince Sihanouk: much vanity but no power</title>
<p>At the outset, the Khmer Rouge leaders sought to undermine Prince Sihanouk, who was seen as a liability and not trustworthy. In July 1975, the Khmer Rouge requested the return of Prince Sihanouk from China. Upon his return, Prince Sihanouk was immediately appointed as head of state of Democratic Kampuchea and even presided over a cabinet meeting.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_30"><sup>30</sup></xref> However, just like the cabinet meeting that the Prince presided over, the title of head of state was nominal only. A few weeks later, Prince Sihanouk was forced to go to the United States to petition the United Nations where he successfully reclaimed the Cambodian seat for Democratic Kampuchea.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_31"><sup>31</sup></xref> Not long after he returned to Cambodia, his requests to go to the countryside to meet his compatriots were repeatedly denied, and Prince Sihanouk finally decided to submit a request for resignation in 1976.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_32"><sup>32</sup></xref></p>
<p>In an internal meeting in March 1976, the Standing Committee of the CPK accepted the Prince&#x2019;s resignation. The Khmer Rouge leaders never trusted Prince Sihanouk, and they feared that, due to the Prince&#x2019;s immense popularity among the Cambodian populace (the Khmer Rouge cadres included), any contact between the Prince and the people would undermine their power. Prince Sihanouk survived under Democratic Kampuchea only because of the intervention of China. Nayan Chanda wrote that Mao Tse-tung understood that when Pol Pot took power, he would no longer need Prince Sihanouk and perhaps might even try to harm the Prince. Fearing this eventuality, the ailing Mao struggled with his failing health to speak to the sister-in-law of Pol Pot and told her not to send Prince Sihanouk and his wife to the cooperative (i.e. hard labor).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_33"><sup>33</sup></xref> This proved to be a lifesaver for the Prince and his family. After his resignation, Prince Sihanouk was held prisoner in his own palace, with no contact with the outside world, until January 1979 when Democratic Kampuchea collapsed.</p>

<title>Disaster of the Four-Year Plan (1977&#x2013;1980)</title>
<p>The Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s second major strategy was to reaffirm the collectivization of private property to maximize rice production. In early 1976, a Four-Year Plan (1977&#x2013;1980) was announced. The Khmer Rouge divided the land into two categories. Normal land was required to produce three tons of rice per hectare (approximately 2.47 acres), while the best quality land
<target target-type="page" id="page_39"/>was required to produce at least four to seven tons per hectare. It was this policy that led to famine and the brutal killing of people who were deemed enemies of the state because they could not meet the production target.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_34"><sup>34</sup></xref></p>
<p>Apart from this simplified system, the Khmer Rouge also established the &#x201C;cooperatives&#x201D; system, which was a collectivization of land and private property. The cooperative was a production unit that could cover many hamlets and villages, depending on the scale of the rice fields and the number of workers. The Khmer Rouge abolished the market system and replaced it with this cooperative system. The cooperative was the place where people worked for subsistence. The chief of the cooperative determined the daily food ration for everyone under his control, and the cooperative was the only place where eating was allowed. Anyone caught eating outside of the cooperatives would be considered a traitor to the party and the revolution. The offender would be arrested and executed. Thus, the chiefs of the cooperatives had the authority to kill anyone they deemed &#x201C;unnecessary&#x201D; to the revolution. There was no law under Democratic Kampuchea. Justice rested on the will and the mood of the cadres.</p>
<p>The Four-Year Plan collapsed almost as soon as it was implemented and that was the genesis of the genocide.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_35"><sup>35</sup></xref> The Four-Year Plan had three drastic consequences. First of all, it generated a famine. Second, as the laborers, weakened by malnutrition, could not work to raise production, they were either considered lazy or enemies of the revolution. Both of these offenses could easily lead to execution. Third, Pol Pot feared that the failure to meet targets must have been the conspiracy of internal enemies who plotted to overthrow the revolution. This led to many waves of purges, which devastated not only the ordinary people but also the Khmer Rouge cadres themselves.</p>

<title>Comrades at war: Vietnam&#x2019;s southern march must be stopped!</title>
<p>The very first clash between Democratic Kampuchea and Vietnam occurred on 1 May 1975 when a battalion of the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s 164th Division invaded an island south of the Cambodian coast that was claimed by both Vietnam and Cambodia.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_36"><sup>36</sup></xref> The attack was a debacle. Nevertheless, Vietnam did not take any large-scale retaliation for the event and still maintained diplomatic relations with Democratic Kampuchea. Perhaps still convinced that the Khmer Rouge was subscribing to the idea of world socialist revolutionary solidarity and the history of joint struggle, Vietnam did not take any major actions that might exacerbate the problem. However, the debacle following the invasion of the jointly claimed island only put a temporary halt to Pol Pot&#x2019;s anti-Vietnamese policy, and it took him just one year to organize another army to fight with Vietnam on a larger scale.</p>
<p>In spite of the disparity in the number of men under arms in Vietnam and Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge did not hesitate to pursue an adventurous policy
<target target-type="page" id="page_40"/>against Vietnam, because it believed its own propaganda that it had defeated the US in 1975. In this logic, war with Vietnam should go like clockwork. How the Khmer Rouge planned to overcome the Vietnamese numerical superiority can be discerned from a state radio broadcast on 10 May 1978. In this broadcast, the Khmer Rouge propaganda service briefed the nation about national defense situation between April 1977 and April 1978:
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]e are few in number, but we have to attack a larger force; therefore, we must preserve our forces to the maximum and try to kill as many of the enemy as possible. &#x2026; In terms of numbers, one of us must kill 30 Vietnamese. If we can implement this slogan, we shall certainly win. &#x2026; So far, we have succeeded in implementing this slogan of 1 against 30; that is to say, we lose 1 against 30 Vietnamese. &#x2026; We should have 2,000,000 troops for 60,000,000 Vietnamese. However 2,000,000 troops would be more than enough to fight the Vietnamese, because Vietnam has only 50,000,000 inhabitants. &#x2026; We must use one against 30. This is just the number fixed by the Party, but in concrete, deeds of some of our comrades fought 1 against 10; we shall certainly win with 1 against 10 or 1 against 5. Some of our people have fought 1 against 20, and some have even tried to fight one against 50 or 1 against 100. There was no problem; they were still victorious.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_37"><sup>37</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The mathematics were simplistic, if not totally absurd. However, not long after the above broadcast, military campaigns by the Khmer Rouge against Vietnam restarted.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_38"><sup>38</sup></xref></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge never ceased finding and eliminating suspected internal enemies. Suspects were arrested, tortured, and then forced to make new lists of suspects, which led to more purges. This purification policy destroyed the cadres of Democratic Kampuchea to a point where even the Chinese technicians who were sent to help the regime complained about the too frequent disappearances of their Cambodian counterparts.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_39"><sup>39</sup></xref></p>
<p>Between 1976 and 1977, small-scale clashes between Khmer Rouge troops and Vietnamese troops along the border were very frequent. Both sides exchanged diplomatic correspondence as well as meeting frequently to try to resolve the conflict. However, most of those sessions tended to degenerate into mutual accusations and nothing peaceful came out of those meetings. Finally, on 24 September 1977, the Khmer Rouge launched a furious, and perhaps the most brutal attack of the war, on Tay Ninh province, killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_40"><sup>40</sup></xref> Focused on domestic reconstruction, the Vietnamese still pursued negotiation.</p>
<p>On the ground, however, the Vietnamese were less lenient than in previous small skirmishes and retaliated on a large scale. The Vietnamese seemed to have sensed that a non-response would be interpreted as weakness, even though at the same time, the Vietnamese felt the need to leave the channel for negotiation open. The Khmer Rouge ignored the call for negotiation.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_41"/>On 6 December 1977, the Vietnamese conducted a coordinated counterattack with brutal efficiency and completely stunned the Khmer Rouge. One can gauge the severity of the situation by looking at one of the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s telegrams from the battlefield. On 23 December, one Khmer Rouge commander, comrade Phourng, noted that the Vietnamese moved in very quietly and achieved surprise in many places<italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_41"><sup>41</sup></xref></italic> Just fifteen minutes after the first telegram, Phourng relayed another message. The situation was getting worse:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the Yuon [i.e. Vietnamese] situation on the 22nd of December 1977, they pushed forward to capture the Krek rubber plantation in its entirety &#x2026; We lost contact with the rubber plantation and factory at Memot because the courier has not yet returned &#x2026; This Yuon force, according to [our] soldiers, consisted of many trucks and many tanks. The fighting occurred against our forces chaotically, in front and in the rear of our artillery positions, and we could not discern which side was ours and which side was the enemy&#x2019;s. According to my own analysis, we have lost control to a great extent, we lost communication between the troops and the command headquarters; and that was why the enemy could penetrate this deep with ease.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_42"><sup>42</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The Vietnamese army had moved in with only armor and motorized infantry. That was the reason why they could achieve breakthrough this easily. This was a classic blitzkrieg tactic. The Khmer Rouge operations probably ended in late December 1977. The following report reveals a total loss of control:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have a hole in the middle with no large formation of troops. The rubber plantation&#x2019;s militias could not fight and the big formations went to fight at the border for a long time and were now losing control and as we know, our brothers in the big formations were routed and could not yet establish communication.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_43"><sup>43</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In late December 1977, Democratic Kampuchea publicly announced the armed clashes with Vietnam to the world, as well as the fact that that it had broken off diplomatic relations with Vietnam. Vietnam unilaterally withdrew all of its forces from Cambodia despite gaining territory during the fight.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_44"><sup>44</sup></xref> As late as 1977, it seemed Vietnam still had not been prepared to undertake anything drastic because it was not able to conceive a political strategy yet.</p>
<p>Defeat on the battlefield was not the main problem for the Khmer Rouge, however. It was the new wave of purges that destroyed the regime. By simply looking at the reports that were coming in, one can see that the Vietnamese could easily penetrate the rear of the formations and effectively disrupt the Khmer Rouge supplies and artillery support. Once that occurred, the front formations collapsed. One can easily see that the Vietnamese triumphed
<target target-type="page" id="page_42"/>because of correct tactics, i.e. a blitzkrieg-type tactic. In the mind of the Khmer Rouge leaders, however, when campaigns initially ran so well and then immediately and inexplicably collapsed, this could only mean one thing: internal treachery that was perpetrated by Vietnamese sympathizers. Predictably, Pol Pot went out to destroy the internal enemies.</p>

<title>The East Zone put to the sword</title>
<p>In June 1977, when the Khmer Rouge was at war with Vietnam, internally, the purges of the cadres in an area along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, called the East Zone (a Zone was an administrative unit consisting of several provinces), was also under way. A junior Khmer Rouge commander in the East Zone named Hun Sen escaped to Vietnam after learning that his name was next on the execution list.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_45"><sup>45</sup></xref> He also wanted to seek support from Vietnam in order to return to Cambodia and defeat the Khmer Rouge.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_46"><sup>46</sup></xref> On 27 September, Hun Sen was allowed to meet with Lieutenant General Van Tien Dung, a member of the Politburo of the Vietnamese communist party, who was also the chief of staff of the PAVN.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_47"><sup>47</sup></xref> At the end of the meeting, however, no explicit pledge for support was given to Hun Sen.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_48"><sup>48</sup></xref> It seemed that as late as 1977, Vietnam still maintained some hope of negotiating with the Khmer Rouge. Perhaps that was the reason why Vietnam did not give any political or military support to the Cambodian refugees who had escaped to Vietnam.</p>
<p>For the Khmer Rouge, the year 1978 was eventful. It marked a much larger Khmer Rouge offensive against the Vietnamese. The most brutal attack of the war was launched in late February 1978 by the Southwest Zone and the divisions from the Central Committee of the CPK. According to one report, the second wave consisted of around 30,000 to 40,000 troops and was aimed at the Vietnamese Tay Ninh province.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_49"><sup>49</sup></xref> However, just like in 1977, the Khmer Rouge campaign in 1978 was a total disaster.</p>
<p>In April 1978, the PAVN responded in kind with a multidivisional counterattack. Unlike in 1977, the Vietnamese now used tanks in greater numbers, as well as air support.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_50"><sup>50</sup></xref> Khmer Rouge battlefield reports also revealed another important aspect of tactics used by the PAVN. In 1977, the Vietnamese moved swiftly with armor and motorized infantry to penetrate behind the Khmer Rouge lines, avoided strong points, and induced confusion and collapse of the main forward formations of the Khmer Rouge. In 1978, however, the Vietnamese pushed forward more slowly. While the Vietnamese counterattack in 1977 had been a blitzkrieg tactic, the counter-attack in 1978 was purely attritional. Perhaps, Vietnam wanted to weaken the Khmer Rouge as much as possible before involving the Khmer resistance groups organized from the refugees who had escaped to Vietnam.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_43"/>In April 1978, at the same time that the war reached its climax, Colonel General Tran Van Tra, the commander and chief political commissar of Vietnam&#x2019;s Military Region 7, told Hun Sen that the Vietnamese leadership had already agreed to provide support for a Cambodian resistance movement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_51"><sup>51</sup></xref> Accordingly, an armed force, the &#x201C;Kampuchean Solidarity Armed Forces for National Salvation,&#x201D; was established on 12 May 1978. Eventually, by recruiting the Cambodian refugees who escaped to Vietnam, the resistance movement had twenty-one infantry battalions, one all-female battalion, and one hundred armed operations groups, while the units of the headquarters consisted of a general staff section, a political section, a logistics section, a finance section, one special forces company, one medical com pany, and one unit for military bands.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_52"><sup>52</sup></xref> These forces operated out of the refugee camps in Vietnam&#x2019;s Long Giao province. These &#x201C;Long Giao battalions&#x201D; were the genesis units of the Kampuchean People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Army, one of the four factions to the war after 1979 (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter4">Chapter 4</xref>).</p>
<p>On 22 November 1978, the Cambodian resistance army (Kampuchean Solidarity Armed Forces for National Salvation) began drafting a political program to create a political movement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_53"><sup>53</sup></xref> The political movement was formally established in Kratie province on 2 December 1978.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_54"><sup>54</sup></xref> On Christmas day 1978, the Cambodian resistance army and the Vietnamese army combined forces for a final push into Cambodia to overthrow Democratic Kampuchea on 7 January 1979, ending the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s genocidal regime that had lasted for 3 years 8 months and 20 days.</p>

<title>Prince Sihanouk became useful to the Khmer Rouge once more: adding one more insult to injury</title>
<p>While the war on the border was raging, Prince Sihanouk was still kept in almost solitary confinement by Pol Pot. Nonetheless, in late 1978, Prince Sihanouk noted an unusual generosity and kindness on the part of the regime.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_55"><sup>55</sup></xref> At dusk on 5 January 1979, a senior Khmer Rouge leader came to the house and told Prince Sihanouk that Pol Pot had invited the Prince for evening tea.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_56"><sup>56</sup></xref> Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s relatives and the queen were worried that the invitation was the last one from the Khmer Rouge and that they would never see Prince Sihanouk again. But the Prince&#x2019;s star was still shining: Pol Pot needed the Prince more than anything. Upon arrival at Pol Pot&#x2019;s residence, Prince Sihanouk noted that Pol Pot was more courteous than ever before, prostrating himself to welcome the Prince, a standard Cambodian etiquette of respect for senior people and the royal family, something Pol Pot had never done before.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_57"><sup>57</sup></xref> He also addressed Prince Sihanouk as &#x201C;His Majesty.&#x201D; Pol Pot dropped a hint about what he wanted Prince Sihanouk to do:
<disp-quote>
<p>Comrade Khieu Samphan that Your Majesty had met before had told me that Your Majesty would be happy to represent our government at
<target target-type="page" id="page_44"/>the United Nations and defend the righteous cause of our people against invasion by the Yuon, in the (political) discussions that might take place in the Security Council &#x2026; of the United Nations.

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_45"/>Pol Pot then briefed Prince Sihanouk that the Vietnamese would soon capture Phnom Penh, but reassured the prince that it would not be a problem, as the Cambodian soldiers and people would soon chase the Vietnamese out.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_59"><sup>59</sup></xref> Ieng Sary and Pol Pot then carried out a &#x201C;good cop, bad cop&#x201D; routine to try to convince Prince Sihanouk of their sincerity.

<p>Pol Pot then gave Prince Sihanouk &#x0024;20,000 as pocket money for the mission, the money that the Prince returned in full after departing Democratic Kampuchea. In retrospect, we can see that the Prince had no choice but to agree. It was either take the money and leave, or perish under the Khmer Rouge for non-compliance.

The Khmer Rouge distinguished between the &#x201C;Old People&#x201D; or &#x201C;Base/Local People&#x201D; and the &#x201C;New People,&#x201D; or &#x201C;17 April People.&#x201D; The former were considered as the owners of the country, while the latter were considered as &#x201C;latecomers&#x201D; to the revolution.

<fn id="fn_35"><label>35</label><p>Three main reasons could explain why this Four-Year Plan failed. First, the people who were sent to the cooperative came from the cities and were not accustomed to either hard labor or even agricultural practices in general. Second, because the Khmer Rouge did not have any machinery to help with the cultivation, the productivity was dismal. Third, most arable land was ravaged by war and unexploded ordnance and landmines prevented a large-scale cultivation. See Nhem, <italic>The Khmer Rouge</italic>, 53.</p></fn>

<p>In the Cambodian Civil War, the de facto government, the People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) was supported by Vietnam and fought against an exiled government, the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), which was in fact a grand coalition of three resistance movements. The first group was the Khmer Rouge who retained its former name, Democratic Kampuchea. It called its armed wing the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK) or simply, the &#x201C;National Army.&#x201D; The second group was Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s resistance movement, the <italic>Front Uni National pour un Cambodge Ind&#x00E9;pendant, Neutre, Pacifiques Et Coop&#x00E9;rative</italic> (in English, the National United Front for a Cambodia that is Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative), mostly known by its French acronym, the FUNCINPEC. Prince Sihanouk also organized the armed wing of this movement called the <italic>Arm&#x00E9;e Nationale Sihanoukhiste</italic> (ANS), a testament of his distrust of the Khmer Rouge, following the bitter memories of the 1970s. Lastly, fearful of Vietnamese expansion to the southeast of its border, Thailand helped organize a resistance group called the Kampuchean People&#x2019;s National Liberation Front, or KPNLF with its armed wing, the Kampuchean People&#x2019;s National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF). This chapter discusses the military organization of all three parties belonging to the CGDK. The PRK will be discussed in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter4">Chapter 4</xref>.</p>

<title>The Khmer Rouge: from guerrillas to regulars, from regulars to guerrillas</title>
<p>The Khmer Rouge began as outlawed guerrillas. The 1970 coup created the conditions under which the Khmer Rouge became a liberation army claiming as its mission, the return of Prince Sihanouk to power. Members of the Khmer Rouge came into the hamlets and villages and started recruiting peasants who supported Prince Sihanouk.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> The organization at that time was designed and based on Chinese and Vietnamese guerilla units. They were organized as &#x201C;armed propaganda units,&#x201D; meaning that they had a dual mission&#x2014;to indoctrinate people about their cause, while retaining the ability to fight, should the situation demand it. These &#x201C;educators&#x201D; required little
<target target-type="page" id="page_50"/>training, as their mission consisted of going from village to village, singing revolutionary songs and spreading propaganda in order to help recruit the local population.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_2"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
<p>After the eventual Khmer Rouge victory in April 1975, the Kampuchea Revolutionary Army was established in Phnom Penh on 22 July 1975.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_3"><sup>3</sup></xref> This army had three layers. The first layer was the conventional units that were directly controlled by the Central Committee. In March 1977, this army had nine divisions: 703, 310, 450, 170, 290, 502, 801, 920, and 164.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_4"><sup>4</sup></xref> A division had between four thousand and six thousand soldiers. Each of these divisions had a unique three-digit numerical designation, which distinguished them as troops of the Central Committee.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_5"><sup>5</sup></xref></p>
<p>The second layer of military power of Democratic Kampuchea was at the regional level. Both the Region (province) and Zone (several provinces) had their own military units. The Zone could organize only one division or brigade to carry out operations in its area of responsibility. The Region typically had one regiment.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_6"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
<p>The third layer was the village militia. The total number of both the regional troops and militias was not clear, because the archives are incomplete. Moreover, after sensing an impending purge, some units in the East Zone were upgraded beyond the standard allowance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_7"><sup>7</sup></xref> Only the total number of the troops under the nine divisions was clear. In sum, a shadow of this three-echelon force more or less perpetuated after 1979, albeit on a smaller scale.</p>

<title>The post-1979 reorganization: strategic and operational doctrine</title>
<p>January 1979. Originally designed as a guerrilla army, and was still primarily fighting as such, the Khmer Rouge was no match for the PAVN on the open battlefield. Many divisions were routed. Yet, as a guerrilla army, such routs were not a serious issue. After all, one simply could not rout an army that used to fight as guerilla units, where the best unit was the squad. Thus, the divisions that were routed in 1979 in the East Zone immediately reorganized themselves into a de facto, division-size, mechanized task force and began to fight a brutal retrograde operation to withdraw to the Cambodian-Thai border, some three hundred kilometers away.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But how did you get the tanks to move that far, considering the severe state you were in?&#x201D; the author asked, instinctively. &#x201C;We actually improvised along the way&#x201D; the commander replied as he struggled to remember a point that was almost overlooked.</p>
<p>As the PAVN&#x2019;s blitzkrieg spearhead surged forward toward Siem Reap province, the supply convoy struggled to keep up. The PAVN then met the Khmer Rouge task force at the head of the Tonle Sap Lake and the Khmer Rouge task force defeated the PAVN logistics guard in details. As a logistics element in a blitzkrieg war, the PAVN convoy contained both fuel and
<target target-type="page" id="page_51"/>ammunition for the tanks. These tanks were the same T-54, or T-55 used by both sides. The captured supplies were enough for the Khmer Rouge task force to fight one operation in its own right. The Khmer Rouge task force no longer remained a force fighting a retrograde operation, but a genuine threat to the PAVN rear.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh now I see, that was why my unit (a Khmer unit fighting alongside the PAVN) was ordered back from Pursat to the rear, to guard the supply routes at that time because we heard there was a major attack at the rear!&#x201D; exclaimed a former KPRA soldier, thus seemingly confirming the account of the former Khmer Rouge commander.</p>
<p>But the commander still knew there were some battles he should not contest. Instead of transitioning into attack, he continued the retrograde operation until the task force reached its objective in the safety of the Cardamom Mountains range in Pursat province. He lost all the tanks along the way due to mechanical problems, but almost all of the entire task force survived the ordeal. The task force then gave birth to three divisions that operated in the area until 1991. He spoke proudly of the operation. &#x201C;We were on par with the Vietnamese. They dealt us a blow, we dealt them a blow. A punch came, a punch was returned.&#x201D; As events would later show, the commander did not exaggerate. The Khmer Rouge had started their guerrilla campaign in earnest.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge divisions were very different from those of the other factions. They adhered to the &#x201C;People&#x2019;s War&#x201D; concept of war and cemented their military organization with the local population, either through selective intimidation or ideology or both. Thus, while the Khmer Rouge divisions might have had a substantially smaller number of troops than those of other factions, all of them were maneuver units, while logistics and sustainment support were conducted by the local civilian population, or the separate, all-female units. The units of the other factions would include support elements (logistics and sustainment) in their order of battle.</p>
<p>Officially, the Khmer Rouge army was known as the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK), a shadow of Democratic Kampuchea, which still held a seat at the UN. Yet, the soldiers in the field shied away from using this name, which was associated with the murderous period between 1975 and 1979. Surprisingly, this army functioned without official name or rank. Perhaps, their hatred of the Vietnamese transcended these basic ancillaries.</p>
<p>In the post-1979 reorganization, each NADK division had between three or four regiments but had no heavy (long-range) artillery. Each regiment had three or four battalions. Each battalion, however, controlled only two to three squads.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_8"><sup>8</sup></xref> Thus, each NADK battalion would have had only between 30 and 40 soldiers, each regiment between 70 and 80 soldiers, and each division between 300 and 400 soldiers. In other words, an NADK division functioned as an equivalent of a KPRA&#x2019;s augmented battalion. During the war, whenever the Khmer Rouge mobilized to attack a large objective, it
<target target-type="page" id="page_"/>almost never committed less than one division. The inflated organization gave the Khmer Rouge around forty nominal divisions, manned by only about thirty thousand troops.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_9"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>

<p>There were a few exceptions to this rule. Benefiting from the sanctuaries along the Cambodian-Thai border and the ability to retreat to Thailand in times of duress, most divisions that operated around the Khmer Rouge headquarters were full and heavy divisions. Four divisions were the most prominent. The 415th Division, operating around Route 10 near Pailin in Battambang province, and the 450th Division, operating in Malai, the border between Battambang and Banteay Meanchey, each had strength similar to that of a KPRA division.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_10"><sup>10</sup></xref> The 980th and 920th Divisions in Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey also had similar strength.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_11"><sup>11</sup></xref> None of them had tanks until late 1989, after which they captured a few from the KPRA in Pailin. In 1990, the Khmer Rouge also received a number of tanks from China.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_12"><sup>12</sup></xref> Nevertheless, there was no notable event during which they used tanks decisively. Pol Pot seemed to prefer holding them back to protect his headquarters.</p>
<p>At the strategic level, the Khmer Rouge adopted a &#x201C;rusty iron&#x201D; concept, which was protracted guerrilla warfare to wear down the enemy by attrition, and then defeat the enemy on the conventional battlefield.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_13"><sup>13</sup></xref> This strategy should come as no surprise, since it had been applied with success against the Khmer Republic in the 1970s. In line with this strategy, at the operational level, the NADK&#x2019;s concept was almost an exact copy of the People&#x2019;s War playbook. In a rare display of self-confidence, the NADK Bulletin briefly revealed the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s operational concept, which consisted of five successive steps. In the &#x201C;five-target combat tactics,&#x201D; the NADK sought to detect the weakest &#x201C;Vietnamese hamlets&#x201D; (in the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s parlance, this was the PRK-controlled hamlet), carrying out repeated attacks, carrying
<target target-type="page" id="page_53"/>out mobile attacks, transforming the &#x201C;Vietnamese temporarily controlled areas&#x201D; into active guerrilla zones, and then turning these into guerrilla bases.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_14"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
<p>In this Khmer Rouge concept, the ultimate objective was not one of attrition on the PRK&#x2019;s manpower, nor was it merely interested in the body count of its enemy. On the contrary, controlling the hamlet and village administration was the key to success in the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s greater scheme of things. Once it gained control of these hamlets and villages, however temporary, propaganda efforts and civic actions were then carried out to try to eliminate the influence of the PRK&#x2019;s local administration and its link with the local people. In addition to the five-target combat tactic, the NADK taught the people in the locales that it had occupied the &#x201C;3 don&#x2019;ts&#x201D; movement that the people must adhere to: don&#x2019;t sell the supplies (rice, fish, and other com modities) to the Yuon enemy (derogatory term for Vietnamese); don&#x2019;t allow the Yuon enemy&#x2019;s recruitment for the K-5 plan (cf. <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter4">Chapter 4</xref>); and don&#x2019;t allow the forced recruitment of soldiers by the Yuon enemy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_15"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
<p>To achieve these political goals and strategic objectives, the Khmer Rouge needed a capable army. Military-wise, the Khmer Rouge then divided their areas of operation into three &#x201C;battle zones&#x201D; (see Map 3.1): the first area in the surrounds of the Tonle Sap Lake (because of its economic potential), the second area along the Cambodian-Thai border (due to its infiltration potential), and the third area covered the rest of the country (to fix the KPRA forces).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_16"><sup>16</sup></xref> This strategic concept was not merely declaratory. The NADK actually allocated forces to fight in the three areas in accordance to the respective importance. As a result, Battle Zone 1 and 2 received the most forces while Battle Zone 3 did not have any major formation operating under its responsibility.</p>
<p>In the northwestern provinces, the NADK&#x2019;s formation reached the level of &#x201C;Front&#x201D; (which is an equivalent to &#x201C;corps&#x201D; in the organization of Western countries). The NADK organized two Fronts, Front 909, which operated in the Battambang-Pursat border, and Front 250, which operated south of Sisophon (provincial capital of Banteay Meanchey), i.e. along the border between Battambang and Banteay Meanchey provinces.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_17"><sup>17</sup></xref> These organizations were mainly used for command and control. The Khmer Rouge still lacked the capability of being able to mass and fight as a conventional army in the early years of the war.</p>
<p>Front 909 oversaw the operations of nine divisions, three of which were created from the former 502nd and 5th Divisions of Democratic Kampuchea. Front 250 controlled four heavy divisions and four special (augmented) regiments. By Cambodian standards, therefore, both were corps-size formations.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_18"><sup>18</sup></xref> In addition, the Khmer Rouge did not rely solely on refugee camps for sanctuaries or manpower. Unlike the non-communist resistance, which we will examine next, the Khmer Rouge relied more on their underground networks in the villages all over the country. It was such an expansive network that allowed the NADK to operate in all of
<target target-type="page" id="page_54"/>the battlefields and battle zones. In terms of mat&#x00E9;riels, the NADK was generously supplied by China.</p>

<label>Map 3.1</label>

<graphic xlink:href="fig3_1.png" mime-subtype="png"/>

</fig>

<p>At the operational level, the NADK also deployed its forces to specific &#x201C;Battlefields,&#x201D; which corresponded to the terrain with special local significance. These were the prioritized areas within a Battle Zone. For example, &#x201C;Southern Sisophon Battlefield&#x201D; lay at the border between Battambang and Banteay Meanchey province. Operating along the border between two provinces was a favorite Khmer Rouge tactic because any KPRA operation would have to be a coordinated operation between the two provinces. Such operations are, by nature, complicated and prone to failure due to the possibility for misunderstanding by both commands. Controlling this Battlefield would also allow the NADK to cut a stretch of National Road 5 to isolate Sisophon. The Southern Sisophon Battlefield was in the area of operations of Front 250.</p>
<p>Once again, just like the low priority of Battle Zone 3, the area to the east had only a few aggregated Battlefields and these were not supported by any major formation apart from several small divisions. This reinforces the point that Battle Zone 3 was a fixing force and was not a priority in the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s larger scheme. One major reason for this had something to do with logistics. As we talk about Fronts, operating in major battlefields and battle zones like this, logistics become very demanding. This is an area we will examine next.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_55"/>Logistics</title>
<p>No research has ever been undertaken in regard to the transportation and logistics units. Written archives are also very rare. The best sources of information that this book draws upon are the intelligence reports by the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s enemy, the KPRA, and information from the NADK bi-monthly bulletin.</p>
<p>Logistics in this war is not something that one can observe in wars like World War II, where the United States and Soviet militaries lined up endless convoys of trucks to bring the mat&#x00E9;riels, fuel, and ammunition to the fighting units at the frontline. The war in Cambodia was an impoverished war where logistics were conducted by people, literally.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge continued its military tradition of the 1970s by using female warriors in the transportation units. The NADK bulletin fully grasped the importance of the logistics units and dedicated half of its very first issue to photos describing the heroism of the all-female transportation units.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_19"><sup>19</sup></xref> The same dedication can be observed throughout subsequent issues.</p>
<p>The number of personnel in the transportation unit varied from unit to unit. Every unit included local people in its ranks to guide the path. In the NADK bulletin, in most photos of the transportation units, one can often discern a few females in civilian uniforms travelling with the NADK transporters who, in turn, sported olive green battle fatigues, courtesy of China&#x2019;s People&#x2019;s Liberation Army.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_20"><sup>20</sup></xref> In all of the pictorial evidence related to the transportation units, none of them ever carried ammunition for small arms. The transporters always carried rocket-propelled grenade rounds, recoilless rifle rounds, and artillery rounds, especially the 107mm rockets, which could be used as a terror weapon when fired on urban centers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_21"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
<p>The NADK was committed to operate deep inside Cambodia to disabuse any notion that the PRK had staying power. To extend its operational reach, the NADK relied heavily upon hidden ammunition caches that would need to be hoarded in advance. This method had both advantages and disadvantages. The major advantage of this logistical concept was that it allowed the NADK to operate anywhere in Cambodia and with significant intensity. Also, because it was a hidden cache, the NADK would not have to worry about interdiction of supply columns by the enemy. The war then shifted to the intelligence arena where the &#x201C;people-informants&#x201D; were crucial for both the Khmer Rouge (keeping secrets) and the PRK (convincing the people to uncover the cache). With expansive networks in villages across the country, the Khmer Rouge did not find it difficult to keep the cache hidden until the time of attack.</p>
<p>The major disadvantage, however, was how to get the ammunitions from the Cambodian-Thai border to the particular cache near the site of attack in the first place. This was where the NADK&#x2019;s supply column could not entirely avoid the enemy&#x2019;s interdiction. Before the start of the dry and rainy seasons, the NADK would launch a series of small offensive operations to
<target target-type="page" id="page_56"/>secure the paths that the logistics units needed to transport ammunition to the interior. Some of those operations could be sustained for months.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_22"><sup>22</sup></xref> After the paths were secured and the ammunition transported, the NADK would then shift attention towards targets inside the country. Whether or not the PRK could stop such attacks depended largely on whether it could stop the supply of arms from the border. As a result, the fiercest battles were not the ones carried out in the villages or districts, but they were the PRK&#x2019;s interdiction of the NADK&#x2019;s supply columns. The success of such operations, in turn, depended on the political battles waged in the villages and districts.</p>
<p>The second major disadvantage of this logistics concept was the tyranny of distance. The further the NADK needed to transport the ammunition, the more ammunition it had to consume in the operations to open the paths for the transportation units. It was precisely because of this inherent problem that the NADK could not significantly extend its operational reach into Battle Zone 3. In turn, the zone was used only as a fixing force, attacking just to keep the KPRA busy, denying it reinforcement to the northwestern part of the country.</p>
<p>In summary, the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s strategic and operational concepts were born out of the stark realities of the Cambodian battlefield. With limited ammunition, as one travelled farther into Cambodia, the NADK had to be very creative as to how it could best use this ammunition. Consequently, most NADK attacks were to undermine the PRK&#x2019;s control of the countryside, although it was not able to hold any target for long in the face of the PRK&#x2019;s counterattack. Limited ammunition basically dictated the tactics.</p>
<p>Accordingly, to make the best of this situation, each NADK attack on a village or district was followed by political action such as the organization of a political march or demonstrations by the local people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_23"><sup>23</sup></xref> The people carried placards and signs protesting against the &#x201C;Vietnamese aggression&#x201D; all the while supporting the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s &#x201C;peaceful policy&#x201D; and then making offers for negotiation. Sometimes, the event specifically supported a certain political proposal such as the 8-point peace plan of the CGDK in 1986.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_24"><sup>24</sup></xref> When the KPRA&#x2019;s counterattacking elements arrived in the village, they would find only a dazed populace with the Khmer Rouge soldiers long gone, leaving behind their underground networks. The KPRA units described the people as &#x201C;two-faced,&#x201D; supporting whatever winning side came into the village. &#x201C;But we understand, they had to do that in order to survive,&#x201D; one KPRA officer noted.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_25"><sup>25</sup></xref></p>

<title>Tactics: military and political concept of guerrilla war</title>
<p>The scourge of ideology, the Khmer Rouge soldiers were dreaded by everyone, and rightly so. One KPRA officer of the 4th Division noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>You don&#x2019;t know the effects of ideology until you were in a tank and saw one of the Khmer Rouge fighters running towards you and carrying
<target target-type="page" id="page_57"/>an anti-tank mine on his chest. You then fired on him, only to have two other fighters pop up, picking up the mine and continuing running towards you.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_26"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One can always sense fear and uneasiness when former soldiers (from any faction) talked about the Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>As the Khmer Rouge endeavored to fight the war as a People&#x2019;s War, the NADK&#x2019;s tactical doctrine was accordingly based on the guerrilla concept of operation. Former KPRA soldiers spoke of their fear of Khmer Rouge ambushes and anti-infantry tactics.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_27"><sup>27</sup></xref> Major roads were almost always ambushed. Small NADK squads relied on generous use of rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), which were devastating against infantry, vehicles, and lightly armored units. Sometimes, the Khmer Rouge used recoilless rifles to destroy heavy vehicles. They also used anti-personnel and anti-tank mines in conjunction with improvised booby traps, which included even the primitive bamboo-stick pits.</p>
<p>According to a former KPRA officer in Battambang, the Khmer Rouge had an undying love for ambush. Even when their position was destroyed by a KPRA surprise attack, they still prepared ambush positions to counterattack as the KPRA left the scene. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know what they did, but whatever they did there was always an ambush, even when they had only a few people left,&#x201D; former KPRA soldiers noted in their official unit&#x2019;s history.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_28"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>
<p>Second, the Khmer Rouge sought to build a cohesive fighting unit. In all of their battles, the Khmer Rouge always fought to retrieve the bodies of their fallen comrades. In some cases, the attack to retrieve the bodies could even be more intense than the original attack itself, especially because the KPRA units did not expect such attacks.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_29"><sup>29</sup></xref> According to a former chief of staff of the KPRA&#x2019;s Kampong Thom provincial military command (PMC), the Khmer Rouge never left more than five bodies on the battlefield unless they completely exhausted their resources to recover them.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_30"><sup>30</sup></xref> In fact, this tradition had been observed since the time they fought as guerrilla units in the 1970s. For the Khmer Rouge soldiers, their cause was not material gains, but ideology. A former non-communist resistance officer duly noted: &#x201C;the Khmer Rouge did not eat rice, they ate ideology.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_31"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>
<p>Political actions in the military units were also sustained on a regular basis. For underground units that operated far away from headquarters, and had no regular contact with these headquarters, loyalty was naturally a problem. To ensure loyalty in hard times, the Khmer Rouge leaders organized regular political sessions called &#x201C;spiritual enhancement sessions.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_32"><sup>32</sup></xref> Divisional com manders and regimental commanders attended these sessions on a regular basis. Pol Pot and senior leaders such as Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, and Ieng Sary were the instructors and typically gave classes from Pol Pot&#x2019;s home in Trat Province (Thailand) opposite the Cambodian province of Pursat.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_33"><sup>33</sup></xref> The classes involved political theories, the study of &#x201C;contradictions,&#x201D; and international
<target target-type="page" id="page_58"/>situations. The sessions were also used for conflict resolution and adjudication, in which Pol Pot was renowned to be professionally skilled.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_34"><sup>34</sup></xref></p>

<title>&#x201C;What have we to lose?&#x201D;: life of an ordinary Cambodian amid chaos</title>
<p>If one talks about the Russian Revolution of 1917, the word &#x201C;Bolshevik&#x201D; tends to come to mind. The February Revolution was a foreign concept and the name Alexander Kerensky unheard of. The keys to this different level of understanding seemed to be the better organization and ruthlessness of the Bolsheviks, which propelled them to success, thus guaranteeing themselves a place in the history books.</p>
<p>It was no different for the four factions in the Cambodian conflict. One could count no less than a hundred movements that claimed to fight against the Vietnamese in the beginning of 1979.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_35"><sup>35</sup></xref> Before the establishment of the FUNCINPEC, the KPNLF, Democratic Kampuchea, and People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), everyone was fighting against everyone. Nevertheless, how these groups came into being and how they evolved into the bigger movements has not received sufficient scholarly attention.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter, the previously untold stories of the origins of the PRK were narrated, whose political and armed movement was conceived in the Vietnamese province of Long Giao. No Western sources have ever shed light on this story. Even the Khmer Rouge soldiers themselves had seen their histories ignored. Many were more interested in the genocide issue than the military history of the Khmer Rouge. At the beginning of this chapter, we have already seen how one Khmer Rouge commander struggled to survive under the weight of the Vietnamese blitzkrieg.</p>
<p>But in comparison, they were still better off compared to other smaller groups. The Long Giao battalions and the Khmer Rouge were big move ments and possessed enough armaments to fight a small war on their own. But the same could not be said of other groups that eventually formed the FUNCINPEC and KPNLF. Stories of the lives of the combatants of various other groups have been largely undocumented, and their life stories have almost entered oblivion. These loose groups of armed fighters refused to submit to the Khmer Rouge in 1975 and did not join the PRK in 1979 despite their hatred of the Khmer Rouge. To them, the situation was akin to a Khmer aphorism: either meeting the crocodile in the water or encountering the tiger when emerging from the water.</p>
<p>To narrate all of these stories is not the purpose of this book. Never theless, this section is dedicated to the story of an unaffiliated combatant (by 1979) whose life, in the author&#x2019;s judgment, is largely representative of the challenges faced by his contemporaries. The story presented here came exclusively from oral accounts.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_59"/>The year 1975 was not really the year that the Khmer Rouge controlled all of Cambodia. Some refused to submit to the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge was adept at lying to people that they wanted to kill only so as to minimize resistance. However, it should be noted that not everyone believed the Khmer Rouge in 1975. Some of the former Khmer Republic went into hiding in the closest jungle area as soon as the country fell to the Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge called these men &#x201C;bandits&#x201D; because they usually came out in small groups to attack Khmer Rouge patrols, break people out of prisons, and persuade the laborers to join them. For lack of a better term, we shall call them the &#x201C;so-called bandits.&#x201D; Accounts of the so-called bandits could be verified with survivors in many areas all over Cambodia. These so-called bandits operated deep inside Cambodia and used the jungle as their stronghold.</p>
<p>One group of the so-called bandits also operated along the Cambodian-Thai border in the Northwest. This group consisted of the local people and the former Khmer Republic soldiers who could simply run into Thai territory when Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge. While the Thai authorities were aware of the existence of these armed men who resisted against the Khmer Rouge, Thailand did not seem to have a consistent policy toward these groups. For some, it is claimed that the Thai authorities deceived, arrested, and killed many members of the group.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_36"><sup>36</sup></xref> Others, however, claimed that Thailand used these so-called bandits purely for instrumental reasons. Some were used as scouts to deal with the Red Thai and some, after the Vietnamese intervention in 1979, were employed as advance parties to guide the way for the Thai army in dealing with the waves of refugees from Cambodia.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_37"><sup>37</sup></xref> Regardless of what they did, the majority would later constitute the core cadres of the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC.</p>
<p>The story of a former FUNCINPEC regimental commander of the 2nd Division is enlightening. CT (his initials) was one of the &#x201C;new people&#x201D; under the Khmer Rouge (meaning his loyalty to the revolution could not be ascertained). Because he lived in Banteay Chhmar district located near the Cambodian-Thai border, his escape was possible and it was swift. In 1976, he escaped to Thailand where he met Im Chhoudeth, the former Cambodian ambassador to Thailand in 1975, and who stayed there after the Khmer Rouge came to power. Im Chhoudeth would later become a founding member of the KPNLF&#x2019;s executive committee. CT was assigned to a Cambodian guerrilla unit consisting of 160 soldiers. The group&#x2019;s task was primarily to interdict the movement of the Red Thais due to the group&#x2019;s familiarity with jungle in the area. The Red Thais had no chance. In 1977, the last contingent of 60 Red Thais operating in that area surrendered to the Thai authorities.</p>
<p>To the Thai authorities, it seemed that CT&#x2019;s group had outlived its usefulness. According to CT, his unit was then given a new task. The unit was to operate, this time, deep inside Cambodia. When pressed for details on the main operational objectives, CT seemed unable to remember anything.
<target target-type="page" id="page_60"/>It turned out there was no real objective, or at least none that was feasible. To say that &#x201C;you go deep into Cambodia and organize an anti-Khmer Rouge resistance group&#x201D; was not a feasible military objective, given the small size of CT&#x2019;s group, and given the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s strength at the time. Frankly, it looked more like a suicide mission.</p>
<p>An examination of the logistical arrangements is even more illuminating. Each fighter was given a ration of fifty-two cans of rice, five kilograms of salt, and some medicine with boxes that were devoid of anything that could be traced back to Thailand. Each would carry only a rifle and some ammunition, barely enough for five minutes of firefight. The objective was political (i.e. organize an anti-Khmer Rouge resistance group), but the fighters carried nothing to that effect (propaganda). The unlikely objective, plus the unrealistic logistics, could only make one wonder, did the Thai authorities send CT&#x2019;s group on a suicide mission, hoping that the Khmer Rouge soldiers would do the dirty work for them? After all, the Thai authorities had no clear policy regarding Cambodia and did not have any sympathy with groups like this. Sending CT&#x2019;s group back into Cambodia to meet its end was probably the most efficient way to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>But as the saying goes in Cambodia, if it&#x2019;s not your time, then it&#x2019;s not your time. CT managed to stay hidden and survived in Banteay Srey district in Siem Reap province until the Vietnamese arrived in 1979. In the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge collapse, CT returned to his hometown in Banteay Chhmar district and was elected as a chairman of the people&#x2019;s revolutionary committee (i.e. village chief). But then his old contact reached out to him and proselytized him with gifts of rice, which was a very precious commodity at the time. First, he went to meet Im Chhoudeth, but returned to his village afterwards. In 1981, he went back again for good. This time, he met Ton Chay, the leader of a movement known as <italic>Kleing Moeung</italic>, the namesake of a Cambodian historical hero in the fifteenth century. In the ensuing years, the group would be transformed into the 2nd Division of the <italic>Arm&#x00E9;e National Sihanoukhiste</italic> (ANS). CT, by virtue of his early arrival to the movement, rose through the ranks to become a regimental commander of the 2nd Division.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 16-Camps Campaign by the PAVN in 1985 (see sections below), the ANS was dispersed and reorganized itself into three ad hoc task forces. CT led a two thousand-man strong task force dubbed Angkor Chey II tasked with opening ways behind the PAVN line for the surviving ANS forces (organized into Angkor Chey I and III) to disperse into the Tonle Sap lake area. In the operation after the Vietnamese withdrew in 1989, CT was the one who suggested to Ton Chay to use money instead of a frontal assault to defeat the 7th Regiment of the KPRA&#x2019;s 286th Division at Kauk Morn village, Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey province.</p>
<p>That was the only instance where the 286th Division, which was a heavy mechanized division, lost a regiment during the whole war. CT&#x2019;s brief trip to that place actually saved him from the debacle at Phnom Srok (see
<target target-type="page" id="page_61"/><xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter5">Chapter 5</xref>). CT would later be involved in many high-profile events until the very end of the war and complete peace in 1999. In retirement, CT chose to follow the path of Buddha and became a monk&#x2019;s butler in a pagoda in Banteay Meanchey. The irony for CT is that he had to fight constantly to survive. The alternative to not fighting was certain death. As Samuel Griffith bluntly put it, &#x201C; &#x2018;What do we have to lose?&#x2019; Once a great many people ask themselves this question, a revolutionary situation is incipient.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_38"><sup>38</sup></xref> Many Cambodians living and fighting along the Cambodian-Thai border at the time asked themselves exactly that question.</p>

<title>Revenge of the Khmer Republic</title>
<p>Also fighting against the Vietnamese and the PRK was a collection of armed groups that were organized in 1979 and controlled the refugee camps that straddled the Cambodia-Thai border. These small bands of fighters were either remnants of the Khmer Republic army or former royalists who continued to fight even after the fall of Phnom Penh in 1975. In 1979, as refugees fled to the border, many of these groups became involved in black marketeering, smuggling, as well as preying on the helpless refugees. Many of their leaders were known by the infamous prefix &#x201C;warlords.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_39"><sup>39</sup></xref></p>
<p>Eventually, they gravitated towards two major movements. Thailand sought to organize a resistance group to curb the Vietnamese advance, and Prince Sihanouk also looked to organize his own movement so that he would not have to rely on the Khmer Rouge. The Royal Thai Army spearheaded the establishment of the Khmer People&#x2019;s National Liberation Front (KPNLF) and, in conjunction with the United States&#x2019; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Thai Army organized a military unit called Task Force 838 to advise and train its army.</p>
<p>Thailand&#x2019;s involvements in Cambodian affairs seemed to be an afterthought. As the first PAVN units crossed the Cambodian-Vietnamese border on 25 December 1978, the age-old domino theory became fashionable once more for Thailand. Thus, the ambiguity of policy towards the armed resistance movement in Cambodia disappeared. Thailand began to adopt an active Cambodian policy in earnest.</p>
<p>At roughly the same time that the Khmer Rouge units were fighting retrograde operations to withdraw to the Cambodian-Thai border, Thailand sent an army colonel, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on a special mission to France. Colonel Chavalit would soon climb the ranks to become a powerful Royal Thai Army commander and was later elected as premier of Thailand in the 1990s. With contacts like the former ambassador of the Khmer Republic to Thailand, Im Chhoudeth, it was not difficult for Thailand to gather together the old veterans of the Khmer Republic army to lead a resistance
<target target-type="page" id="page_62"/>movement. Gathering these veterans was the special mission that colonel Chavalit carried out in France. His first and major mark was the retired brigadier general of the Khmer Republic army, General Dien Del. Dien Del was generally viewed as a disciplined, capable, and composed commander. His integrity was assured and his hatred for communism, particularly the Khmer Rouge, unmatched.</p>
<p>In the old days of the Khmer Republic, one of the most notable events was a campaign the Khmer Republic army carried out in 1971 called Operation Chenla II. The plan called for a general offensive along the stretch of National Road 6 linking Kampong Cham province and Kampong Thom province, and also defending that road from the PAVN hiding in the nearby rubber plantations. Major Dien Del was among the dissenting voices who counselled against the plan because it was militarily indefensible: deploying one single line of defense along the one-hundred kilometer road. As part of the minority opinion, his advice went unheeded and he was sent to a staff course in Saigon.</p>
<p>On 1 December 1971, the PAVN&#x2019;s 9th Division perforated the fragile line at several places, and encircled and destroyed the formation of the Khmer Republic army. One could be so bold as to claim that because Dien Del&#x2019;s opinion was dismissed, the Khmer Republic army lost ten battalions in a single night, a loss from which they never recovered.</p>
<p>Until 1975, Dien Del maintained his fight against the Khmer Rouge, even though some of his comrades actually sold war mat&#x00E9;riels to the Khmer Rouge for personal gain at the expense of the republic. After the fall of Phnom Penh, Dien Del went to the United States and then France, participating in various associations of Cambodia abroad.</p>
<p>When Colonel Chavalit came to France to recruit former officers to lead a resistance movement, he did not need to ask twice. On 5 March 1979, an armed group, the Khmer People&#x2019;s National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF) was proclaimed with Dien Del as commander. In fact, the KPNLAF was not a monolithic movement, but an amalgamation of smaller movements operating along the Cambodian-Thai border following the fall of Phnom Penh in 1975. Perhaps with Thailand as the patron, the KPNLAF could attract almost all of those smaller movements. Some, however, refused to join the KPNLAF (such as the MOULKINAKA group, cf. next section) and some groups splintered (like the Klaing Moeung movement). The existence of these residual forces opened the way for Prince Sihanouk to organize his own movement. This section will explain the origin of the KPNLAF, while Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s movement will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<title>Organization</title>
<p>Before and immediately after 1979, Thailand did not really have any clear policy towards the plight of refugees in Cambodia, or those running away
<target target-type="page" id="page_63"/>from, or fighting against, the Khmer Rouge. In some cases, the refugees who marched to the border in the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge collapse in January 1979 were forced to march back into Cambodia across minefields and malaria-infested jungle. It was only after the arrival of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) at the border, and the creation of an ad hoc unit, the United Nations Border Relief Operation (UNBRO) that Thailand began to accept the settlement of refugees along the Cambodian-Thai border. The establishment of the KPNLAF reinforced this policy because Thailand immediately saw the benefit of having refugee camps along the border as they could help increase the KPNLAF&#x2019;s manpower.</p>
<p>By this time, Thailand seemed to have found a perfect plan to stop the Vietnamese expansion in Southeast Asia, and Thailand also seemed to have found in General Dien Del a man who was loyal to a cause, and who was also a capable commander. But one can never be too careful. In case General Dien Del wanted to become a military dictator or act in any way that contravened Thailand&#x2019;s interests, he would be checked by the political apparatus (KPNLF), and vice versa. In other words, the KPNLF and the KPNLAF were supposed to counterbalance each other to keep the movement in check and to make sure the movement could not do anything that was harmful to Thai interests. As one former official of the KPNLF recounted, the Thai civilian government and the ministry of foreign affairs tended to support the political faction while the Thai military tended to support the military faction.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_40"><sup>40</sup></xref></p>
<p>On 9 October 1979, about seven months after the creation of a unified armed group, the political body was established, called the Khmer People&#x2019;s National Liberation Front (KPNLF). The KPNLF was organized as an anticommunist and anti-Vietnamese political resistance movement. The KPNLF was to be led by a committee called the Executive Committee (EXCO) or, as the Francophone leaders in the groups always liked to call, the <italic>Comit&#x00E9; Ex&#x00E9;cutif</italic> (COMEX). The EXCO was composed of twelve members (called &#x201C;delegates&#x201D;), each in charge of specific areas such as military, economic, cultural, foreign affairs, etc.</p>
<p>Over time, prominent figures of the <italic>ancient r&#x00E9;gime</italic> started to emerge at the border, although certainly not without Thailand&#x2019;s blessing. Another military commander who arrived at the border was General Sak Suthsakhan who was chief of the general staffs in the 1970s as well as President of the Khmer Republic in the dying days of the republic. He played the role of symbolic commander of the KPNLAF while General Dien Del (General Sak&#x2019;s former subordinate) was chief of the general staff. The leader of the KPNLF was Son Sann, a former prime minister under Prince Sihanouk in the 1960s. As someone who was not involved in the coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat against Prince Sihanouk in 1970, Son Sann was thought to be more amenable to working with Prince Sihanouk and was someone Prince Sihanouk could accept in joining the fight against the Vietnamese.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_64"/>While Son Sann was president of the movement, in the complicated, or rather obscured, organization of the EXCO he was only a delegate. Perhaps he was the <italic>primus inter pares</italic> delegate (Latin for &#x201C;first among equals&#x201D;), but a delegate nonetheless. It seemed Thailand was being careful not to make this movement too unified and too strong. But that was the cause of all the troubles to follow. Later, while Son Sann thought he was the president of the movement, thus entitled to some prerogatives, others such as General Dien Del thought that no man was above the EXCO. But in 1979, that was a moot issue.</p>
<p>The KPNLAF started to build its ranks under General Dien Del. A professional soldier by trade, General Dien Del was preoccupied with building a force that could stand against the PAVN. His motto was &#x201C;organization, organization, organization and training, training, training.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_41"><sup>41</sup></xref> The KPNLAF boasted the organization of a formal officer school in the jungle. The officer school called &#x201C;sala youthin&#x201D; (French: <italic>Ecole d&#x2019;Officier Actif</italic> or EOA) produced the first batch of officers, called the <italic>El&#x00E8;ves Officer Actifs</italic>, in 1981. The cadets had to go through a six-month basic military training and another three months of specialized training in the different branches of the army such as infantry, intelligence, combat engineer, transportation, communication, cavalry, and heavy weapons. Interviews with former students revealed that most specialized trainings were done &#x201C;theoretically&#x201D; without actual practice or live fire exercise due to the lack of war mat&#x00E9;riels.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_42"><sup>42</sup></xref> Regardless, the training and the existence of the school itself were great feats, given the conditions the KPNLAF found itself in at the time.</p>
<p>The training attempted to instill in each combatant the spirit of guerrilla tactical doctrine. As a former officer put it, the motto of the KPNLAF&#x2019;s tactical doctrine was &#x201C;Look, listen, don&#x2019;t speak, reflect, adapt, and only then be &#x2018;adopted&#x2019; as a combatant of the KPNLAF.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_43"><sup>43</sup></xref> Upon completion of the training, cadets would earn the rank of sub-lieutenant, part of the resurrection of the system that prevailed under the <italic>ancient r&#x00E9;gime</italic>. According to some estimates, the EOA produced a total of seven batches of officers at the Ampil base.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_44"><sup>44</sup></xref> After the base was overrun by the PAVN in 1985, the KPNLAF moved inside Thailand and the EOA continued to produce between three and four more batches of officers.</p>
<p>In all, the school produced around one thousand officers who went on to serve in various KPNLAF combat units and the KPNLAF General Staff Headquarters. Some senior officers went on to receive further study and train ing in various places such as the high command course in Thailand, Malaysian guerrilla training camps, training camps in Thailand run by the elite British commando unit, the Special Air Service (SAS), and anti-tank weapon training inside Cambodia by officers from various ASEAN coun tries.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_45"><sup>45</sup></xref> The KPNLAF also boasted a Political Warfare School. In January 1984, President Son Sann presided over a ceremony to kick off the fifth batch of officer training course as well as the 27th training of political warfare students.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_46"><sup>46</sup></xref></p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_65"/>Thailand&#x2019;s check-and-balance policy bites its tail: KPNLF&#x2019;s internal rift</title>
<p>All military resistance groups need some sort of political apparatus able to produce ideology to help maintain the integrity of the rank-and-file, and to recruit more people to the movement. From the standpoint of the Thai authorities, or any sponsor for that matter, a political organization could also check and balance the military organization and prevent a military despot unable to be controlled. Another way the sponsors controlled the resistance movement was through the distribution of weapons, food, and medicine, or limitation thereof.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_47"><sup>47</sup></xref></p>
<p>The KPNLF was controlled by the EXCO. General Dien Del, in par ticular, recalled that he did not really like such a system: &#x201C;you can&#x2019;t control military activities through a committee.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_48"><sup>48</sup></xref> But as a military officer, and probably due in no small part to the sponsors&#x2019; pressure, Dien Del had to yield to the collective political decision and he held the position of &#x201C;Delegate for Military Affairs&#x201D; in the EXCO.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_49"><sup>49</sup></xref> Son Sann held the position of President of the KPNLF.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, it increasingly appeared that the sponsors had mulled over the possibility of unifying all of the resistance movements under the political umbrella of Democratic Kampuchea (the Khmer Rouge) due to the fact that this government was the de jure government of Cambodia, having held the seat at the United Nations. Accordingly, framing the war as a struggle between this government and Vietnam was the same as branding the Vietnamese as an aggressor as well as pointing to the Vietnamese-backed government (People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea) as an illegitimate, puppet government.</p>
<p>The only question was who was going to lead such a unified movement. Surely, most of the KPNLF who were remnants of the Khmer Republic did not like the Khmer Rouge, neither did Prince Sihanouk who was deceived and imprisoned by the Khmer Rouge. But Prince Sihanouk also did not like the KPNLF, because most of them were part of the conspiracy that deposed him in 1970. The feeling was mutual for many people in the KPNLF. In other words, all three resistance movements did not really see eye to eye with each other.</p>
<p>Soon, an idea was floated that the unified movement would not be an amalgamation of the smaller movements, but instead would function like a confederation in which the constituting movements still held power and identity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_50"><sup>50</sup></xref> Logically, this meant that there could be two major movements, the communist Khmer Rouge and a non-communist movement, probably the KPNLF with Son Sann as president. But then, it was impossible to ignore the elephant in the room: Prince Sihanouk. Still immensely popular among the Cambodian populace, Prince Sihanouk simply could not be excluded from Cambodian politics.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_66"/>According to one of Son Sann&#x2019;s confidants, in a secret meeting between Deng Xiao Ping and Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew, it was agreed that Prince Sihanouk could play an important role in the non-communist faction, information to which Son Sann was not given access.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_51"><sup>51</sup></xref> According to this account, Son Sann still maintained the hope that he would be accepted by the sponsoring countries, as well as the KPNLF, as the counterweight to the Khmer Rouge in a unified, anti-Vietnamese grand coalition. For one, Son Sann was not part of the conspiracy that deposed Prince Sihanouk in 1970, so he himself thought he could lead a movement with Prince Sihanouk playing the role of symbolic figurehead or even simply as a deputy to him.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_52"><sup>52</sup></xref> Such a proposition was quite risky and would require that the KPNLF speak with one voice. To some people in the KPNLF, as soon as there was news of a possibility of joining a grand coalition, President Son Sann became increasingly authoritative and arbitrary.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_53"><sup>53</sup></xref></p>
<p>Predictably, the unclear mandate of the office of the President of the KPNLF started to affect the unity of the movement, and a tense undercurrent started to surface. According to a former officer of the KPNLAF, in many meetings with the other EXCO delegates, camp administrators, and the people, Son Sann always said that the KPNLF had reached a crossroad and must make a turn.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_54"><sup>54</sup></xref> He asked them to grant him full power to decide on the future of the movement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_55"><sup>55</sup></xref> But this did not sit well with General Dien Del. It seems that Son Sann viewed his position as one of overarching authority, while General Dien Del viewed the President as the <italic>primus inter pares</italic> (first among equals) delegate but a delegate nevertheless.</p>
<p>As the KPNLF was deliberating on whether or not to join the antiVietnamese grand coalition, President Son Sann asked the EXCO to grant him full power as the one and only representative of the KPNLF in the grand coalition. General Dien Del saw that as an attempt to shut down the EXCO, the collective decision-making body of the KPNLF. He was the only voice that counselled against the full power of the president and reminded the meeting that EXCO was the only institution with the authority to guide the KPNLF.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_56"><sup>56</sup></xref> According to a former high-ranking officer of the KPNLAF, a public exchange ensued and after General Dien Del warned against the usurpation of democratic principles, the General, in military uniform and accompanied by an unarmed soldier, walked out of the meeting in protest.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_57"><sup>57</sup></xref> After that, the rift never healed until the end of the war.</p>
<p>In front of his house at the KPNLAF&#x2019;s headquarter at Banteay Ampil, General Dien Del put up an altar decorated with a can of incense sticks with a sign in Khmer and French that could be translated as &#x201C;Death of the EXCO.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_58"><sup>58</sup></xref> A ritual was usually performed, in Khmer tradition, to commemorate and pay homage to one&#x2019;s forbears. In this case, General Dien Del considered the day Son Sann asked for full power as the day the EXCO died. Son Sann began to gather his loyalists around him, and so did the military faction.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_59"><sup>59</sup></xref> Those who did not support Son Sann began to refer to
<target target-type="page" id="page_67"/>him as &#x201C;L&#x2019;Empereur&#x201D; (The Emperor) when they talked about Son Sann behind his back.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_60"><sup>60</sup></xref></p>
<p>Up until 1982, the KPNLF was functioning somewhat normally despite the rift, which was an amazing feat. It seems that the anti-Vietnamese sentiments transcended even the rift within the movement. But the rift between the Son Sann loyalists and the Dien Del/Sak Sutsakhan loyalists was never resolved until the end of the war. Task Force 838 and the CIA were usually the mediators between the two factions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_61"><sup>61</sup></xref> But sometimes, &#x201C;functioning somewhat normally&#x201D; is not enough to win a war, for according to the Prussian war theorist, Carl von Clausewitz, successful war is one where there are feasible political objectives. Without a symbiotic relationship between war and policy, one risks carrying out military operations that do not promise political gains. Such was the case of the KPNLAF&#x2019;s war plan of 1982, which we shall discuss in sections below.</p>

<title>Non-communist resistance 2: Samdech Oeuv&#x2019;s (king father&#x2019;s) army</title>
<p>The second non-communist movement was Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s FUNCINPEC. The organization of its armed wing, the <italic>Arm&#x00E9;e Nationale Sihanoukhiste</italic> (ANS), paralleled the KPNLAF in many ways. The majority of its forces were raised from the border camps, and the organization of the military regions of both sides also paralleled each other. Just like the KPNLAF, the ANS was born out of several armed groups that controlled the camps along the Cambodian-Thai border. As we have seen in the previous section, many small movements joined together and formed the KPNLF, mainly because this movement had Thailand as a sponsor, which made it easier to recruit soldiers.</p>
<p>Prince Sihanouk, on the other hand, had always been a maverick politician. Not a lot of people liked him, not because he was bad or incapable, but on the contrary. Anyone who supported Prince Sihanouk had better know that the Prince would not willingly do their bidding. The Khmer Rouge had to deceive the Prince and intimidate him at the same time. This did not come without any cost, however. After Prince Sihanouk made a speech condemning the Vietnamese in 1979, thus maintaining the legitimacy of Democratic Kampuchea (the Khmer Rouge government) at the United Nations, the Khmer Rouge could no longer control the Prince.</p>
<p>In his book entitled <italic>Prisonier des Khmer Rouges</italic>, Prince Sihanouk recounted that he had to ask the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to help evacuate him to a place where the Khmer Rouge could not get to him.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_62"><sup>62</sup></xref> Because this request was made in New York, the headquarters of the United Nations, the task was not overly difficult. But then again, the Prince became a one-man operation, as many countries understood that Prince Sihanouk was a maverick politician. Ultimately, only China gave support to Prince Sihanouk. The Prince could run his own movement, which
<target target-type="page" id="page_68"/>would also have an armed wing. Prince Sihanouk also received support from his longtime friend, Marshal Kim Il Sung of North Korea, who provided the Prince with a palace in Pyongyang equipped with all luxurious amenities.</p>
<p>While the Prince was able to establish a political movement, there was still a question surrounding the military arm of the movement. Most of the fighters had already joined the KPNLAF who had structure on the ground. Regardless of the disadvantages, Prince Sihanouk had one clear advan tage over any other people, namely his immense popularity among the Cambodian populace. It was not trivial to have people consider him as the only leader who could end the war. Many people who had lived during prosperous times in the 1960s under the Prince&#x2019;s rule held the belief that &#x201C;the country will not know peace if the King is not in the country.&#x201D; This was a belief that persisted until 1993, and it was a belief that the FUNCINPEC, as a political party, did not hesitate to exploit.</p>
<p>For once, this popularity seemed to help the Prince organize a military arm for his movement, despite not being able to travel freely to the Cambodian-Thai border. The Prince was able to capture the allegiance of one movement that later became the backbone of his army: the MOULINAKA. The <italic>Mouvement pour la Lib&#x00E9;ration de la Nation Khm&#x00E8;re</italic> (MOULINAKA) or translated to English as the Movement for the Liberation of the Khmer Nation, was one of the armed groups that had refused to join the KPNLAF. Formed by Kong Sileah, a former navy captain of the Khmer Republic, the MOULINAKA was truly an independent group, just like its founder. To understand this, one has to go back to the history of Cambodia and Thailand. The kingdom of Siam was much a threat to Cambodia, as it was to Vietnam. However, most of the movements that joined the KPNLF were pragmatic enough to view the Vietnamese as a more pressing threat, and the support of Thailand was essential to be able to counter that threat.</p>
<p>Kong Sileah, however, was an idealist. He was not going to bow to Thailand just because he needed their support to fight against the Vietnamese. Joining the KPNLAF was therefore out of the question despite repeated urges by the senior leaders of the KPNLAF. In one incident, it clashed with the Thai army. According to Conboy, one day a Cambodian female refugee was raped and then murdered by unknown Thai soldiers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_63"><sup>63</sup></xref> Unable to find the assailants, Kong Sileah took matters into his own hands, and the MOULINAKA killed one private in the Thai military as retribution. The Thai local military unit was furious and raided Kong Sileah&#x2019;s camp in retaliation. Kong Sileah and his men had to flee and took shelter near a camp controlled by the KPNLAF.</p>
<p>The MOULINAKA pledged its allegiance to Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s FUNCINPEC and became the backbone of the <italic>Arm&#x00E9;e Nationale Sihanoukhiste</italic> (ANS) which could be translated to English as Sihanouk&#x2019;s National Army. Two other movements joined hands with the MOULINAKA and became part of the ANS. A movement called <italic>Kleing Moeung</italic> (named after a Cambodian
<target target-type="page" id="page_70"/>historical figure in the sixteenth century) pledged allegiance to the FUNCINPEC and became part of the ANS. In fact, part of this group had already decided to join the KPNLAF. Another part decided to follow the Prince. The third group was the <italic>Oddar Tus</italic> (Northern) movement. MOULINAKA became the 1st Brigade, the <italic>Kleing Moeung</italic> became the 2nd Brigade, and <italic>Oddar Tus</italic> became the 3rd Brigade. Together, they formed the heart and soul of the ANS, Samdech Oev&#x2019;s army (King Father&#x2019;s Army), which was committed to returning Prince Sihanouk to his rightful place as the King of Cambodia.</p>

<title>PAVN&#x2019;s response to the one-country-two-administrations: the 1982&#x2013;1983 dry season offensive</title>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<label>3.3.1</label>
<title>One country, two states: military angle</title>
<p>The three resistance movements had their own particularities. Of the three, the Khmer Rouge was the biggest, the most elusive, and the most deadly. Everything associated with this group could be described in superlatives. The Khmer Rouge had also successfully shown that despite the loss of sanctuaries along the border, they still maintained the ability to hit significant targets all over Cambodia. The FUNCINPEC and its armed wing the ANS could be described with only one superlative: having the most legitimate leader, Prince Sihanouk.</p>
<p>The KPNLF, on the other hand, was a different breed, one that caused the PAVN to launch a premature dry season offensive in 1982. The origin of the Vietnamese dry season offensive was essentially political in nature. For five years after the Vietnamese victory in 1979, the guerrillas, especially the KPNLF, had tried to create what Prime Minister Hun Sen of the PRK would later describe as &#x201C;one country, two administrative/state systems.&#x201D; The refugee camps under KPNLF administration were sprawling mini-cities with various institutions that a state would possess: schools, small-scale manufactures, religious institutions, security apparatus, military training camps, propaganda establishment, a school of performing arts, and hospitals.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_64"><sup>64</sup></xref> They would later own a radio station, broadcasting their anthems, nationalistic songs, and other propaganda messages.</p>
<p>On the political front, the CGDK was also very active despite its young history. The KPNLF ran a series of information bulletins, which appeared every fortnight. The bulletin was not a mere leaflet, but it was a rather advanced form of propaganda magazine. The bulletin contained editorials, full-color photos, battlefield information, propaganda messages, political activities, as well as activities of the KPNLF&#x2019;s leaders on the international stage. On the back page, the magazine also had a form that potential subscribers could fill out with their information so the bulletin could be sent to their address.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_71"/>The printing office appeared to be located in the border camps while agents in Bangkok with the alias &#x201C;Kok Sar&#x201D; (Khmer word for &#x201C;White Crane,&#x201D; an important figure in mystic Khmer poetry) took charge of distribution. Kok Sar was one of the small armed group that joined together with others to form the KPNLF. The Movement was the only one with a publication and it was for this reason that the KPNLF put it in charge of the magazine. Foreign aid workers in the camps at the time noted that all printing materials (improvised or otherwise) could be requisitioned in the camps themselves.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_65"><sup>65</sup></xref> The ANS followed suit although the Khmer Rouge had to wait until 1985 to have their own bi-monthly bulletin. Later, the KPNLF bulletin even ran a program called &#x201C;Sponsor a Guerrilla,&#x201D; which called for the Khmer expatriates abroad and international donors to identify and sponsor a KPNLF guerrilla in the fight against the Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.</p>
<p>But these were not the worst nuisances confronting the PAVN in Cambodia. This &#x201C;KPNLF state&#x201D; also had an army and it intended to use it. By 1982, the KPNLF already had a liberation plan of Cambodia. Explanation of the plan could be found in a study by Steve Heder in 1984.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_66"><sup>66</sup></xref> The plan was rather born out of unusual circumstances. One had to go back to the beginning of the KPNLAF. At its inception, General Dien Del was the commander of the movement, but the movement must include other smaller groups in order to consolidate and expand its influence. Among them was one particular group called &#x201C;Nen Rorng&#x201D; (once again, this was a namesake of a Cambodian folklore figure), which was led by a man by the alias Ta Luat. The man was not always on good terms with General Dien Del and the headquarters. One former KPNLAF battalion commander described the relationship as a &#x201C;struggle for power to become high-ranking person.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_67"><sup>67</sup></xref></p>
<p>On 11 October 1981, Ta Luat was called for a meeting with General Dien Del at Banteay Ampil, the headquarter of the KPNLAF. After the meeting, as he left the headquarters, Ta Luat, his pregnant wife, and a bodyguard were assassinated by unknown Cambodian guerrillas.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_68"><sup>68</sup></xref> While General Dien Del claimed the attack was a result of the conspiracy of Thai soldiers who were involved in black market operations with Ta Luat, the soldiers of the former would have none of it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_69"><sup>69</sup></xref> That day, Zone 201 (a battalion formation) under the command of Ta Maing, a close associate of Ta Luat actually fought their fellow KPNLAF soldiers to retrieve the body of its commander. Even today, all of them were convinced that General Dien Del orchestrated the attack.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_70"><sup>70</sup></xref></p>
<p>The event forced President Son Sann to relieve General Dien Del of his duty and he was replaced by a rather loose group of commanders, including Thach Reng, another high-ranking officer of the former Khmer Republic army who had controlled a special force unit in the <italic>ancien r&#x00E9;gime</italic>. This new group was eager to do something to show off their skills. Such was the inception of the Liberation Plan of 1982. Typical of all KPNLAF plans, and of the Khmer Republic army&#x2019;s war plans in the 1970s for that matter, the
<target target-type="page" id="page_72"/>plan looked elegant on paper but was one that would unravel within the proverbial first minute of contact with the enemy. The liberation plan called for a three-stage offensive.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_71"><sup>71</sup></xref></p>
<p>After its formation, the KPNLAF was divided into three sectors called Zones. The Southern Zone operated in the mountainous area of Pursat and Battambang provinces. The Central Zone included Banteay Ampil, the KPNLAF headquarters, in Banteay Meanchey and Ouddar Meanchey area. The last one, the Northern Zone operated in Preah Vihear province. The plan made use of all three Zones. In the first stage, the KPNLAF would drive into Cambodia, stopping at the first major population center, Sisophon in Banteay Meanchey province. In the second stage, the KPNLAF would expand its influence deeper into Cambodia by controlling National Road 5 and 6 using Sisophon as the launching pad. The third stage was the most ambitious of all, which would involve the KPNLAF capturing the Battambang and Pursat provincial capitals as well as controlling a large stretch of National Road 5 and the northern part of the Tonle Sap Lake.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_72"><sup>72</sup></xref></p>
<p>The planned push by the KPNLAF occurred at the border of the area of responsibility of two major Vietnamese military formations. Front 479 operated in Battambang and Siem Reap provinces while Front 579 operated in Preah Vihear and the Northeastern provinces. With such opposing forces, how would the KPNLAF survive the PAVN&#x2019;s counterattack? The KPNLAF also figured that out as well. According to Heder, the KPNLAF&#x2019;s Central Zone would be in charge of the main push.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_73"><sup>73</sup></xref> If Front 479 attacked from the west, then the KPNLAF&#x2019;s Southern Zone would launch guerrilla operations to cut the rear lines of Front 479, forcing it to abandon attack on the Central Zone. Likewise, if Front 579 attacked from the east, the KPNLAF&#x2019;s Northern Zone would launch guerrilla operations to cut the rear lines of Front 579, forcing it to retreat. Obviously, the plan rested on the assumption that simple guerrilla operations would force a PAVN&#x2019;s Front formation that would have tens of thousands of soldiers to retreat (one PAVN Front had more soldiers than the entire KPNLAF, which numbered around seven thousand).</p>
<p>As presented, the plan looked elegant and would have driven the Vietnamese out of Cambodia in only a few years. However, any avid observer with some experience in military planning or anyone who had been through staff college would see things differently. The first major issue is that the plan did not take into account the most dangerous course of action the PAVN could take, namely, conventional operations which would cut through the KNPLAF&#x2019;s &#x201C;liberated areas.&#x201D; Instead, the KPNLAF plan assumed that the PAVN would be a &#x201C;cooperative enemy,&#x201D; which is a dangerous assumption that would be a major flaw in almost any war plans. In this instance, the assumption was that the enemy would fight in such a way that would make one&#x2019;s plan successful, and simple guerrilla operations would send the PAVN running in panic.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_73"/>However, if each PAVN&#x2019;s Front were to allocate even one division to the operation, the PAVN would outnumber the KPNLF&#x2019;s entire force of seven thousand fighters. But such complicated details did not bother the KPNLAF planners. Even the fact that the KPNLAF fighters would carry out this campaign without heavy artillery or the provision of sustained ammunition was not considered to be important.</p>

<title>One country, two states: political and diplomatic angles</title>
<p>Running makeshift state institutions and then claiming to be a state, was an audacious attempt at nation-building, but this was still a long way away from winning the war. Also, the KPNLF was composed of former Khmer Republic veterans, which made them the enemy of Prince Sihanouk.</p>
<p>Both the Prince and the KPNLF hated the Khmer Rouge due to the bitter memories that resulted from contact with each other. For the Khmer Rouge, this feeling was mutual. In other words, the Cambodian resistance movements consisted of three groups that hated each other in equal measure. This was understood by the sponsoring countries, which then worked to bring them all together and unite them against the Vietnamese. But to do that, a way was needed to find a way to deal with the baggage that the Khmer Rouge brought with them.</p>
<p>The infamous legacy of the Khmer Rouge regime was the genocide that killed almost one million people out of the total population of eight million. For the survivors, the Khmer Rouge was an existential threat that they had to fight against at all costs. Preventing the return of the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot&#x2019;s genocidal regime became the main propaganda message of the Vietnamese-backed government, the People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). The PRK established its army called the Kampuchean People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Army (KPRA). The genocide message not only motivated many people to join this army, but this was also used to justify Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia.</p>
<p>From Vietnam&#x2019;s point of view, the intervention was justified because it was based on the grounds that the Khmer Rouge attacked Vietnam first and that Vietnam intervened to put an end to a genocidal regime. In this view, the Vietnamese troops were simply the &#x201C;volunteer army&#x201D; that came into Cambodia for &#x201C;selfless duty for the sake of international socialist solidarity.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_74"><sup>74</sup></xref> Accordingly, the Vietnamese troops in Cambodia called themselves the &#x201C;Vietnamese Volunteer Army.&#x201D; According to this logic, they were not the PAVN, but Vietnamese soldiers who volunteered to fight for the sake of humanity and for the survival of their fellow socialist regime, the PRK.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_75"><sup>75</sup></xref> The sponsoring countries knew the Khmer Rouge alone could not be the leader of the resistance movement, nor was it easy to make it work with other non-communist groups.</p>
<p>The two non-communist resistance movements were caught in an awkward position. For the KPNLF, the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia
<target target-type="page" id="page_74"/>was the materialization of the fear from the 1960s and 1970s of the proverbial <italic>Westward March</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_76"><sup>76</sup></xref> But even though they and the Khmer Rouge now had mutual enemies, they still did not cooperate. Another very important actor in this awkward situation was Prince Sihanouk. The Prince faced a dilemma. He had bitter experiences with the Khmer Rouge. Yet, the Khmer Rouge was the strongest fighting force of the resistance groups opposing the Vietnamese and the PRK. Ultimately, Prince Sihanouk was determined not to be fooled by the Khmer Rouge for a second time, and he created his own movement, the FUNCINPEC. Prince Sihanouk established the movement in February 1981 in France, and in March the same year, the FUNCINPEC absorbed three movements fighting along the Cambodian-Thai border, which formed the core of the ANS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_77"><sup>77</sup></xref> With the ANS as the military wing, albeit the smallest of the resistance movements, Prince Sihanouk could now prevent the FUNCINPEC from degenerating into the movement that he symbolically led in the 1970s: much vanity, but no real power.</p>
<p>However, in spite of having a common and stronger enemy, the three resistance groups worked separately to fight against the Vietnamese forces and the PRK, and they sometimes attacked each other as well. But in 1982, Prince Sihanouk finally gave in to pressure from the sponsoring countries and accepted the establishment of an anti-Vietnamese grand coalition, called the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), which combined the FUNCINPEC, the Khmer Rouge, and the KPNLF into one single political organization opposing the PRK and the Vietnamese. While this was, on the surface, a unified movement, all three constituting movements asserted that it was not an amalgamation of the three movements, and each would still maintain their separate command and control systems as well as their separate identities.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_78"><sup>78</sup></xref> In essence, the CGDK was a political apparatus, although there was no joint command between the three resistance movements. The only military advantage from such a grouping was that now the three agreed not to fight among themselves.</p>
<p>Prince Sihanouk explained his rational, yet excruciating decision:
<disp-quote>
<p>In 1979, 1980, 1981, neither myself nor Mr. Son Sann wanted to enter into a coalition with the Khmer Rouge. But in June 1982, we had to do so after all, because our followers, i.e. the patriotic and nationalist Khmers as a whole, who had decided to fight against the Vietnamese, in order to save our fatherland, would have received neither arms nor ammunition from China nor foodstuffs or any other humanitarian aid from friendly countries nor the support of the UNO [United Nations Organization], if we had remained simple &#x201C;rebels.&#x201D; China and ASEAN gave us to understand that our two nationalist movements, our two national liberation fronts, would not have any future outside the lawful framework of the state of Democratic Kampuchea, a full member of the UNO.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_79"><sup>79</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_75"/>In other words, the Khmer Rouge would be a necessary evil because its government, the Democratic Kampuchea, still retained a seat at the United Nations. This put Vietnam squarely in the position of the aggressor fighting against a sovereign Cambodia, as well as delegitimizing the PRK. In a joint summit by the three resistance movements in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the CGDK was officially proclaimed on 22 June 1982 with Prince Sihanouk as president, Son Sann as the prime minister, and Khieu Samphan of Democratic Kampuchea holding the office of minister of foreign affairs. The compromise established the CGDK as the internationally recognized government of Cambodia during the war, and any resolution to the contrary was consistently voted down at the United Nations. Now the resistance movements not only boasted de facto state structures, they also had a legal foundation for that claim to statehood.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, the Liberation Plan of 1982 was also conceived. After the shakeup of its military structure, the new KPNLAF leadership needed to show real progress. To some extent, it was a timely operation, maybe not feasible, but timely. With the political situation going its way, the resistance movement should now consider some military action.</p>
<p>Therefore, on 27 December 1982, a KPNLAF detachment captured a hamlet by the name of Yeang Dangkum in Battambang&#x2014;Banteay Meanchey province. This isolated hamlet was more of a military outpost manned by the PAVN and the PRK. But by capturing it, the KPNLAF believed that its plan would bear fruit. According to Conboy, the KPNLAF also overran Banteay Chhmar district, albeit controlling it for one night only.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_80"><sup>80</sup></xref></p>
<p>Predictably, these disturbing developments did not sit well with Vietnam and the PRK. In essence, by late 1982, the resistance movements had enough structure to call themselves a state, albeit a very small one. More importantly, all of this happened on Cambodian territory. Not only did they control territory where they ran those institutions, but they had a military that was going to expand that territory as well. At the same time, this exiled government was the internationally recognized government of Cambodia. As Vietnam struggled to build legitimacy for the PRK, such a parallel system could not be tolerated. Therefore, newly defeated in the political and diplomatic arenas, Vietnam had only one card left to play: military might. Such was the origin of the 1983 dry season offensive.</p>

<title>1983: the PAVN flexed its muscles</title>
<p>Yeang Dangkum and Banteay Chhmar were swiftly recaptured by the PAVN. Time was of the essence. In early March 1983, the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, in which Prince Sihanouk was an active participant, were to meet in a summit in New Delhi, India. Vietnam and the PRK were about to receive another round of condemnation. According to some analysts, Vietnam had decided to launch a quick offensive to preempt such eventuality.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_81"><sup>81</sup></xref> According to the <italic>Far Eastern Economic Review</italic>, on 31 January
<target target-type="page" id="page_76"/>1983, the PAVN launched an offensive on Nong Chan, a border camp belonging to the KPNLF, which was also settled by the MOULINAKA before it became the ANS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_82"><sup>82</sup></xref> Considered as the land bridge from which one could channel the guerrillas and war mat&#x00E9;riels into the interior of Cambodia, the camp had forty thousand refugees and was defended by thousands of guerrillas. The PAVN was reported to have used the 10th Division manned by northern regulars to attack the camp.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_83"><sup>83</sup></xref> After two days of fierce defense, the MOULINAKA and the KPNLAF were forced to abandon the camp after it became clear that the camp could not be held without heavy losses for the defenders.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_84"><sup>84</sup></xref></p>
<p>On 5 February, the PAVN massed forces to prepare for the assault on two other camps. On 8 February, the <italic>Far Eastern Economic Review</italic> reported that the PAVN used twenty-five T-54 main battle tanks to assault Nong Samet and Ban Sangae, both of which were not very far from Nong Chan.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_85"><sup>85</sup></xref> At Ban Sagnae, the new KPNLAF commander, Thach Reng, boasted a three-tier defense line to protect the camp that had 21,000 civilians and 5,000 guerrillas.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_86"><sup>86</sup></xref> The seven thousand men of PAVN&#x2019;s 7th Division supported by tanks moved from the eastern provinces in Cambodia to attack the camp.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_87"><sup>87</sup></xref> The camps were set ablaze and the guerrillas retreated. This incident was the first time the Vietnamese and Thai soldiers fought against each other. The Thai military supreme commander, General Arthit Komlang-ek, told the press that the encounter killed five Thai soldiers and both sides exchanged artillery fire and in one instance Thailand also launched an air attack.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_88"><sup>88</sup></xref></p>
<p>On 31 March, the PAVN onslaught turned to the Khmer Rouge at Phnom Chat, which was yet another resistance camp.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_89"><sup>89</sup></xref> Two regimental task forces of the PAVN&#x2019;s 75th Division from Sisophon squared off against twenty-five hundred Khmer Rouge fighters.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_90"><sup>90</sup></xref> Adept in fighting the multi-stage People&#x2019;s War, however, the Khmer Rouge did not put up stiff resistance in the face of a large and stronger force. Nevertheless, it was reported that the PAVN lost fifty men and had two hundred wounded.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_91"><sup>91</sup></xref></p>
<p>On 3 April 1983, the PAVN attacked two other camps, this time the camps belonging to the FUNCINPEC. O&#x2019;Bok and O&#x2019;Smach had thirty thousand civilians and were defended by a combined force of two thousand guerrillas. The PAVN&#x2019;s 72nd Division from Samraong district in Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey province moved about one hundred kilometers northeast to attack the two camps.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_92"><sup>92</sup></xref> On 4 April, the two camps fell to the PAVN.</p>
<p>The offensive seemed to die down after the attack on the FUNCINPEC camps. The KPNLF&#x2019;s headquarters at Banteay Ampil was surprisingly left untouched by the PAVN. The offensive in 1983 seemed to be aimed at all three factions of the CGDK. In response to the offensive, China resumed their shelling of Vietnam&#x2019;s northern border, although the shelling was nowhere near the scale of what happened in 1979 and it was aimed at random targets, ostensibly to deliver more of a &#x201C;lesson&#x201D; than to achieve any significant military result.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_93"><sup>93</sup></xref> The 1983 dry season offensive ended with
<target target-type="page" id="page_77"/>anti-climactic events. After destroying the camps, and after the resistance movements retreated, the PAVN also retreated to the rear, allowing the resistance to move back in and re-establish the camps.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_94"><sup>94</sup></xref></p>
<p>Evidence seemed to suggest that the PAVN&#x2019;s dry season offensive in 1983 was a makeshift solution to fast-paced political, military, and diplomatic developments that far outstripped what the Vietnamese had planned. If we are to believe what a senior officer of the PAVN&#x2019;s Front 479 described about the Vietnamese strategy in Cambodia, then Vietnam wanted to build a friendly and viable regime capable of defending itself.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_95"><sup>95</sup></xref> In 1983, this objective was not yet completed because the largest military formation that the PRK could field was the brigade, and its new divisions were still inexperienced. Even if the 1983 campaign was successful, the PRK would not be mature enough to take on responsibilities. In this case, the PAVN would need to launch another campaign when the PRK was mature enough.</p>
<p>But the aggressive policy and success of the resistance movements forced the PAVN&#x2019;s hand. The PAVN was forced to launch a military campaign to derail some of the CGDK&#x2019;s progress, even if it meant dragging along the young KPRA units. Most of the KPRA units were deployed either in reserve or in support roles at the rear.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_96"><sup>96</sup></xref> In one example, the KPRA unit had to build its strength and upgrade itself in the midst of the intense campaign. That was the root of the problem that decisively put a brake on the PAVN&#x2019;s offensive in 1983.</p>
<p>The following is a never before published account of what could have been the cause of the Vietnamese purge on the PRK officials in the midst of the 1983 campaign.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_97"><sup>97</sup></xref></p>
<p>In early 1983, in order to prepare for cooperation with the PAVN&#x2019;s offensive to come, the General Staff Headquarters of the KPRA sent a company of highly trained soldiers to reinforce its newly established 286th Division in Siem Reap province. The company was described as a group of soldiers trained in the <italic>Dac Biet Cong Tac</italic> (special operations) tradition, which was a renowned skill in the PAVN. During the Vietnam War, American soldiers came to know this type of soldier as &#x201C;sappers&#x201D; who often crept up during the night and stormed fortified outposts. The mission was dubbed &#x201C;special&#x201D; and rightly so, due to the inherent danger in launching frontal assaults on fortified targets. During the Vietnam War, those who volunteered for the mission usually received much accolade before these battles.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_98"><sup>98</sup></xref></p>
<p>This reputation also extended to those non-Vietnamese troops who had received such training. A company of <italic>Dac Cong</italic> troops could be worth as much as a battalion or a regiment, or so the trainees believed. These were varieties of the same theme that were repeated again and again by the soldiers of the <italic>Dac Cong</italic> company who were travelling to the 286th Division.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_99"><sup>99</sup></xref> During their trip to the headquarters of the 286th Division, they had camped on National Road 6 (in Kralanh district) at the junction road that would lead north to Samraong district. One has to note that while the trip today
<target target-type="page" id="page_78"/>would take hours, the condition of the road at the time was so bad (due to years of neglect and destruction resulting from repeated military operations) that the trip could take days. During the night at Kralanh, the four ZIL-130 trucks carrying the <italic>Dac Cong</italic> company stopped and the soldiers camped near a cluster of several hamlets. During their chat with the local populace, the soldiers made the mistake of telling the locals who they were, what they were trained to do, and where they planned to go. Some of the locals were undercover Khmer Rouge agents who wasted no time in relaying this information to their comrades at Srey Snom district to the north. To the Khmer Rouge soldiers, the word <italic>Dac Cong</italic> did not strike fear into their psyche; after all, they had seen worse and they, too, had trained in such trade.</p>
<p>The next day, the Khmer Rouge ambush destroyed two trucks and killed a number of KPRA soldiers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_100"><sup>100</sup></xref> The other two trucks were able to escape the ambush and then contacted nearby units for reinforcement. What was more interesting was that the local KPRA militias learnt of the ambush and, on their own initiative, moved to the site to help their comrades. Unfortunately for them, their arrival on the scene coincided with the arrival of the other KPRA reinforcement that the <italic>Dac Cong</italic> company had called earlier. The Khmer Rouge soldiers had long gone from the scene, but the KPRA reinforcement was unaware of this, and thought that the KPRA militias were an underground Khmer Rouge network who had attacked the convoy. A combination of suspicions and confusion led the reinforcement, some of which were composed of Vietnamese units, to arrest the KPRA militias.</p>
<p>From Vietnam&#x2019;s point of view, it was nearly impossible to determine who was Khmer Rouge and who was not. The investigation then widened and reached up from the hamlets to the provincial level. Under violent interrogation, which perhaps the interrogators thought justified after the savage ambush on their comrades, the militias then spuriously blamed other people. Those other people then blamed the upper echelons and soon, most of the province was under suspicion of collaborating with the Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>Naturally, one cannot find mention of such events in the official publication of the KPRA at the time. The accounts of what happened next came only from interviews and the publications of the CGDK. One of the most comprehensive accounts at the time was the KPNLF bulletin, which appeared on 5 August 1983.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_101"><sup>101</sup></xref> It seemed that the purge had not yet run its course, even four months after the event. The KPNLF bulletin claimed that the following figures were arrested by the PAVN: the governor and deputy governor of Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey; commander of the Siem Reap PMC; political commissar of the Siem Reap PMC; and a high-profile local party official. The KPRA&#x2019;s oral accounts corroborated this claim, as also did the reports from the <italic>Far Eastern Economic Review</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_102"><sup>102</sup></xref> The majority of the party officials in the Kralanh and Srey Snom districts (where the event occurred) were also purged. Without resolution on this issue, the PAVN
<target target-type="page" id="page_79"/>simply could not launch any serious campaign along the border against the CGDK. The 1983 dry season offensive did indeed produce results, but these could never be considered to have been decisive.</p>
<p>It was not until late 1983 that the PAVN began to realize the flaws of its investigation and accepted that their suspicions were baseless. In a move that was surprising to some observers, the PAVN Supreme Headquarters in Cambodia then moved to shake up the command structure of Front 479 that had handled the investigation. Some claimed that the commander of Front 479 was transferred to an administrative job at the Tan Son Nhut airfield in Saigon and several mid-rank commanders had their future promotion rescinded.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_103"><sup>103</sup></xref></p>
<p>At an official conference in Japan in 2012, the author met a Vietnamese officer whose father happened to be a colonel of Front 479 during that purge. The officer went so far as to claim that his father refused further promotion after realizing the errors of his ways. What was even more interesting was that the colonel was part of a second special forces team that the PAVN had sent to rescue Prince Sihanouk in January 1979. The first team was decimated by the Khmer Rouge and the second team decided to abort the operation, according to this account.</p>
<p>It is not easy to truly assess whether and how much the Vietnamese regretted the event and what they did to their innocent Cambodian comrades. What was clear, however, was that the event was a huge embarrassment for the PAVN in Cambodia and it also prevented the PAVN from making the 1983 dry season offensive a decisive one. This is because in order to make the campaign decisive, the PAVN needed to ensure that the PRK could govern what was liberated from the CGDK. The purge denied the Vietnamese such an opportunity. Perhaps because of this reason, the 1983 campaign appeared to satisfy other moderate objectives, namely, the containment of CGDK activities, probing attacks to learn about the CGDK border camps, and finally the test of Thailand&#x2019;s resolve in the event of a Thai&#x2013;Vietnamese clash.</p>
<p>The Siem Reap purge also saw the PAVN replacing a senior commander of Front 479 with Major General Phung Dinh Am who, according to his autobiography, had fought wars in Cambodia for three generations.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_104"><sup>104</sup></xref> One could only wonder if the PAVN had decided to appoint someone who had more history of interactions with Cambodian soldiers and people in order to make sure nothing like the purge, or its origins, would ever happen again.</p>
<p>There was also re-organization of the resistance movements. The Khmer Rouge was still not amendable to working with the non-communists, and vice versa. The KPNLAF and the ANS, however, became closer. After the flawed 1982 Liberation Plan was abandoned in the face of the fierce PAVN offensive, General Dien Del returned to the border and assumed his previous position. On the ANS side, General In Tam (former premier under Prince Sihanouk in the 1960s) was blamed for the loss of the two ANS camps in 1983, and was relieved of his duty as commander of the ANS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_105"><sup>105</sup></xref> He was
<target target-type="page" id="page_80"/>replaced by General Teap Ben who analysts saw as more amendable to working with the KPNLAF.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_106"><sup>106</sup></xref> Kong Sileah, founder of the MOULINAKA died under mysterious circumstances in 1980 and was replaced by Nhem Sophon, who was also thought to be open to working with the KPNLAF.</p>
<p>On the KPNLAF side, many people also wanted to join the ANS in building some form of coalition to counter the Khmer Rouge. One of the prime movers for this idea was Abdul Gaffar Peang-Meth who was formerly secretary to President Son Sann. This did not please the President as he was not enamored of the idea of a joint command. Such a structure would erode more of Son Sann&#x2019;s authority as a joint military command would need to have some independent power in decision-making to respond to battlefield contingencies. According to some accounts, Abdul Gaffar was appointed by President Son Sann as the CGDK&#x2019;s ambassador to Egypt, an attempt to get Abdul Gaffar away from the border and paralyze the organization of the joint military command. But the military faction countermanded that decision and kept Abdul Gaffar along the border, claiming the movement needed him on the field.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_107"><sup>107</sup></xref> Instead, from 1984 to 1986, Abdul Gaffar was appointed Director of Information and Planning of a joint KPNLAF-ANS military committee called PERMICO (Permanent Military Committee for Coordination). His counterpart in PERMICO was ANS official Tol Lah.</p>
<p>The formation of the PERMICO had its uses, however, especially with regards to the relations between the non-communist resistance and ASEAN in general, and Thailand in particular. The groups started to receive ammunition supplies from the ASEAN countries. With ASEAN&#x2019;s support, PERMICO officials were provided with a safe house in Bangkok, and free access to and from the Khmer-Thai border at all times, especially during the Vietnamese military offensives in 1984 and after.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_108"><sup>108</sup></xref> Indeed, these developments came at the expense of the KPNLF, where the rift was now unable to be bridged. The rift would later affect the performance of the PERMICO and its subsequent successor, the Joint Military Command.</p>

<title>PAVN&#x2019;s 1984&#x2013;1985 dry season offensive: the 16-Camps Campaign</title>
<p>The year 1983 ended with both sides unable to launch significant military operations. The PAVN was preoccupied with the purge of the PRK officials in Siem Reap province, an affair that had turned scandalous. The CGDK was able to regain the camps after the PAVN withdrawal but did not have enough power to launch any decisive campaign. The Khmer Rouge then stepped in and, perhaps by taking advantage of the confusion on the PRK side in Siem Reap, launched an intense guerrilla campaign, which had not been seen since 1979.</p>
<p>In January 1984, Paul Quinn-Judge of the <italic>Far Eastern Economic Review</italic> reported that there was an intensification of Khmer Rouge attacks, which he attributed to the availability of supplies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_109"><sup>109</sup></xref> He also reported the Khmer
<target target-type="page" id="page_81"/>Rouge&#x2019;s claim of capturing many provinces during the attacks. The KPRA sources, however, only pointed to one instance where the Khmer Rouge had attacked the Siem Reap provincial capital, but they did not try to hold it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_110"><sup>110</sup></xref> Nonetheless, the attack was considered a serious embarrassment, and the KPRA yet again replaced the commander of the Siem Reap provincial military command.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_111"><sup>111</sup></xref> Perhaps, it seemed that the PAVN had learned the lessons of the purge in 1983 and did not allow that attack to provoke another wave of purges. Only the commander of the provincial military command took the blame, which was an understandable decision. The Khmer Rouge attacks subsided soon after, with Western analysts estimating that the Khmer Rouge lost a total of about four hundred fighters in the shortlived campaign, which was above average in that timeframe.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_112"><sup>112</sup></xref></p>
<p>Once again, the PAVN needed to respond. But as the PAVN started a build-up around the camps that the resistance movements had regained, China stepped in. In April, there was an artillery exchange on Vietnam&#x2019;s northern border as well as regimental level raids.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_113"><sup>113</sup></xref> Such skirmishes did nothing to deter Vietnam. On 5 April 1984, elements from the Vietnamese 95th Regiment and the 6th Division formed the first axis of advance while elements from the 201st Regiment and the 302nd Division formed the second axis, and both launched an attack into Thailand.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_114"><sup>114</sup></xref> In a surprise move, the Vietnamese forces captured much high ground in Thai territory. In retaliation to this attack, the Chinese restarted shelling into Vietnamese territory to retaliate against what China thought was once again, a Vietnamese expansion in Indochina.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_115"><sup>115</sup></xref></p>
<p>Twelve days later, the Thai 6th Division counterattacked and recaptured the lost territories. The battle was ferocious, with both sides committing tanks and heavy artillery.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_116"><sup>116</sup></xref> The attack occurred in an area known as the &#x201C;Triangle Area,&#x201D; the intersection of the border between Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, further away from the threatened Battambang-Banteay Meanchey province. For the KPRA officers on the ground, however, the attack was rather a feint and Vietnam was clever enough not to fight both Thailand and China at the same time and incur the wrath of the international community. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_117"><sup>117</sup></xref></p>
<p>There was an assumption that Thailand would support the Cambodian resistance movements in the event the Vietnamese attacked the border camps.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_118"><sup>118</sup></xref> Perhaps the attack was launched to test Thailand&#x2019;s resolve and reactions as well as probing for the possibility to attack a major FUNCINPEC camp. Located near the Thai village of Tatum, the FUNCINPEC camp also took this namesake, and it housed the FUNCINPEC and ANS headquarters. The camp was located along the Cambodian-Thai border with almost sheer vertical cliffs on the Cambodian side but flat land on the Thai side. Any assault on the camp had to come from Thai territory. Vietnam wanted to know how Thailand would respond and it seemed Thailand did not want to get involved directly unless it was pushed to the wall.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_82"/>On 15 April 1984, perhaps having learned something about Thailand&#x2019;s intentions, the PAVN shifted its attention to another camp, Banteay Ampil, the headquarters of the KPNLAF. It was estimated that about one thousand soldiers from the PAVN&#x2019;s 75th Division and the 8th Border Regiment participated in the ferocious attack on Banteay Ampil.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_119"><sup>119</sup></xref> General Dien Del had built the Banteay Ampil base into a formidable fortification with three lines of defenses, although the lack of heavy support weapons seemed to neutralize some of the protection provided by the three lines. After twenty minutes of relentless assault, the PAVN was able to get through to the second line of defense but it was ultimately beaten back by the KPNLAF counterattack.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_120"><sup>120</sup></xref> After one week of action, the battle of Banteay Ampil was over and the inability of the PAVN to capture the base was considered by the senior KPNLF leadership to be a morale boost.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_121"><sup>121</sup></xref></p>
<p>Speaking to the press after the operation was called off, Vietnam&#x2019;s minister of foreign affairs, Nguyen Co Thach played down the negative outcome of the operation by saying that &#x201C;They are small fish, so the net this year is as small as last year.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_122"><sup>122</sup></xref> Vietnam maintained a theme that the operations in the dry season of 1984 were merely police operations along the border and not any attempt to decisively defeat the resistance movement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_123"><sup>123</sup></xref> It seemed that the KPRA was still not mature enough by then. In early August 1984, the ANS had tried to recapture O&#x2019;Smach by using six hundred soldiers to attack the position that was manned by two battalions of the KPRA.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_124"><sup>124</sup></xref> The attack was cut short by instability in the CGDK when, in the same month, Prince Sihanouk expressed his anger and threatened to resign from the presidency of the CGDK over allegations of Khmer Rouge attacks on the ANS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_125"><sup>125</sup></xref></p>
<p>In summary, during the rainy season of 1984 (from around June to October), both the CGDK and the PAVN were locked in a stalemate with both sides unable to launch major operations. The CGDK, on their part, believed that the PAVN would launch yet another dry season offensive in 1984&#x2013;1985 and that they would be able to repel the PAVN once again. But by the rainy season of 1984, the KPRA had established four divisions, the 4th Division, the 179th Division, the 196th Division, and the 286th Division. It now seemed that the KPRA was mature enough to take on responsibility for itself.</p>
<p>The PAVN campaign in the dry season offensive of 1984&#x2013;1985 started as soon as the rain stopped. Even Western analysts were surprised by the unusually early PAVN offensive.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_126"><sup>126</sup></xref> After all, in 1983, it was not until January that the PAVN started to fight and in 1984 it was in April, almost at the end of the dry season. As events unfolded, it was clear that the PAVN was ready to end this once and for all in 1984 and 1985.</p>
<p>On 18 November 1984, as the ground was hardening at the beginning of the dry season, the PAVN&#x2019;s largest dry season offensive in Cambodia commenced. The campaign was aptly dubbed &#x201C;16-Camps Campaign.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_127"><sup>127</sup></xref> At the conclusion of the campaign, all sixteen camps belonging to the CGDK,
<target target-type="page" id="page_83"/>large and small, were razed to the ground, sending the refugees and the guerrilla fighters into Thailand. The first camp to be hit by this operation was Nong Chan, which housed the KPNLAF&#x2019;s Political Warfare School.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_128"><sup>128</sup></xref> In mid-December, the KPNLF lost two medium camps, Baksei and Sok Sann, both of which were located in Pursat province, formerly known as the Southern Zone. On 25 December, the KPNLF lost Nong Samet.</p>
<p>Once again, the Khmer Rouge showed that the time was not ripe for a fixed defense. With expansive underground networks all over the country, the Khmer Rouge did not worry so much about the loss of the camps, perhaps with the exception of the Malai base, which had been the showcase of the Khmer Rouge state structure for the foreign media. In mid-December, a camp in Preah Vihear province called Ta Luan was evacuated and on 4 January, a nearby camp named Paet Um was also evacuated.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_129"><sup>129</sup></xref> Phnom Malai, which the Khmer Rouge used as a sanctuary and as a living room to receive foreign guests, media, and dignitaries, was expected to be a tough fight for the PAVN and it was estimated that at least a division would be required to assault the stronghold.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_130"><sup>130</sup></xref> To the surprise of many experts, including the Chinese military experts, however, the Khmer Rouge evacuated from Phnom Malai with haste, disabusing everyone of the notion that Phnom Malai would be a bloodbath.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_131"><sup>131</sup></xref></p>
<p>In other words, the faction that was hit the hardest was the KPNLF. It received disproportionate attention when one considers its size in the CGDK. But then, the Khmer Rouge was too elusive and the KPNLF showcased too much of its state structure. It was only logical for the PAVN to concentrate its efforts on the KPNLF. In early January 1985, the long-awaited assault on the KPNLAF headquarters at Banteay Ampil began. The PAVN was reported to have allocated between three to four regiments to the assault, consisting of between 3,500 to 4,000 troops, supported by 20 armored vehicles (including between 12 to 15 T-54 tanks) and 18 artillery pieces.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_132"><sup>132</sup></xref> Certainly, this was not a probing attack or police operation. Thailand estimated that seven thousand rounds of artillery fell on Banteay Ampil on the first day of the assault, an artillery bombardment that witnesses reported to have been very accurate, and not many shells fell on Thai territory.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_133"><sup>133</sup></xref> Perhaps the PAVN had learned well from its previous campaign.</p>
<p>To date, there has never been any published account about the layout of Banteay Ampil&#x2019;s three lines of defense. But one can get a glimpse of the layout in a memoir of a PAVN soldier who had participated in that very assault. A soldier of the 4th Regiment, 5th Division, Front 479, who had participated in the attack recounted:
<disp-quote>
<p>Scouts said the base was defended by 10,000 gunmen, with 130mm down to the personal rifles &#x2026; Ampil base had altogether three defense lines which were three concentric arcs, far away from each other about eight hundred yards. Each defense line was a wide high earth bank, behind it was four foot deep trench. Along the lines, every fifty yards,
<target target-type="page" id="page_84"/>there was a big shelter, with many log layers upon it, the diameter of each log was at least two feet. In addition, there were open gun emplacements for the personal and machine gunners. Between these lines were the minefields.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_134"><sup>134</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<p>Artillery was the key to PAVN success. The precise artillery bombardment gave Thailand no reason to intervene. The artillery also suppressed and cut off Banteay Ampil&#x2019;s three lines of defense from reinforcing and supporting each other. Then, in a manner similar to Soviet assault tactics in World War II, following the fierce artillery bombardment that saturated the lines came the tank assault. Some of the PAVN&#x2019;s tanks did fall victim to the anti-tank mines, but most of them got through. In the early morning of 7 January 1985, KPNLAF fighters started to hear the tanks moving in the camp.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_135"><sup>135</sup></xref> On that very day, 7 January 1985, the sixth anniversary of the KPSFNS liberation of Phnom Penh, the PAVN and the PRK captured the KPNLAF headquarters.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_136"><sup>136</sup></xref></p>
<p>The 16-Camps Campaign did not conclude until the assault on the FUNCINPEC and ANS headquarters at Tatum (also known as Green Hill, the preferred name used in the ANS bulletin) in March 1985, but the fall of Banteay Ampil was the climax of the campaign. After its headquarters fell, the KPNLF decided to evacuate Sanro, and the next day, the FUNCINPEC lost O&#x2019;Bok.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_137"><sup>137</sup></xref> On 5 March 1985, the PAVN launched the long-awaited assault on Ta Tum camp, the last major stronghold of the resistance movement. Between the fall of Banteay Ampil and the beginning of the assault on Ta Tum, all other smaller camps had either been evacuated as a precautionary measure, or evacuated after some initial attacks. Ta Tum was the 16th camp, the last prize of the campaign.</p>
<p>Just like the operations in other camps, the assault on Ta Tum started with a vicious artillery bombardment. There was only one tactical problem with attacking Ta Tum. As the cliff was too steep on the Cambodian side, using tanks was not ideal. Even the infantry assault would be extremely difficult. The PAVN then infiltrated into Thai territory to attack the camp from more favorable terrain. Although the attack started on 5 March, it could not be immediately directed towards Ta Tum. Instead, the battle raged for the control of a series of hills inside Thai territory from which the PAVN could use as launching points to attack Ta Tum camp.</p>
<p>On 8 March, it was reported that as many as one thousand PAVN troops had crossed into Thailand.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_138"><sup>138</sup></xref> Hundreds were said to have been pushed back into Cambodian territory while the remaining PAVN troops were cut off and had laid mines to try to repel the Thai counterattack.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_139"><sup>139</sup></xref> According to Conboy, the PAVN launched a multi-pronged attack on the camp for several days until 8 March, when a fateful artillery round fell on the ANS command bunker and killed King Men, a senior commander of the ANS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_140"><sup>140</sup></xref> Finally, the ANS heeded Prince Sihanouk&#x2019;s call to abandon the camp to avoid a bloodbath.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_141"><sup>141</sup></xref> War mat&#x00E9;riels, fighters and civilians had already been
<target target-type="page" id="page_85"/>evacuated from the camp when the PAVN finally broke through. Several days later, Prince Sihanouk personally oversaw the funeral of General King Men.</p>
<p>The assault then became a protracted encounter between the PAVN and the Thai army that continued, on and off, until June 1985. Casualties for both sides were heavy, especially for the PAVN. Conboy noted that the estimates for the PAVN casualties ranged from 125 to 2,000 dead while the ANS suffered only 150 killed and 200 wounded.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_142"><sup>142</sup></xref> The casualties on the Thai side were much less. The PAVN did not stay in the camp, however. They knew the operation was more about the symbolic destruction of the &#x201C;one country, two states&#x201D; problematic, not the territorial control, at least not at Ta Tum. A former ANS soldier put it bluntly:
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hile it was hard to attack Ta Tum from the Cambodian side, the camp was also not an ideal guerrilla camp as we needed to walk at least one day into the interior before coming into contact with any habitable village.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_143"><sup>143</sup></xref></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>After the operation, the ANS returned and the camp remained an important stronghold for the FUNCINPEC. Nevertheless, the PAVN declared victory with the fall of Ta Tum in March 1985. The PAVN then allowed the soldiers of the KPRA&#x2019;s 286th Division to march into the ANS headquarter to facilitate a historic photoshoot.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_144"><sup>144</sup></xref> The 16-Camps Campaign was concluded.</p>

<title>Aftermath of the PAVN&#x2019;s 1985 dry season offensive</title>
<p>The 16-Camps Campaign was a turning point for all of the four factions in the Cambodian civil war but also for the Vietnamese. The Khmer Rouge finally did away with relying on fortified camps (with the exception of two camps in Thailand called Site 8 and Site K) and returned to its traditional guerrilla tactics. The KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC also switched to guerrilla tactics, as well as increasing their cooperation. The Vietnamese, on the other hand, had found it timely to transfer responsibilities to the KPRA. This section is concerned with the development within the CGDK while the next chapter will discuss the PAVN and the KPRA.</p>
<p>It became clear after the facts that all of the Vietnamese offensives were mainly aimed at the non-communist groups, particularly the KPNLF. That was only logical. Since the Khmer Rouge was elusive and the KPNLF was the only one that showcased most of the state structures. In a meeting with General Chavalit of Thailand after the 16-Camps Campaign, Pol Pot categorically rejected the notion that the PAVN had gained anything. He was reported to have said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not worried about losing the border bases. Now I don&#x2019;t have to look in two directions [to the interior and the frontier] at once.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_145"><sup>145</sup></xref> Pol Pot&#x2019;s claim seemed quite credible given the fact that the Khmer Rouge activities did not abate after the 1985 offensive. On the
<target target-type="page" id="page_86"/>contrary, the NADK now concentrated their effort on Battle Zone 1 and adopted a relentless guerrilla campaign all over the country.</p>
<p>It was around this time that the Khmer Rouge started publishing their political and military bulletin. One should also note that the much-vaunted KPNLF bulletin more or less ceased operation after the 16-Camps Campaign. For the entire year of 1985, the bulletin no longer contained all of its interesting features, and instead, published only international media clippings and whole speeches. Even the photos were in black and white format. The editorial address also changed from Bangkok to New York. It was not until 1986 that the KPNLF with the old, elaborate format returned. Unfortunately for the KPNLF, the first article of the first volume of the 1986 bulletin had an ominous title &#x201C;Who owns the KPNLF?&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_146"><sup>146</sup></xref> The article offered a unifying answer &#x201C;it belongs to the people,&#x201D; but the answer was quite unconvincing and instead exposed that the rift within the KPNLF was still not healed. Apparently, the PAVN offensive did not have any unifying effect on the KPNLF.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Khmer Rouge inaugurated their first bulletin in October 1985. The <italic>Bulletin of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea</italic> (NADK bulletin) appeared bi-monthly and contained colored photos with short captions describing the NADK&#x2019;s military exploits during the period. In the first volume, the editors published a series of photos to showcase their much-promoted all-female transportation units. In other words, the KPNLF&#x2019;s resources seemed to dwindle, at least in the immediate aftermath of the 16-Camps Campaign, while the Khmer Rouge was able to avoid the attrition afflicted by the PAVN campaign. After 1985, it became increasingly clear that the Khmer Rouge could easily become the resistance&#x2019;s dominant military power on the battlefield, boasting a formidable force totaling around thirty thousand armed men, whose combat experience stretched back as far as the 1960s. This threat perhaps united the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC even more than the PAVN did. The plan was then promulgated for the upgrade of cooperation between the non-communist groups. The advocates of such a move would call the two movements (FUNCINPEC and KPNLF) the non-communist resistance.</p>
<p>One notable event in 1985 was when both non-communist forces agreed to pool their military resources and created a Joint Military Command (JMC). In 1985, ANS military commander Gen Teap Ben hand carried to Beijing a document on the creation of the KPNLAF-ANS Joint Military Command to request CGDK President Prince Norodom Sihanouk&#x2019;s approval.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_147"><sup>147</sup></xref> As the name implied, this was not a mere coordination group like the PERMICO, but a full-fledged joint military command, at least on paper. The Prince put his signature on the document, thus formalizing the JMC as the replacement of the PERMICO on 4 January 1986. From 1986 until 1989, the JMC would be manned by both the officers from the ANS and the KPNLAF. General Sak Sutsakhan of the KPNLAF was Commanderin-Chief of the JMC, General Teap Ben of the ANS served as Deputy
<target target-type="page" id="page_87"/>Commander-in-Chief and General Toan Chay of the ANS was the Chief of Staff. The JMC had several deputy chiefs of staff from both the KPNLAF and the ANS who co-led different functional branches of the General Staff Headquarters.</p>
<p>In addition, in 1987, Abdul Gaffar Peang-Meth was made Deputy Chief of General Staff of the KPNLAF for Planning and Analysis (PLANA) department. Abdul Gaffar created a special unit called the Armed Political, Psychological, and Clandestine Operations (APPCO), which was to operate as guerrilla units attacking behind the PAVN and KPRA lines. He actually wanted it to remain in place even after the political settlement had been reached between the factions, perhaps using it as a bargaining chip in future power struggles after the war ended.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_148"><sup>148</sup></xref> At its inception, the APPCO did not meet with much objection since the resistance groups were still reeling from the effect of the 16-Camps Campaign. When the APPCO fighters were arrested in the interior due to their encumbered gears, thus blowing their cover, the KPNLAF created yet another unit called the Clandestine Operations Service whose main task was sabotage and spreading terror to undermine the PRK&#x2019;s authority.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_149"><sup>149</sup></xref> The operatives carried light loads consisting of grenades and other explosives and were credited with several small explosions in Phnom Penh, although the attacks did not kill anyone.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_150"><sup>150</sup></xref> It was only fitting to adopt guerrilla tactical doctrine.</p>
<p>But infighting within both the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC sealed the JMC&#x2019;s fate even before it was born. The KPNLAF along the Cambodian-Thai border openly rebelled against President Son Sann and created a parallel movement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_151"><sup>151</sup></xref> This rift was only put under control by Task Force 828 of the Thai army and the American CIA.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_152"><sup>152</sup></xref></p>
<p>The FUNCINPEC did not experience any rift on that scale. This led some disheartened KPNLAF units to defect to the FUNCINPEC and become part of the ANS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_153"><sup>153</sup></xref> Problems between senior commanders meant that the JMC became a place of exile for any commanders who were not liked by senior leaders in their movements. As such, it should come as no surprise that a truly joint military command existed only on paper. The last JMC operational plan was a typed 29-page &#x201C;Operational Plan of the Non-Communist Resistance Forces for 1989,&#x201D; dated 29 October 1988. The JMC played the ASEAN card and received several thousand weapons and ammunition, training of different sorts from ASEAN, and invaluable political and diplomatic support from sources other than Beijing. But as we shall see later in this chapter, the JMC arrangement at the top did not trickle down to the tactical level when the CGDK launched the final offensive against the PRK in 1989.</p>
<p>Finally, another problem came from the sponsoring countries. Many sponsors such as the Thai Army&#x2019;s Task Force 838 inadvertently exacerbated the problem when they decided to offer financial rewards for success, leading many non-communist rebel forces to fight for money instead of a political ideology. One American advisor noted that many, if not all, non-communist
<target target-type="page" id="page_88"/>camps&#x2019; leaders ruled as warlords and cared little about the people inside, while the Khmer Rouge elected the camp leaders.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_154"><sup>154</sup></xref> A last point related to the financing of the non-communist resistance fighters was the multi-layered corruption reportedly perpetuated by the advisors themselves. Some estimated that one third of the CIA money and about half of the Chinese money was lost under the management of the Thai Army.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_155"><sup>155</sup></xref></p>
<p>In retrospect, the establishment of the CGDK and the JMC, while not without contradictions and problems, indeed represented progress for the resistance. First and foremost, it prevented the communist and non-communist rebel forces from attacking each other. Many Khmer Rouge soldiers considered the Serei Ka (Khmer for &#x201C;freedom fighters,&#x201D; a nickname they gave to the KPNLAF) and the Para (from the word &#x201C;paratroopers,&#x201D; a name given to the ANS based on the woodland camouflaged uniform they wore) as bandits who would intimidate the local population as much as they fought against the Vietnamese.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_156"><sup>156</sup></xref> The Khmer Rouge often attacked both non-communist groups, and only the establishment of the CGDK had mitigated some of that risk.</p>
<p>Over time, however, the Khmer Rouge also operated as vanguard units to facilitate the infiltration of the non-communist forces into the interior.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_157"><sup>157</sup></xref> The main problem for the non-communist resistance was that only the Khmer Rouge could maintain an expansive network among the population. Without the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s acquiescence, it would be next to impossible for the non-communist forces to infiltrate into Cambodia in large formation.</p>
<p>The CGDK mechanism helped alleviate some of these problems. To be fair, not all of the non-communist fighters were opportunists or totally lacking in discipline. Many of them were truly freedom fighters, but many others did originate from the armed groups who profited from the lawless period that reigned over the refugee camps before the political establishment of the resistance movement. To a certain extent, the Khmer Rouge was willing to tolerate the presence of its non-communist forces as long as they did not cause a nuisance to the local population under the protection of the NADK.</p>
<p>Despite all of these hardships, and benefiting from the CGDK and JMC organizations, the KPNLAF and the ANS struggled to build their forces for the eventual offensive that would follow the PAVN withdrawal from Cambodia. They also soon realized, just as the Khmer Rouge also realized, that the 16-Camps Campaign was a blessing in disguise. After all of the camps were razed, the CGDK population was relocated to camps inside Thailand. The KNPLF administered Site II, which was akin to a small city, populated by the civilians of the KPNLF, and the camp was protected by a long stretch of tank ditch to prevent any potential PAVN offensive.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_158"><sup>158</sup></xref> General Chavalit of the Thai army also made it clear that any PAVN offensive would be met by an all-out Thai assault. The soldiers of the KPNLF, however, had to leave their families in Site II and move to the KPNLAF headquarters at Klang Dong, a forested area reserved for the
<target target-type="page" id="page_89"/>sprawling KPNLAF&#x2019;s military bureaucracy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_159"><sup>159</sup></xref> The men could visit their families in Site II but could not bring any weapons into the camp.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge administered Site 8 and Site K while the FUNCINPEC controlled Site B and Ta Tum (also known as Green Hill). Those who were not part of any movement and wanted to go to a third country had to move to Kao-I-Dang, which was administered by the United Nations refugee body, the UNHCR, and was not under the influence of any Cambodian resistance group.</p>
<p>With safe haven secured, the ANS and the KPNLAF now implemented their guerrilla war plan in the interior of Cambodia, as well as building conventional forces for an eventual offensive after the PAVN withdrawal. The three ANS brigades had established two more brigades, all of which were later upgraded to divisions, and by 1989 the ANS had five divisions: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th Division.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_160"><sup>160</sup></xref> The ANS also had forces operating deep in the country, the most prominent of which was the 15th Brigade that operated in Kampong Thom province. Using the KPRA&#x2019;s unit as the base, the ANS had an equivalent of five brigades. In 1988, the KPNLAF redesignated its battalions as regiments, although the personnel remained the same.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_161"><sup>161</sup></xref> Some claimed that the KPNLAF general staff made this move so it could promote its officers to the same rank as those of the ANS who controlled the regiments, which were, in fact, battalion-size units by KPRA standards.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_162"><sup>162</sup></xref></p>
<p>Starting in 1987, the KPNLAF reorganized itself into conventional units in anticipation of the offensive that would follow the Vietnamese withdrawal. The 16-Camps Campaign saw the abolition of the three-zone system, and all of the forces were re-organized. The KPNLAF created &#x201C;military regions,&#x201D; planning, perhaps, for the eventual control of a liberated Cambodia.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_163"><sup>163</sup></xref> Needless to say, all of the military regions remained at the border even though they were supposed to control provinces throughout Cambodia. In early 1987, the KPNLAF reduced the number of military regions from nine to seven and then changed the name of the units to Operational Military Zone (OMZ).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_164"><sup>164</sup></xref> An OMZ controlled a number of regiments, each of which mustered around three hundred fighters. There was a disparity between the OMZs, with some, for example, OMZ4, controlling two regiments, while others, such as OMZ6, controlled four regiments.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_165"><sup>165</sup></xref> This disparity was the legacy of the small movements that decided to fuse together to form the KPNLAF. Accordingly, the movement that had large forces had developed into a large OMZ, and small movements could eventually control only the OMZs that had less fighters. Each OMZ was an equivalent of an augmented KPRA&#x2019;s regiment.</p>
<p>According to some estimates, OMZ1 had three regiments (111, 112, and 113) totaling about 500 men; OMZ2 had four regiments (212, 213, 214, and 216) totaling 400 men; OMZ3 had four regiments (311, 312, 313, and 314) totaling about 1,600 men; OMZ4 had three regiments (41, 42, and 43) and one intervention battalion totaling about 1,000 men; OMZ5
<target target-type="page" id="page_90"/>had four regiments (511, 512, 513, and 514) totaling 700 men; OMZ6 had four regiments (611, 612, 614, and 615) totaling less than 1,000 men; and OMZ7 had four regiments (711, 713, 714, and 715) totaling 800 men.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_166"><sup>166</sup></xref> Moreover, a Special Operational Military Zone was created and was put under the control of the KPNLAF General Staff Headquarters. It had two regiments. The 801st Special Regiment had an intervention battalion and an artillery unit totaling less than 500 men, while the 806th Regiment had about 600 men distributed in three battalions. The 801st, perhaps the most courageous of all, originated from a former Khmer Rouge unit, which may explain its battlefield prowess.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_167"><sup>167</sup></xref> The KPNLAF General Staff Headquarters also controlled several commando units (who sported red berets) totaling around 300 men. A final showdown with the KPRA, which we shall turn to in the next chapter, was inevitable.</p>

<title>The PAVN&#x2019;s Cambodian contingent: the Vietnamese Volunteer Army</title>
<p>The Vietnamese maintained a structure more or less similar to the PAVN units that operated during the Vietnam War. A typical division would have on average ten thousand men with organic armor and artillery support. When it came into Cambodia, however, the PAVN called itself the Viet namese Volunteer Army in order to justify its intervention. The Vietnamese and the PRK used the names &#x201C;PAVN&#x201D; and &#x201C;Vietnamese Volunteer Army&#x201D; interchangeably. But in this book, to avoid confusion resulting from an acronym overload, the Vietnamese army will be simply referred to as PAVN.</p>
<p>The PAVN fielded two types of divisions in Cambodia. The first type was the typical divisions, having one, two, or three-digit numerical designation. For a lack of better terms and for the sake of simplicity, this book shall call these units &#x201C;mobile divisions.&#x201D; The second type of divisions can be tenta tively called &#x201C;local-governance military expert group&#x201D; <italic>(qu&#x00E2;n su dia phucng nhu &#x0111;o&#x00E0;n),</italic> which was identified by a four-digit numerical designation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> This was a military formation the size of a division, but their task was exclusively nation-building.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_2"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
<p>These latter units never moved outside of the province like the mobile divisions, and they typically had a battalion at each district and a company at each village; the size of the garrisoned unit varied depending on the different size of the districts and villages. In Cambodia, unit 7701 stationed in Kampong Thom province (also responsible for Preah Vihear province), unit 7704 stationed in Battambang-Banteay Meanchey province, and unit 7705 stationed in Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey province.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_3"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>

<title>The Kampuchea People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Army (KPRA)</title>
<p>During one of the meetings in the negotiation rounds in 1990, Khieu Samphan from the Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge) faction told the press, &#x201C;We [Democratic Kampuchea] have shown our understanding to let
<target target-type="page" id="page_98"/>the &#x2018;Puppet&#x2019; [People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea] to join the SNC [Supreme National Council of Cambodia].&#x201D; Not wanting the insult to go unpunished, Premier Hun Sen of the People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea promptly replied, &#x201C;I am so &#x2018;thankful&#x2019; for the understanding from the &#x2018;Murderers.&#x2019; &#x201C;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_4"><sup>4</sup></xref> The exchange actually summed up the antagonism and hostility between the factions of the Cambodian Civil War very well.</p>
<p>When the Kampuchean People&#x2019;s Solidarity and National Salvation Armed Forces liberated Phnom Penh on 7 January 1979, the new state, the People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The state was controlled by the resurrected Kampuchea People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Party&#x2014;its official establishment date was set to be 1951&#x2014;and had an army, the Kampuchea People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Army (KPRA). The KPRA had three main echelons.</p>
<p>The first echelon was the mobile division, called the &#x201C;sharp troop&#x201D; (a transliteration from the Khmer term &#x201C;<italic>toap srouch</italic>&#x201D;). The KPRA General Staff Headquarters in Phnom Penh maintained control of these units. The second echelon was the territorial troops, controlled by &#x201C;Regions,&#x201D; which were later transformed into &#x201C;Military Regions&#x201D; (MR), of which there were five in 1989. The MR controlled several provincial military commands (PMC), which managed operations in their respective provinces. The PMCs were organized as conventional formations, but they did not have organic artillery or armor and fought primarily as infantry units. The MR controlled intervention units as well as armor units and heavy artillery. The third echelon of the KPRA was the paramilitary units consisting of office militias (protecting govern ment offices), fishing lot militias (in the Tonle Sap Lake area), the defense militias (protecting the key infrastructure such as railroad lines and bridges), the village militias, and the hamlet militias.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_5"><sup>5</sup></xref> An estimate of the total forces in 1987 is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4_1">Table 4.1</xref> (page 127).</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<label>4.2.1</label>
<title>Mobilization strategy and concept of operations</title>
<p>Following the communist tradition, there was a tendency of the party to control every aspect of military life. The Ministry of Homeland Defense controlled all military matters, while the General Staff Headquarters was in charge of operational matters. The general staff was under the ministry, and the chief of general staff concurrently held the position of first deputy minister of homeland defense. In a manner not different from the Khmer Rouge forces, the KPRA officer did not have formal ranks, and the officers were usually known by their positions, such as &#x201C;comrade battalion commander.&#x201D; The second communist influence was the role of the political officer or political commissar. In each unit, there is a position called &#x201C;political commander&#x201D; who was in charge of the political direction in the unit. Despite having the same rank as the operational commander, the political commander usually did not involve himself in operational matters, but he was the bearer of the party&#x2019;s message, maintained unit discipline, rallied the troops and the populations, and countered enemy infiltration.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_99"/>The KPRA functioned around a concept called &#x201C;<italic>pror-long pror-naing</italic>,&#x201D; which can literally be translated as &#x201C;friendly competition.&#x201D; In this concept, promotions and rewards were based on the friendly competitions among different units as well as within unit.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_6"><sup>6</sup></xref> The political commander and the commander of the higher unit were the record keepers. The friendly competition centered on three interrelated areas: fighting the enemy, building the unit, and political and ethical integrity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_7"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>
<p>Just like any other units, fighting the enemy either through ambushes, defense, deliberate attacks and rallying of the bystanders all counted in this category. Second, and related to rallying, the unit was expected to maintain its integrity, morale, as well as self-sufficiency through good rapport with the population. Third, within the unit itself the soldiers and officers were vetted by the political officer as to their personal characters and ethical principles, especially their conduct towards the local population. This concept did not only apply to the regular units but also the territorial troops as well as the militias forces.</p>
<p>Within the KPRA, in many instances of extraordinary individual heroism, the officer or soldier would receive the highest distinction of all, the &#x201C;hero&#x201D; (<italic>virak tchunn</italic>) designation. Throughout the war, many people would receive this distinction, including many militia troops who outnumbered the award recipients from the conventional units. In expectation of the offensive to come from the resistance, the KPRA published in the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> newspaper the names of ten soldiers who had received the highest distinction, the &#x201C;Hero medal.&#x201D; At least five of them came from the militias, and most eventually switched service to the conventional divisions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_8"><sup>8</sup></xref> In many cases, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> newspaper struggled with insufficient means to produce comic strip images to recount the episodes that led these officers to receive the hero designation.</p>
<p>As a former KPRA officer noted, after the Khmer Rouge regime, everyone had almost nothing in their possession, and as a result, they worried less about financial rewards, unlike the non-communist factions of the CGDK.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_9"><sup>9</sup></xref> Moreover, the KPRA officers were faced with an existential threat&#x2014;the Khmer Rouge&#x2014;and that was a great motivation for them to fight. One of the reasons why the PRK could succeed in building a strong state was its ability to blend the anti-Khmer Rouge propaganda with the friendly competition concept to build a strong army, at least in the early period of the war.</p>

<title>The armed propaganda units and the dual-duty companies</title>
<p>The party&#x2019;s tendency to assume control of everything to the lowest organizational level possible fits perfectly with the concept of &#x201C;People&#x2019;s War,&#x201D; which calls for general mobilization of the population. The KPRA taught the soldiers, officers, and political cadres, the concept of 5-in-1 villager: &#x201C;a villager is a soldier, a policeman, a propagandist, a producer, and an
<target target-type="page" id="page_100"/>intelligence agent.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_10"><sup>10</sup></xref> The KPRA&#x2019;s policy also integrated all military and paramilitary forces under one umbrella.</p>
<p>With the support of Vietnamese local-governance military expert groups, around 1980, the central committee of the Kampuchea People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Party sent small teams called the &#x201C;armed propaganda units,&#x201D; a direct copy of the Viet Minh&#x2019;s unit by the same name, to each province to build similar teams. The main mission was to spread the party&#x2019;s propaganda as well as building local government structure at the village level and above. The Vietnamese mobile divisions also assisted the territorial troops of the KPRA in launching many operations (usually identified with the prefix &#x201C;C&#x201D; such as C80 in Siem Reap province) to extend the PRK&#x2019;s influence beyond the provincial capital. They organized elections in order to build the local governments. The armed propaganda units then recruited people to defend the hamlets and villages.</p>
<p>Between 1984 and 1985, the armed propaganda units recruited enough people to upgrade themselves into larger units. Thus, the armed propaganda units became the &#x201C;dual-duty companies&#x201D; (in Khmer, &#x201C;<italic>koor pi pheara-kej&#x201D;</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_11"><sup>11</sup></xref> As the name implied, the latter was set up as a company at the district level and conducted two main missions: fighting and spreading propaganda; in essence, the reproduction and augmentation of the armed propaganda units.</p>
<p>A former KPRA officer explained the choice: at the hamlet and village level, the forces were paramilitary in nature and therefore could not be expected to sustain long-term operations, which required the ability to fight during their mission of spreading the propaganda.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_12"><sup>12</sup></xref> At the province, however, the KPRA had battalions, which were too cumbersome to move to different places. Consequently, the district&#x2019;s company was a good compromise. The company could fight as a conventional unit, yet it was small enough to move around for its propaganda missions. In most cases, a district would have had more than one company because one of them was expected to be a dual-duty company. In cases where the district population could not support more than one company, one of the platoons in that company would become the dual-duty platoon.</p>
<p>By continuing to adhere to the &#x201C;5-in-1 villager&#x201D; slogan (a villager is a soldier, a policeman, a propagandist, a producer, and an intelligence agent), the dual-duty companies continued to sustain their propaganda and recruited more people to serve in the provincial battalions. As soon as a battalion was raised, the province was expected to contribute it to the mobile divisions as required. The mobile divisions received most of their reinforcements from the PMCs this way, as a conscription law did not exist until 1988. The PMCs contributed a lot of troops to the mobile divisions but still retained a far more substantial force in its order of battle. Provinces in the eastern part of the country such as Kampong Cham, Svay Rieng, and Prey Veng had more people but less Khmer Rouge threat, and in 1989 these provinces contributed many battalions and regiments to the western provinces.</p>

<label>4.2.3</label>
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_101"/>Indoctrination</title>
<p>Following the People&#x2019;s War model in the communist tradition, the KPRA&#x2019;s penchant towards indoctrination was very strong. Indoctrination of the KPRA was applied at three main levels. The first level was the special program prepared by the central committee of the Kampuchea People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Party for the newly appointed commanders. The program was not regular in that it depended on the number of new commanders who would assume responsibility.</p>
<p>The second level of indoctrination was embedded with the specialized schools for the armed forces. The Ministry of Homeland Defense maintained a series of specialized schools such as infantry, artillery, armor, etc. Within each school, there was always a special section for the political study. The <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> often made references to this kind of indoctrination. The existence of such a course was first recorded in the first issue of the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> on October 1979 (Phnom Penh was liberated in January 1979).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_13"><sup>13</sup></xref> But the newspaper mentioned that the October course was already a second session and was taught to officers in the General Staff Headquarters, division commanders, provincial military commanders, and battalion commanders.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_14"><sup>14</sup></xref> The course was held at the Ministry of Homeland Defense&#x2019;s infantry school.</p>
<p>The third level of indoctrination occurred at the local level. In the preceding section, we have seen the development of the dual-duty com panies, which were later upgraded into battalions and regiments. The units&#x2019; main role was propaganda, among itself and the people. In addition to these units, each KPRA unit also had a position called &#x201C;political commander.&#x201D; The political commander did not involve himself in the operational matters and only dealt with political affairs such as indoctrination and morale building.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_15"><sup>15</sup></xref> Because indoctrination was his only job, one can certainly expect the political commander to carry out his indoctrination program on a regular basis.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_16"><sup>16</sup></xref> That is what all bureaucrats who are concerned with maintaining their relevance would do.</p>
<p>Therefore, because of this institution of the &#x201C;political commander,&#x201D; one can expect indoctrination to occur systematically and on a regular basis. The official history of the Siem Reap provincial military command mentioned that a political commander existed at the company level while the platoon had a &#x201C;political assistant.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_17"><sup>17</sup></xref> Official history of the Battambang-Banteay Meanchey provincial military command corroborated this view.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_18"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<label>4.2.3.1</label>
<title>Indoctrination in action</title>
<p>There are indeed two major challenges regarding the study of political programs, namely the actual implementation of the political program (and indoctrination) and issues about effectiveness. First of all, while the programs described in the preceding section were the largest indoctrination programs that the KPRA had conducted, a question arises as to whether or
<target target-type="page" id="page_102"/>not such programs were carried out by units in the field, or by the officers once they left the school. Unfortunately, there are no comprehensive statistics available regarding this issue. In fact, even the books by Western scholars, such as Slocomb&#x2019;s <italic>The People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea</italic>, did not include even anecdotes concerning the propaganda efforts of the KPRA at the local level. However, such information does exist in the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> newspaper, although perhaps due to the language barrier, this information has never been examined.</p>
<p>This book will therefore examine the primary data available in the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> newspaper. Instead of examining all articles, which would generate many similar stories and data, this book will analyze model articles in the newspaper during three crucial periods: 1980, 1985, and 1989. In 1980, the KPRA had just begun to liberate the country from the Pol Pot regime, and its main mission was popular mobilization, i.e. indoctrination, fighting the enemy, and saving the people from hunger.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_19"><sup>19</sup></xref> Thus, 1980 is a test as to whether the army had really performed these non-military missions of indoctrination and rescuing the people from hunger. In 1985 the PAVN had just launched the 16-Camps Campaign, which pushed major CGDK&#x2019;s units into Thailand. This period is marked by a relative increase in the conventional military operations, which could be expected to eclipse the political works of the KPRA. Thus, this is a second test as to whether the KPRA remained faithful to its political missions at a time when the conventional military operations were more demanding. Lastly, the year 1989 (and 1990 and 1991) was the final year of the PRK, and the question is whether the PRK had achieved anything from its political work throughout the years in preparation for the resistance onslaught.</p>
<p>The next question is the effectiveness question. How do we know if those propaganda and indoctrination programs worked? How do we know if the population changed its mind? And if so, do we know why the population changed its mind? These &#x201C;effectiveness&#x201D; questions are about assessing people&#x2019;s opinions. And even in recent events where the data is available, determining the dynamic of people&#x2019;s opinion is a difficult issue. Thus, the major challenge that faces this book is to answer these questions from the time when data is scarce, if not unavailable altogether.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> newspaper did make assessments of political programs, and these provide many clues as to the effectiveness of the political approach to fighting a People&#x2019;s War. In the subsequent section, this book will attempt to describe simultaneously both what the KPRA achieved in terms of indoctrination, and also the possible results of these achievements. Before we analyze the data, one has to bear in mind that the information came from the KPRA&#x2019;s official newspaper, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army.</italic> This book does not pretend that there was no propaganda in the stories. Yet, as it was the best evidence available on political indoctrination, this book will present the data as is and will appraise it at the end of the section.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_103"/>1980: the military governed</title>
<p>In 1980 Cambodian society was just slowly emerging from genocide and famine on a large scale. As evidenced by countless articles in the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> newspaper, the KPRA then was ordered to help the people whenever it could, in addition to pure military tasks. The military was also in charge of building and protecting the local authority in places where, in 1980, such structures were not in existence due to the fact that the Khmer Rouge had destroyed them when it was in power from 1975 to 1979.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_20"><sup>20</sup></xref> Election did occur, even though there was no opposition to the PRK&#x2019;s candidates who would run against each other.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_21"><sup>21</sup></xref> The KPRA&#x2019;s official unit history noted that in many rural villages, election was not possible due to the Khmer Rouge threat and the KPRA and the PAVN had to launch low-intensity operations to maintain security for the election to occur.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_22"><sup>22</sup></xref> According to Slocomb, the local officials were people indigenous to the villages and did not necessarily have any relations to the Vietnamese or connections with officials in Phnom Penh.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_23"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
<p>In one particular village north of the Pursat provincial capital, for example, the army claimed that improved security had allowed more people to move into the villages, and that the population increased from 23 to 363 households in less than one year.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_24"><sup>24</sup></xref> Since July 1979, each soldier in almost every unit nationwide had allocated at least one kilogram of rice out of his or her individual allowance (approximately 5 percent of the total individual allowance) to give to the local population every month.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_25"><sup>25</sup></xref> In some places such as Saeb village in Kampong Trolach district (Kampong Chhnang province), the 3rd Company of the 6th Battalion of the KPRA had spent fifteen days to help the people with agricultural work.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_26"><sup>26</sup></xref> Similarly, the 19th Battalion in Kampong Thom helped the people with the harvest as well as sharing its food with the people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_27"><sup>27</sup></xref> The unit also ordered its soldiers to maintain good relations with the local government and the militias.</p>
<p>In some cases, the description was meticulous. For example, the 33rd Battalion in Kampong Cham province reported that it had helped the people with the harvest, and also with the repair of people&#x2019;s houses.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_28"><sup>28</sup></xref> The <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> reported that even a conventional unit, such as the 4th Division, had shared its food with approximately four thousand people who lived within the unit&#x2019;s area of operations.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_29"><sup>29</sup></xref> Similarly, the newspaper reported that Takeo PMC had helped the people in the cultivation and harvest of around one hundred hectares of land, while maintaining its conventional operations against the enemy and enhancing indoctrination.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_30"><sup>30</sup></xref> The Ministry of Homeland Defense bestowed upon the PMC many medals for such achievements.</p>
<p>The participation of conventional units in these non-military tasks was not strange. The &#x201C;E&#x201D; armored unit shared with the people 1,300 kilograms of the vegetable that it had grown in the first nine months of 1980, while also having repaired nineteen of the people&#x2019;s houses, and constructed 8,000 meters of road for the community.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_31"><sup>31</sup></xref> The 2nd Battalion in Kampong Speu
<target target-type="page" id="page_104"/>and the 18th Battalion in Battambang both allocated rice for poor people as well as helping them with the harvest of their crops without charging them any money.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_32"><sup>32</sup></xref> As division &#x201C;S&#x201D; (a code name that based on the description, might have meant the 4th Division) moved from Kampong Chhnang to the border between Battambang and Pursat, it had performed three main tasks: rice allocation for poor people, assistance for the people&#x2019;s agricultural work, and conducting indoctrination lessons for the local militias.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_33"><sup>33</sup></xref> The 7th and 9th Battalions of the 1st Brigade (which later became the 196th Division) had helped to harvest twenty hectares of the people&#x2019;s land in November, and allocated two hundred and fifty kilograms of rice to one hundred poor families who could not support themselves.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_34"><sup>34</sup></xref> After this assistance, the units also conducted indoctrination sessions.</p>
<p>These are summaries of what the KPRA units did in terms of popular mobilization in 1980. Later in the year, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> did not give any specific data on the effectiveness of these actions, but it did note that soldier recruitment surpassed the targets in Kampong Speu, Koh Kong, and Kampong Thom. The newspaper attributed these successes, based on the interviews with the local military units, to political programs and popular mobilization.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_35"><sup>35</sup></xref></p>
<p>Also in 1980, the KPRA began to implement an amnesty program for the defectors. The first instance of such action was mentioned when the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> described the activities of the 7th Battalion, which also included monthly political works within the unit, lectures, self-criticism sessions, and the lessons-learned sessions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_36"><sup>36</sup></xref> But the unit also conducted works related to what was known as the &#x201C;Lost,&#x201D; i.e. those who have lost their way and joined the CGDK.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_37"><sup>37</sup></xref> The political works, according to the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic>, allowed the unit to convince an unspecified number of the &#x201C;Lost&#x201D; to return to live in society and the reception of the Lost was conducted in a formal ceremony.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_38"><sup>38</sup></xref> In 1980, the policy regarding the &#x201C;Lost&#x201D; was in its infancy, but during 1984 and 1985, this policy became a major political strategy.</p>
<p>The <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> newspaper frequently ran individual stories of defectors, the &#x201C;Lost&#x2019;s story.&#x201D; These articles typically gave a brief version of the defector&#x2019;s biography and then recounted how he or she joined the resistance groups, and then what prompted him or her to return. What was special when the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> used the term &#x201C;Lost,&#x201D; was the meaning that these people had defected without a fight. Sometimes, such defections occurred right at the end of the indoctrination sessions. Sometimes, it was their families who had joined the indoctrination lessons and then convinced the &#x201C;Lost&#x201D; to return from the resistance&#x2019;s jungle bases. The <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> distinguished this group from those who &#x201C;surrendered on the battlefield,&#x201D; meaning post-battle defection.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_39"><sup>39</sup></xref> This book does not count such post-battle defections, because such behavior might have been influenced by the outcome of the battle, rather than the result of propaganda. Only the defectors in the &#x201C;Lost&#x201D; category will give a better measurement of the effects of propaganda and indoctrination.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_105"/>1985: war on the fringes, indoctrination in the interior</title>
<p>The &#x201C;Lost&#x201D; program maintained its relevance well into 1985. One article, in particular, recounted a curious chain of events that is significant from the standpoint of this book. In March 1985, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> ran an article about the defection of two former resistance fighters named Keth Chhum and Buth Ven.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_40"><sup>40</sup></xref> Both joined the resistance because of three CGDK&#x2019;s propaganda messages: Vietnamese invasion, Vietnamese would kill all Cambodians who did not run away, and there was treasure (i.e. materialistic attraction) in the jungle.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_41"><sup>41</sup></xref> When they joined, however, there was a severe lack of food, and the resistance seemed to be more interested in looting than in achieving any higher ideological goal. Both men cited these problems as the reasons why they defected.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_42"><sup>42</sup></xref></p>
<p>What is perhaps more interesting is how the article explained the causal effects of propaganda. The article started by describing the PRK&#x2019;s propaganda messages, which included three things: good people-army relations, preventing Pol Pot from returning to power, and the indoctrination of the &#x201C;Marxist-Leninist ideology.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_43"><sup>43</sup></xref> However, when the same article explained why the two men defected to the KPRA, the two men cited the uneasiness with &#x201C;Pol Pot&#x2019;s soldiers,&#x201D; KPRA&#x2019;s good conduct towards the people, and the fact that previous defectors were not harmed or even arrested by the KPRA.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_44"><sup>44</sup></xref> Curiously, the indoctrination of the Marxist-Leninist ideology, which was a significant ideological message, was not counted among the reasons why the two men defected. The anti-Pol Pot ideology and the good people&#x2013;army relations seemed to be the only reasons for defection. Stories like this are prone to manipulation and biases. However, this discrepancy might actually suggest that the interview with the two men was genuine and that the staff somehow failed to fabricate the story to include the MarxistLeninist ideology indoctrination in the list of effective propaganda tools. Many other stories in the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> bear resemblance to this story.</p>
<p>Another of the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> articles in 1985 recounted a story of a man who had conducted business with the resistance guerrillas and later joined them out of fear of revenge from the KPRA.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_45"><sup>45</sup></xref> However, the man decided to defect when he learned about the KPRA&#x2019;s leniency towards the defectors as well as hearing the word &#x201C;Pol Pot&#x201D; in his first meeting with the guerrillas: these guerillas turned out to be the Khmer Rouge (which implied that his fear of Pol Pot led him to defect).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_46"><sup>46</sup></xref> Similarly, in another defector&#x2019;s article, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> reported on the relationship between the wife and the husband as the reason for defection.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_47"><sup>47</sup></xref> In that story, the husband decided to defect because the conditions of life in the resistance&#x2019;s jungle camp were bad while he was separated from his wife and newborn baby who lived in the village under PRK&#x2019;s control.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_48"><sup>48</sup></xref> In this case, it seems the propaganda focused more on things that the individuals could relate to, rather than some abstract ideology such as the Marxist-Leninist ideology.</p>
<p>The amnesty program was not the only program that flourished in 1985. The PRK also expanded its political indoctrination programs. At the national
<target target-type="page" id="page_106"/>level, in order to make sure that the anti-Pol Pot propaganda persisted in people&#x2019;s minds and the collective memory, the PRK had organized an annual event to condemn the Khmer Rouge regime and the genocide that occurred during that time. The event was held annually on 20 May, the anniversary of the establishment of the &#x201C;cooperatives&#x201D; by the Khmer Rouge regime (20 May 1976), commonly understood to be the main cause of famine and mass killing.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_49"><sup>49</sup></xref> The first time such an event was described in meticulous detail was in a <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> article in May 1985.</p>
<p>The event was called &#x201C;<italic>Ti Vea Jorng Kom Heung</italic>&#x201D; or &#x201C;Vengeful Remembrance Day,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Day of Hatred,&#x201D; or more literally, &#x201C;The Day to Remain Tied to Hatred,&#x201D; during which time, the state officials prepared religious ceremonies, making political speeches and more importantly the participants recounted their stories under the Khmer Rouge regime.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_50"><sup>50</sup></xref> The story-telling by the victims and their relatives eventually led other participants to remember their relatives and family members who were killed during the Khmer Rouge regime, which inevitably brought about a strong emotional reaction. Then the state would explain that the people&#x2019;s struggle was required to prevent the return of the genocidal Pol Pot regime.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_51"><sup>51</sup></xref> The speech of the officials typically called the people to join the KPRA in preventing the return of the Khmer Rouge.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_52"><sup>52</sup></xref></p>
<p>The PRK dictated that the event must be held at all levels, down to the hamlets and the best places to conduct the event should be the former Khmer Rouge prisons, sites of the mass graves, or former collective kitchen halls (which symbolized the cooperatives).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_53"><sup>53</sup></xref> During the event, the people not only brought propaganda placards but also took the liberty to arm themselves with scythes, big knives, axes, or clubs to express their anger.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_54"><sup>54</sup></xref> In Phnom Penh, the major sites that the event was typically held were the Toul Sleng Genocidal Museum (former S-21 prison) and the Choeung Ek memorial, which was a former mass grave site.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_55"><sup>55</sup></xref></p>
<p>The <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> article that appeared on 23 May 1985 was quite comprehensive in its explanation of the relationship between political messages and the struggle that was required from the people. The article listed interviews with people from various social classes such as monks, intellectuals, factory workers, soldiers, and minority groups.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_56"><sup>56</sup></xref> In all of these short interviews, there is a common theme, namely that the reason why people followed and served the state (PRK) was the hatred of the Khmer Rouge, the fear of its return, and the desire to avenge loved ones who had died under the Khmer Rouge regime.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_57"><sup>57</sup></xref> Unlike opinion columns that always alluded to the Marxist-Leninist ideology as the cause for the struggle against the Khmer Rouge (considered to be &#x201C;fake revolutionaries&#x201D;), the interviews listed in the 23 May article never mentioned this abstract aspect, but rather described the emotional responses of the interviewees: fear, revenge, and hatred.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_58"><sup>58</sup></xref></p>
<p>Curiously, even though the event was dropped from the list of national official events after the new government came to power in 1993 (as a result
<target target-type="page" id="page_107"/>of the UN-sponsored election), today people still gather in the thousands to organize religious ceremonies for the victims of the Khmer Rouge regime.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_59"><sup>59</sup></xref> However, the gathering places are restricted to mainly the Toul Sleng Genocidal Museum and the Choeung Ek Memorial, which are considered national landmarks.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_60"><sup>60</sup></xref></p>
<p>At the local level, all types of military units were expected to conduct internal indoctrination as well as popular indoctrination. Previously, the soldiers came to the political schools and then taught what they had learned to other soldiers or the people. To try to advance this effort one step further, in April 1985, the KPRA began to train the first batch of political instructors, numbering a total of one hundred and six instructors, and these political instructors were then assigned to various units nationwide.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_61"><sup>61</sup></xref> Regardless, the political indoctrination program continued with or without instructors. Furthermore, just like the propaganda at the local level, the propaganda lessons for the local units have always contained the sessions about using the prevention of the return of the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot as the reasons why people should join the KPRA as well as maintaining good relations with the people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_62"><sup>62</sup></xref></p>
<p>In addition to political indoctrination, the army continued undertaking social works and civic actions in order to maintain good relations with the people. What is revealed in the 1980 articles of the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic>, was an army that saved the people from hunger and famine. Rice allocation and sharing was a norm. In 1985, however, the people seemed to have become self-sufficient because the PRK no longer shared its rice with the people but rather encouraged the people to sell rice surpluses to the state. Rice surpluses are an indication that perhaps the people&#x2019;s living standards had improved from 1980 to 1985. Many articles (examined below) praised the people for selling rice to the state, thereby denying those resources to the resistance. Indoctrination, civic actions, and fighting the enemy had to go hand in hand, at least based on the examination of the reports in the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic>. It seems that all units had maintained these credos even though the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> started to increasingly provide news about conventional battles on the Cambodian-Thai border.</p>
<p>This book observes that in addition to its coverage of military matters, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> assessed the effectiveness of political activities by reporting on four metrics: the number of indoctrination sessions, the number of people attending, the number of the defectors in the &#x201C;Lost&#x201D; category, and the number of people who volunteered to serve in the army.</p>
<p>In 1984, Kampong Thom PMC conducted 799 indoctrination sessions and 181,503 people participated in these sessions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_63"><sup>63</sup></xref> Although the scale of these sessions remained comparatively small, the PMC noted that they motivated people to help the KPRA in identifying the resistance&#x2019;s under ground guerrilla networks, and in some cases led the KPRA units to attack resistance&#x2019;s clandestine bases.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_64"><sup>64</sup></xref> In December 1984, farmers in Kratie province sold three hundred and thirty-seven tons of rice surpluses to the state, in accordance
<target target-type="page" id="page_108"/>with the slogan &#x201C;selling rice to the state is loving the nation.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_65"><sup>65</sup></xref> The article also noted that the army and local officials helped with the rice cultivation and harvest at no charge to the farmers, allowing the farmers to sell their surplus to the state, rather than to the resistance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_66"><sup>66</sup></xref> Until February 1985, Kratie had sold a total of 2,150 tons of rice surplus to the state, while Battambang had sold 6,000 tons.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_67"><sup>67</sup></xref></p>
<p>The trading relations between the people and the army were even closer in other provinces such as Pursat. In 1984, the province reported that the PMC had sold 35 pigs per month to the people, while the people sold 2,245 tons of rice surplus and 551 pigs to the state in the same year.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_68"><sup>68</sup></xref> During this trade, the army also conducted 188 indoctrination lessons with 10,638 people participating, and as a result of this, a total of 188 of the resistance&#x2019;s underground agents decided to defect after participating in these sessions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_69"><sup>69</sup></xref></p>
<p>In other cases, the indoctrination sessions did not necessarily accompany the commercial relations between the army and the people. Due to the dual nature of the KPRA duties, the indoctrination, social works, and combat planning went hand in hand. The <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> sometimes described an operation where the militias had conducted social work in the morning (repairing people&#x2019;s houses) and then planned military operations in the afternoon, after receiving tips from the local population.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_70"><sup>70</sup></xref> On another occasion, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> described an all-female company of a district&#x2019;s military in Svay Rieng province, which, after successful operations against a Khmer Rouge infiltration team, had returned to the district and performed the following tasks: participated in a fifteen-day indoctrination session, spent five days giving political lectures to the people, and helped the people with harvesting.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_71"><sup>71</sup></xref></p>
<p>During the first two months of 1985, the Bakan district&#x2019;s military of Pursat PMC taught a twenty-six-lesson course to its soldiers, including eleven days of political studies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_72"><sup>72</sup></xref> The unit also ran fifty-six indoctrination sessions in the last trimester of 1984, reaching 4,758 people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_73"><sup>73</sup></xref> The unit also participated in indoctrination sessions run by the local officials fourteen times, including 115 participants, and the target audience of these indoctrination sessions was the families of men who had joined the resistance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_74"><sup>74</sup></xref> While the guerrillas stayed outside of the village, their relatives typically stayed in the village. As a result, the propaganda was aimed at getting these relatives to convince the guerrillas to defect. The <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> noted that these sessions were effective in that they could attract 196 defectors and 159 new recruits in the same period.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_75"><sup>75</sup></xref> Perhaps as an assurance to those who had left the resistance, the Bakan district&#x2019;s military also constructed 9,200 meters of &#x201C;strategic fences&#x201D; and erected 4,000 meters of trenches in various villages.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_76"><sup>76</sup></xref></p>
<p>In the first trimester of 1985, Kampong Speu PMC conducted various indoctrination sessions for 1,100 people, after which 164 underground guerrillas decided to defect to the KPRA.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_77"><sup>77</sup></xref> In the same period, Kampong Thom province attracted 61 defectors, including a commander of the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s 103rd Intelligence Battalion, and the PMC subsequently received
<target target-type="page" id="page_109"/>234 defectors.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_78"><sup>78</sup></xref> In late April 1985, the Kampong Speu, Kampong Chhnang, Kampot, Pursat, Takeo, and Kandal PMCs had conducted indoctrination sessions, which were attended by a total of 287,263 people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_79"><sup>79</sup></xref> Among them, the main targets of the indoctrination sessions were the relatives and families of the guerrillas, amounting to 325 families.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_80"><sup>80</sup></xref> In other words, even though the KPRA knew whose family members were in the resistance, they decided to avoid violence and focused instead on propaganda efforts.</p>
<p>The 5th Company of a Kampong Som district&#x2019;s military also conducted 5,634 indoctrination sessions and helped build villages (building houses, repairing houses, building roads, and assisting with the harvest).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_81"><sup>81</sup></xref> As a result of these actions, the company claimed that 764 people volunteered to serve along the Cambodian-Thai border, and the local people also donated the money to build a barrack for the company.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_82"><sup>82</sup></xref> The Svay Rieng PMC, in the first six months of 1985, conducted indoctrination sessions for 10,479 soldiers and 77,935 civilians in addition to 17 cultural performances, which drew 199,258 attendants.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_83"><sup>83</sup></xref> The PMC also helped the people harvest their crops over 1,124 hectares and demined 88 hectares to transfer these lands to civilian ownership at no charge.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_84"><sup>84</sup></xref> The article also mentioned that the Svay Rieng PMC had given language classes to illiterate people in order to save them from the &#x201C;illiteracy disaster.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_85"><sup>85</sup></xref> The PMC concluded that these measures were very effective because it was able to recruit 1,709 to serve in its army, attracting 110 defectors as well as detaining, based on local informants, a total of 217 strangers who wandered into the province.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_86"><sup>86</sup></xref></p>
<p>Krobav village in Prey Veng province sold 232 tons of rice to the state in the first six months of 1985.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_87"><sup>87</sup></xref> In the same period, the PMC attracted 1,141 defectors and recruited 150 militiamen province-wide.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_88"><sup>88</sup></xref> These were not unique cases, however. The official state newspaper <ITALIC>SPK</ITALIC> reported that in August and September of 1985, a total of 53 defectors had decided to surrender to the Kampong Chhnang PMC, including one company commander and one battalion commander.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_89"><sup>89</sup></xref></p>
<p>During major events such as the party&#x2019;s congress, the military units were also encouraged to hold celebrations to involve the people. The year 1985 was the party&#x2019;s fifth congress and the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> published many articles about units acting in celebration of the event. In October, the 1st Company of Sutra Nikum district&#x2019;s military (Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey province) helped the people harvest crops from twenty-five hectares, repaired two houses and dug two wells.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_90"><sup>90</sup></xref> The company also conducted twenty-five indoctrination sessions for 2,450 people, as well as indoctrination sessions for its own soldiers (500 participants).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_91"><sup>91</sup></xref> Out of a total of eighteen training sessions, eight were technical military training, five were political training, and the other five were lesson-learned sessions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_92"><sup>92</sup></xref> In Kampong Thom, the PMC organized internal indoctrination sessions in celebration of the party&#x2019;s fifth congress.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_93"><sup>93</sup></xref> After the sessions, the soldiers dispersed to different villages to help the people with the harvest, to help repair irrigation works, build roads, and recruit people into the militias.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_94"><sup>94</sup></xref></p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_110"/>Indoctrination was also the duty of the militias. One special characteristic of the KPRA was its dependence on the local militias and the maintenance of cooperation between the conventional units and the militias. The <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> frequently described the welfare policy towards the militias and considered this as the main reason for success. In a village called Ta Tches in Kampong Chhnang, the militias said they served because of their fear that the Khmer Rouge might return, but at the same time, they also received many benefits such as pensions and land distribution.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_95"><sup>95</sup></xref> Their main task was to help the people build and repair houses, and then the people would return the favor by providing intelligence to the militias regarding the guerrilla infiltration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_96"><sup>96</sup></xref> In the &#x201C;L&#x201D; village (code name) in Kampong Chhnang province, the rate of enemy infiltration was very low because the militias frequently intercepted guerrilla movements.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_97"><sup>97</sup></xref> Village &#x201C;L&#x201D; was also among a few villages that had sold the highest amount of rice surplus to the state.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_98"><sup>98</sup></xref> According to the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic>, each militia family received two and a half hectares of land (approximately six acres) to cultivate and an allocation of three hundred kilograms of palm sugar in 1984.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_99"><sup>99</sup></xref></p>
<p>In some cases, the effectiveness of the indoctrination program and the policy of close relations with the people extended beyond mere rice-selling schemes and participation in the armed forces. In many instances, the KPRA&#x2019;s political programs directly translated into battlefield success. One article in the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> described a battle where militiamen in a village fought against a two hundred-strong Khmer Rouge battalion.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_100"><sup>100</sup></xref> Village militias in 1985 could typically muster only one platoon, which consisted of no more than fifty fighters. In March 1985, Prey Svay village in Moung Roeussey district, Battambang province, was attacked by a Khmer Rouge battalion (around two hundred fighters) but the militiamen held strong and defeated the Khmer Rouge attack.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_101"><sup>101</sup></xref> When interviewed by the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic>, the militiamen said that the reason they joined the militias was because of both their hatred and fear of the Khmer Rouge and because the Khmer Rouge had killed their relatives and families.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_102"><sup>102</sup></xref> During their patrols, these militiamen had often intercepted the Khmer Rouge infiltration. Perhaps as revenge, the Khmer Rouge encircled the village, but the militias&#x2019; familiarity with the terrain and their determination allowed them to defend the village long enough for the district&#x2019;s military to intervene and relieve the siege.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_103"><sup>103</sup></xref></p>
<p>In April 1985, the 1st Company of the Chongkal district in the Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey province had received high distinction from the Ministry of Homeland Defense for the highest rate of successful small operations that denied infiltration by the guerillas into its operational area.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_104"><sup>104</sup></xref> The unit cited its close relations with the people as the key to success: liberating the people and helping to build the village.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_105"><sup>105</sup></xref></p>
<p>In some provinces such as the Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey province, which was one of the hubs of the resistance&#x2019;s activities, the militias were instrumental in hindering fierce attacks. The Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey
<target target-type="page" id="page_111"/>province was home to the PAVN&#x2019;s Front 479, which later gave birth to the KPRA&#x2019;s Region 4 and Military Region 4 (MR4). The province, therefore, had to support the 286th Division, which operated in the province&#x2019;s area of operation. To do this, the Siem Reap Provincial Military Command (PMC) had to secure the road at the Kulen mountain pass, which it did successfully. The <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> considered the local militias to be the key to this success. In one village called Sangke Leak, the militia platoon was effective in intercepting the guerrilla&#x2019;s infiltration and protecting the mountain pass, thus allowing constant resupply of the 286th Division.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_106"><sup>106</sup></xref> In an interview with the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic>, the militias described the good relations between the military unit and the people as being the key to success.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_107"><sup>107</sup></xref></p>
<p>Later in the year, the number of attacks on militia platoons by the Khmer Rouge began to rise and in November 1985, the PMC decided to dispatch one of its battalions, the 23rd Battalion to help the militias defending the pass.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_108"><sup>108</sup></xref> This addition only increased the number of soldiers defending the mountain pass while the tactics remained unchanged. What the 23rd Battalion did when they arrived was essentially the same as what the village militias had done: indoctrination, strengthening local militias, and helping the local people whenever possible.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_109"><sup>109</sup></xref></p>
<p>In Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey province, there was an increase in guerrilla attacks in late 1985. This was probably the reason why a battalion needed to be dispatched to help the militias in the Kulen pass. While the units of militias were strong, their small number meant that there was a limit as to what they could achieve. Even the bravest militias could run out of ammunition and be overwhelmed. What is significant in this case, however, is the close cooperation between the militias and the conventional battalion from the PMC.</p>
<p>In another case in the same province, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> reported that the 20th Battalion of the Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey PMC that had been dispatched to Pouk district a month earlier, had fended off an attack by a regiment-size enemy unit.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_110"><sup>110</sup></xref> The newspaper attributed this success to the indoctrination works that the battalion had conducted which allowed them to build close relations with the people, a theme that has now become all too familiar.</p>
<p>Sometimes the people-army bond was manifested by the people&#x2019;s self-mobilization to help the army. Earlier, we have seen a case where the people built a barrack for the district&#x2019;s military.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_111"><sup>111</sup></xref> The <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> cited a case in Svay Rieng province where the army had helped the people in harvesting the crop as well as allocating their rice allowance to help the people in 1980 and in 1985.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_112"><sup>112</sup></xref> This enabled the people to become self-sufficient enough to return the favor by building an office for the border guard.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_113"><sup>113</sup></xref></p>
<p>Another important metric for success used by the KPRA was the number of defectors in the &#x201C;Lost&#x201D; category. Many military organizations have a tendency to use body counts as one metric of success, but the KPRA also seemed to pay attention to the defectors. While the program had existed
<target target-type="page" id="page_112"/>since 1980, it was only in 1984 and 1985 that the program began to produce notable results. In 1984, the Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey PMC had killed 337 guerrillas, wounded 302 others, and brought in 302 defectors.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_114"><sup>114</sup></xref> These operations were still linked with the support from the people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_115"><sup>115</sup></xref> In some cases, the causal link was direct. In a district in Svay Rieng province, the district&#x2019;s military had helped the people in the harvest of crops, had repaired roads, had repaired people&#x2019;s houses, and had built a hospital to provide medical care for the people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_116"><sup>116</sup></xref> The district noted that these actions were rewarded in the first six months of 1985, by the contribution of 212 soldiers to the KPRA, of which 52 volunteered to go and serve along the Cambodian-Thai border.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_117"><sup>117</sup></xref></p>
<p>Kampong Thom province used Kampong Svay district as an example of good political works, especially in attracting the defectors. The district&#x2019;s dual-duty company and militias received land allocation from the state, and their job was to provide indoctrination lessons, help the people harvest crops, and undertake social works such as repairing people&#x2019;s houses or digging wells.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_118"><sup>118</sup></xref> The article cited these factors as being a morale-booster for the units.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_119"><sup>119</sup></xref> The district&#x2019;s military unit, the 4th Company, also conducted internal indoctrination training. Out of the eighty-four days allocated for training in 1984, twenty-three days were political sessions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_120"><sup>120</sup></xref> The Kampong Thom PMC considered this unit to be the most exemplary unit, because it attracted 2,117 defectors in the period between October 1984 and March 1985.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_121"><sup>121</sup></xref></p>
<p>Takeo PMC boasted that it had successfully completed three major tasks: fighting the enemy and attracting defectors, completing social work (assisting the people with harvesting rice and repairing houses), and conducting indoctrination sessions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_122"><sup>122</sup></xref> The PMC considered these as keys to its success in mobilizing the population: from 1980 to 1985, the Takeo PMC received 16,416 people who volunteered to serve in the army.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_123"><sup>123</sup></xref></p>
<p>In August 1985, Kampong Thom received 69 defectors and 28 rifles while Battambang received 232 defectors and 103 rifles.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_124"><sup>124</sup></xref> During the same month, the Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey PMC carried out 43 operations outside of the province and received 170 defectors.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_125"><sup>125</sup></xref> The militias also carried out psychological operations and indoctrination missions in order to root out underground agents. For the first six months in 1985, the militia units, in conjunction with the Battambang PMC, were responsible for receiving 300 defectors as well as the recruitment of 30 hamlet militiamen and 467 village militiamen.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_126"><sup>126</sup></xref></p>
<p>In 1985, the number of defections was the highest in the war. In 1984, the PAVN launched a major dry season offensive and that combined with the KPRA&#x2019;s assertive indoctrination programs to produce the highest number of defections. It is important to note that the numbers listed below are those that belong to the &#x201C;Lost&#x201D; category and do not include the post-battle defection or those who surrendered during battle.</p>
<p>During the first six months of 1985, the PRK received a total of 2,000 defectors, of which 1,063 were former Khmer Rouge soldiers, 540 were
<target target-type="page" id="page_113"/>former KPNLAF soldiers, and 82 came from the ANS.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_127"><sup>127</sup></xref> But this number increased drastically towards the end of the year. In the first nine months of 1985, there was a drastic increase in the number of defectors that Battambang received. From January to September 1985, Battambang PMC alone received a total of 3,566 defectors (with 2,100 units of all types of weapons), which was a 250 percent increase compared to the number of defectors in the same period in 1984.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_128"><sup>128</sup></xref> There were a total of 116 collective defections (i.e. the enemies defected in units instead of individually), which was a five-fold increase in the same period in 1984 and the highest rank of the defectors was the regimental commander.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_129"><sup>129</sup></xref> Its neighboring province, Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey, also noted a similar increase. In the first nine months of 1985, the Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey PMC received a total of 2,300 defectors and 774 weapons of all types.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_130"><sup>130</sup></xref></p>
<p>The nature of the defection is telling. Because the defections did not occur in the immediate aftermath of the battle (the dry season offensive concluded in early 1985), military action alone might not be able to explain the high number of defections. It is true that the military operations might have worsened living conditions in the resistance camps, thus leading the guerrillas to cease activities and defect. Even if correct, such difficult conditions were also made possible by the strength of the KPRA conventional units and militias whose close relations with the people were the key to success. The military operations only intensified, not created, these defections. This book concludes that the military operations and political indoctrination worked in tandem to produce an unusually high number of defectors in 1985.</p>
<p>While the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> used many metrics to show the effectiveness of its political strategy, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> also admitted problems, even though they were usually cases of problems that had already been solved. An example was the case of the Svay Rieng PMC, which, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> noted, had never met the required target for popular recruitment into the army.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_131"><sup>131</sup></xref> The article admitted that the PMC was faced with various problems: the level of indoctrination was not sufficient, most people did not understand the importance of the indoctrination sessions and consequently did not attend, and finally, the instructors were not experienced enough to attract audiences.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_132"><sup>132</sup></xref> The problem was exacerbated by smuggling activities along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, where people were more occupied with lucrative trading opportunities than with attending indoctrination sessions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_133"><sup>133</sup></xref></p>
<p>In 1985, however, after a series of improvements made to the indoctrination process, the PMC improved on its propaganda performance. In the first nine months of 1985, the Svay Rieng PMC had conducted 67 indoctrination sessions that were attended by 23,379 people.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_134"><sup>134</sup></xref> The rate of volunteers also steadily increased. In the first semester of 1984, the PMC had recruited 51 new soldiers (past the 40-man target) and it had recruited 75 new soldiers during the second semester of 1984 (past the 45-man

<title>1989: time&#x2019;s up for indoctrination</title>
<p>Towards 1989, we see a different dynamic. The number of defectors returned to its 1980 rate while Premier Hun Sen of the PRK concluded that the defections decreased because the guerrillas wanted to take a gamble to defeat the PRK after the PAVN withdrew that year.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_137"><sup>137</sup></xref> Hun Sen said that these guerrillas will not put down their weapons before launching a major offensive, otherwise, they will lose the potential positions in the new government if they succeeded.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_138"><sup>138</sup></xref> There also seemed to be less news on the political indoctrination and the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> started to talk about recruitment to the PMC and mobile divisions instead. Unfortunately, perhaps due to the secrecy requirement, most articles did not contain meaningful data. The exact number of recruitment that each PMC had achieved was instead published twenty-three years later in the official unit history that was published by the Institute of Military History. Subsequent sections in this chapter will analyze the new data.</p>
<p>It suffices here to ask whether the wave of recruitment that the KPRA received in 1989 was due to its efforts in carrying out political programs and indoctrinations in the past. A close examination of the official unit history reveals some clues as to the everlasting effects of propaganda. After the election in 1993, Cambodia has decided to relinquish its communist ideology. Propaganda, let alone the 1980s propaganda, is no longer required in the official publications. Yet, all of the official unit history publications always started with the mentioning of the propaganda messages of the 1980s. At the beginning of the official history of the MR4 and MR5, for example, the authors noted that the unit&#x2019;s main missions were to fight in order to prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge regime, to save the people from famine, and to build the country.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_139"><sup>139</sup></xref> All other official unit history publications mentioned the same things.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_140"><sup>140</sup></xref> This is significant because the authors were former KPRA soldiers who continued to serve twenty-three years later and who, despite the fact that it is not required, still mentioned the political and indoctrination programs, good army-people relations, and civic actions as the main causes for success. The KPRA&#x2019;s political program, indoctrination, and propaganda, it seems, could linger after 1989 and maintain an army until 2012 (when the unit history was published) and beyond.</p>
<p>Before concluding this section, we should also note one major aspect of the KPRA&#x2019;s amnesty program. The conventional application of the program was known as &#x201C;amnesty and rewards,&#x201D; such as the one that was applied during the Vietnam War. But while most programs consisted of &#x201C;amnesty&#x201D; and &#x201C;rewards,&#x201D; it seems that the PRK program consisted mostly of &#x201C;amnesty.&#x201D; Perhaps due to the fact that the PRK did not have sufficient resources, the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> never mentioned any systematic rewards scheme
<target target-type="page" id="page_115"/>for the defectors in the &#x201C;Lost&#x201D; category. In the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic>, it seems, amnesty was at the heart of the PRK &#x201C;Lost&#x201D; program, while the offering of rewards seemed to depend on the local officials themselves.</p>
<p>In some cases, defection actually imposed a material cost to the defectors. This tended to suggest that indoctrination, not material or monetary reward, which played a role in inducing the defection. In a defection case in October 1984, a division in Battambang&#x2014;Banteay Meanchey province (which, based on the description, seems to be the 179th Division) received a total of 144 defectors who brought in 114 guns, 6 canoes, and 3 bicycles.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_141"><sup>141</sup></xref> The defectors were then received in a formal ceremony and then the authority helped resettle them to their province of birth, while the canoes and the bikes were not reclaimed by the defectors since they had given up those things to the state in the form of &#x201C;goodwill.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_142"><sup>142</sup></xref> The reception ceremony and the resettlement seemed to be the only things that the defectors could be sure to receive from the PRK. One could never be sure of material reward from the PRK.</p>
<p>That said, it does not mean that the PRK had never given out material rewards. In some cases where the local government was relatively well off, the defectors were able to receive some material assistance. Perhaps the case of the highest reward reported by the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> was the defection in village &#x201C;K&#x201D; [code name] in Pursat province in 1984. In November 1984, a woman succeeded in convincing her husband to return to the PRK control.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_143"><sup>143</sup></xref> The couple went to the village office together and turned in an AK assault rifle with a full magazine and a hand grenade. After the official reception event, the village authority solicited other people in the village who collectively donated to the couple fifty kilograms of rice, four meters of cloth, ten kilograms of salt, and some pocket money (which, in the Khmer tradition, can be taken to mean a token amount of money).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_144"><sup>144</sup></xref> No other defection event reported in the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> received such handsome rewards (by Cambodian standard at the time). In fact, there was not much reward provided at all.</p>
<p>Indeed, one may argue that a defector to the government today might return to the resistance tomorrow. Unfortunately, there was no data to prove or disprove this hypothesis. This book does not discount the possibility of this &#x201C;backsliding&#x201D; behavior. However, this book will submit that a large stream of defectors will certainly disrupt the resistance&#x2019;s military activities as well as exposing the revolutionary&#x2019;s underground networks. Moreover, if the defectors also became volunteers in the KPRA, then it might be the case that they have built an <italic>espirt de corps</italic> with the new organization and might be less likely to return to the resistance.</p>

<title>Result of indoctrination 1: the KPRA&#x2019;s provincial military commands (PMC)</title>
<p>This section provides a brief history of the main PMCs that this book will examine: Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Kampong Thom. The
<target target-type="page" id="page_116"/>examination is important because it will focus on how all of them built their local forces and then how much the mobile division depended on these commands for manpower. Instead of relying on forced conscription (conscription law was not implemented until 1988), the PRK rather depended on the provinces to build their own units and then transfer them to the divisions&#x2014;which should benefit from the <italic>esprit de corps</italic> resulting from shared values in the local community. In all of the PMCs, the main goal of the unit-building was always the support for the conventional divisions. This book submits that all of these were possible only with effective indoctrination programs carried out by the KPRA as described in the previous section.</p>

<title>History of the Battambang PMC</title>
<p>In 1980, Battambang-Banteay Meanchey had seven district companies. In 1984, from these companies, the province established three infantry battalions, which were combined to create an infantry regiment that was transferred to MR5. In 1988, because the province was too big for one command to control, and because the threat varied (the KPNLAF was active only in the Banteay Meanchey part of the province, while the Khmer Rouge and ANS were active in Battambang), the province was divided into two parts: Battambang and Banteay Meanchey. In total, after the split with Banteay Meanchey, Battambang had eight infantry battalions under its direct command. In 1988, three of these battalions were combined to create another independent regiment, again transferred to MR5.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_145"><sup>145</sup></xref></p>
<p>In 1989, the 196th Division was lacking manpower, and Battambang contributed five battalions to replenish it. The recruitment accelerated as 1989 approached. During the CGDK offensive in 1989, the Battambang PMC had a total of thirteen infantry battalions under its command after its contribution to the mobile divisions. In other words, Battambang constantly raised its forces and frequently contributed those forces to the regular units.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_146"><sup>146</sup></xref></p>
<p>In addition, three of the six KPRA mobile divisions stationed in this province. The 196th Division defended Pailin, the 4th Division defended Samlaut, and the 6th Division defended Malai. Before the split of the province, another mobile division, the 179th Division stationed in the Banteay Meanchey part of the province. There was a reason why Battam bang had this enormous formation: the NADK&#x2019;s main force operating in this area had two Fronts and two full divisions. In the areas around Malai, a town on the junction of the Cambodian-Thai border and the border between Battambang and Banteay Meanchey, stood the NADK&#x2019;s 450th Division, which was a full division. To the southwest, in Battambang proper, i.e. south of Sisophon, the provincial capital of Banteay Meanchey, the Khmer Rouge put Front 250 in charge. Front 250 operated from the Cambodian-Thai border across Battambang and extended into the Tonle Sap area. It consisted of four divisions and four full regiments. Further south, the
<target target-type="page" id="page_117"/>NADK&#x2019;s 415th Division (which was also a full division) operated in the Pailin area. Another important formation, Front 909, sought to divide Battambang and Pursat by operating along the border of the two provinces. Front 909 controlled nine small divisions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_147"><sup>147</sup></xref></p>

<title>History of Banteay Meanchey PMC</title>
<p>Before 1988, this northwest province was part of Battambang-Banteay Meanchey. The 179th Division (established in January 1979) was responsible for the Sisophon area and the northeast of the province. The geography and population distribution of Battambang-Banteay Meanchey was so complicated and so vast that the PRK decided to divide the province in two. On 7 January 1988, Banteay Meanchey province was formally inaugurated. It received five districts from the former province and created a new district and a provincial capital. Banteay Meanchey also inherited the service of the 179th Division.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_148"><sup>148</sup></xref></p>
<p>The 179th Division had three regiments: the 9th Regiment stationed at Preah Netr Preah district, the 10th Regiment stationed at Phnom Srok district north of the 9th Regiment, and the 11th Regiment was deployed to protect Route 69. Banteay Meanchey had five attachment units coming from outside: a contingent from Prey Veng PMC (battalion), the 69th Independent Armor Regiment (from MR4), the 12th Artillery Regiment (MR4), the 42nd Independent Regiment (MR4), and the 71st Infantry Regiment (MR4, which originated in Kampong Thom province).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_149"><sup>149</sup></xref></p>
<p>The structure of the new PMC was much heavier than that in Battambang due to its small size and disproportionate threat. Banteay Meanchey faced the bulk of the KPNLAF&#x2019;s forces. As a result, each district had at least two companies, and the provincial capital had six companies. Because Banteay Meanchey was a new province, it had combat companies instead of dual-duty companies. Nevertheless, these companies originated from the dual-duty companies when the province was still part of Battambang. In total, the province had twenty district companies and two battalions (52nd and 53rd). In 1989, the province upgraded all companies to battalions in anticipation of the KPNLAF offensive. Banteay Meanchey had a staggering twenty-two infantry battalions on the eve of the KPNLAF offensive. But such hasty upgrade produced a shortage of manpower. Each battalion was only a reduced battalion, having between two hundred and fifty and three hundred and seventy soldiers each.</p>

<title>History of Kampong Thom PMC</title>
<p>The 19th Battalion, an all-Cambodian battalion from Long Giao, was used as the basis for the creation of the Kampong Thom PMC. In 1981, the province had formed one infantry battalion (the 30th Battalion), six district companies and thirteen dual-duty companies. In 1983, the province
<target target-type="page" id="page_118"/>recruited five more dual-duty companies, and in 1984, it was able to create the 71st Regiment. Just like the regiments in Battambang, this regiment was transferred to Region 4. The following year, the province created two more battalions. One was 55th Riverine Infantry Battalion, which was in charge of security along the Steung Sen Tributary connecting the provincial capital to the Tonle Sap Lake. Another unit, Battalion 36A, was created for the purpose of defending the provincial capital. In 1986, the province created another district to the northeast and formed three companies. At the same time, it relinquished command of Battalion 36A which was augmented to establish the 72nd Regiment, once again transferred to Region 4.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_150"><sup>150</sup></xref></p>
<p>In 1988, the province began to accelerate its recruitment, as it expected heavy operations to come after the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops. Battalion 36B was formed to replace the transferred 36A. Another riverine infantry battalion, the 15th Battalion, was created in September 1988 but was again transferred to the Navy Directorate of the Ministry of Homeland Defense. In 1989, the province reached the highest point of its build-up with the following combat units: the 20th Infantry Regiment (two battalions), the 3rd, 30th, and 36B infantry Battalions, the 55th Riverine Infantry Battalion, thirty companies (in eight districts), one artillery battery, one armor company and one reconnaissance troop.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_151"><sup>151</sup></xref></p>
<p>The CGDK units operating in this area consisted of several NADK divisions and one ANS brigade. The NADK had seven divisions operating in the area. Only three, the 616th Division, 802nd Division, and 607th Division were indigenous to Kampong Thom. The 417th Division operated on the border of Kampong Thom, Kampong Cham, and Kratie. The 920th Division operated between this province and Kampong Cham, and the 980th Division operated in the area near Siem Reap&#x2019;s southern border. The 785th Division, in particular, was a transportation/special force division with forces stationed in Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, and Siem Reap. According to the former chief of staff of Siem Reap PMC, this unit was primarily a logistics unit but was also used to spearhead the attack in places where the normal units could not get through.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_152"><sup>152</sup></xref></p>
<p>The ANS had one brigade operating in Kampong Thom province, the 15th Brigade. The KPNLAF&#x2019;s OMZ7 also had some forces operating in Kampong Thom because a regimental commander was native to the province. The total number of the combined CGDK regular troops permanently fighting in Kampong Thom was estimated to be between fourteen and eighteen hundred soldiers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_153"><sup>153</sup></xref> However, the Khmer Rouge could easily mobilize other units to concentrate in this province as required.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_154"><sup>154</sup></xref></p>

<title>Result of indoctrination 2: Region 4, Military Region 4 and 5</title>
<p>The second echelon of territorial units were the Regions and Military Regions, which were the higher headquarters of several provinces in the same
<target target-type="page" id="page_119"/>areas. This higher headquarters had its own battalions and regiments, but its strength rested upon its mobility, armor, and heavy artillery, which it could mobilize to intervene in any provinces that were threatened by the CGDK. The Region and MR were the Cambodian successor units who stepped up to assume the responsibility of the departing PAVN. Therefore, we need to examine the organization of the latter.</p>
<p>The highest command headquarters of the PAVN units were organized into &#x201C;Front.&#x201D; The PAVN had four Fronts under the command of a supreme headquarters known as Front 719 based in Phnom Penh. Front 579 was supported by the PAVN Military Region 5 (meaning, the military region back in Vietnam) and controlled operations in Steung Treng, Ratanak Kiri, Mondul Kiri, parts of Kratie, and Preah Vihear. The Front&#x2019;s headquarters was in Steung Treng province. Front 979 was supported by Vietnam&#x2019;s Military Region 9 and controlled operations in Takeo, Kompot, Kampong Som, Koh Kong, Kampong Speu, Kampong Chhnang, Pursat, and parts of Battambang (from the town of Samlaut to the south). The Front&#x2019;s headquarters was on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, at the head of National Road 3, which led to Takeo-Kampot area. Front 797 was supported by Vietnam&#x2019;s Military Region 7 and controlled operations in Kratie, Kampong Cham, Prey Veng, and Svay Rieng. The Front&#x2019;s headquarters was in Kampong Cham.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_155"><sup>155</sup></xref></p>
<p>Finally, Vietnam&#x2019;s Military Region 7 supported another front, Front 479, based in Siem Reap&#x2019;s provincial capital and controlling operations in Battambang-Banteay Meanchey and Siem-Reap-Ouddar Meanchey. While Front 479 controlled only two provinces, the situation, population, and geography were very complicated, mainly because the area bordered with Thailand, which made it relatively easy for infiltration.</p>
<p>In late 1984, these four Fronts made way for the Cambodian military regions to take shape by shadowing their boundaries and responsibilities. At the beginning, the Cambodian military regions were known as &#x201C;Regions.&#x201D; Thus, Region 1 replaced Front 579, Region 2 replaced Front 797, Region 3 replaced Front 979, and Region 4 replaced Front 479. This book will focus only on Region 4 because the decisive operations between the PRK and the CGDK were fought in this area from 1989 to 1991.</p>
<p>In August 1984, Region 4 was formally inaugurated. The headquarters was in Siem Reap provincial capital, and then it gradually moved to replace the headquarters of Front 479 in front of Angkor Wat temple, less than ten kilometers from the provincial capital. About one kilometer from Angkor Wat temple was another temple complex, Angkor Thom, controlled by the Khmer Rouge. Region 4 controlled forces in three very large provinces: Battambang-Banteay Meanchey, Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey, and Pursat. All of the divisions operating in the area immediately fell under tactical control of Region 4.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_156"><sup>156</sup></xref></p>
<p>Region 4 had seven organic units: three maneuver regiments (41st, 42nd, and 43rd); the 69th Independent Armor Regiment; the 12th Artillery Regiment, Regiment 75A (protection); and Regiment 75B (combat engineer).
<target target-type="page" id="page_120"/>The Ouddar Meanchey part of the Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey province was isolated, but the Samraong district was densely populated and it acted almost as a PMC in its own right. The 43rd Regiment of Region 4 and the 286th Division stationed in the district.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_157"><sup>157</sup></xref></p>
<p>A few months after the PRK split Battambang and Banteay Meanchey, on 28 June 1988, Region 4 was also split into Military Region 4 (MR4) and Military Region 5 (MR5). MR5 controlled Battambang, Pursat, and Kampong Chhnang provinces while MR4 controlled Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey and Banteay Meanchey. Thus, MR4 benefited from the presence of the 286th Division, the 179th Division, and controlled the PMCs in its area of operations while MR5 had the 4th, 6th, and the 196th Divisions and its own PMCs in its area of operations.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_158"><sup>158</sup></xref></p>

<title>Territory-centric versus population-centric strategy</title>
<p>The last echelon of the KPRA was that of the mobile divisions. These units were under the control of the General Staff Headquarters but had to cooperate with the military regions where they operated. The mobile divisions were used to achieve objectives of highest importance. As a result, they would move around the country to where they were needed most. We shall examine the KPRA&#x2019;s strategy in this section and the next section will examine the impacts of the strategy on the mobile divisions.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese grand strategy in the Cambodian conflict was one of &#x201C;building the Cambodian force so that it can defend itself.&#x201D;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_159"><sup>159</sup></xref> As a country that had fought a war based on the People&#x2019;s War concept, this was not surprising. Nonetheless, the Vietnamese strategy in Cambodia was torn between a territory-centric strategy (protecting the territory) and a population-centric one (prioritize the protection of the population). During the Vietnam War, the PAVN and its allies adhered to a population-centric strategy, which was expedient given the superior American firepower. As the PAVN moved into Cambodia, however, it was the side that possessed superior firepower. The Vietnamese were thus torn. This book characterizes three phases of Vietnamese strategy in Cambodia.</p>
<p>The first phase of the Vietnamese strategy was the building of local governance, which was almost non-existent after the collapse of the Khmer Rouge regime. In fact, when the Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975, they fiercely hunted down all local officials or anyone who had any relations with the old regime. Building local governance from zero was a monumental task for the PRK and Vietnam. The first one to manage those duties was the armed forces. Thus, the PAVN assigned the local-governance military expert units (the units with four-digit numerical designation) to work hand in hand with the Cambodian units. Concurrently, the Central Committee of the Kampuchea People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Party also sent armed propaganda units to build the dual-duty units, the provincial battalions, and then regiments. In short, phase 1 was undeniably a population-centric strategy.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_121"/>In phase 2, the PAVN launched major operations along the border to clear the refugee camps from which the resistance launched the raids into the interior. In early 1985, most of the border camps were cleared, and all factions within the CGDK had to move their bases of operations into Thailand. This phase ended with the establishment and strengthening of the KPRA&#x2019;s mobile divisions: 4th, 6th, 179th, 196th, and 286th Divisions.</p>
<p>With the completion of this phase, the PAVN launched phase 3 of their strategy, which was perhaps the longest phase. The strategy then decidedly moved from population-centric to territory-centric. Just before the dry season offensive of 1984, the PRK and the Vietnamese had planned a controversial strategy known as the &#x201C;K-5&#x201D; belt strategy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_160"><sup>160</sup></xref> Conceived as a five-year plan, this strategy literally called for the construction of a &#x201C;wall&#x201D; along the Cambodian-Thai border. According to R&#x00E9;gaud, this wall was to be upgraded with the generous use of landmines, anti-infantry obstacles, tank ditches, and interior-line road networks.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_161"><sup>161</sup></xref> Laborers were sent from the interior to construct the wall in the dense, malaria-infested jungle, while the mobile divisions would move up to staff the outposts in the isolated areas along the border to protect the wall. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_162"><sup>162</sup></xref></p>
<p>The strategy was never published in any official documents, but the <italic>People&#x2019;s Army</italic> newspaper made numerous comments related to the strategy throughout the years. It was certainly not easy to comprehend how the Vietnamese, who were one of the masters of People&#x2019;s War, could come up with such a territory-centric strategy at the expense of a population-centric one. To be fair, the strategy of using conventional units in remote areas to interdict the resistance&#x2019;s infiltration was adopted by the US during the Vietnam War. But its effectiveness was highly questionable.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_163"><sup>163</sup></xref></p>
<p>As the years went on, both the KPRA and the PAVN realized that closing off a five hundred-plus kilometer border was no simple task. Even Premier Hun Sen, who had come to power in late 1984, had already disowned the strategy. Nevertheless, the Central Committee of the Kampuchea People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Party never totally abandoned the strategy, and while the wall and the anti-infantry obstacles were never totally constructed for the entire stretch of the Cambodian-Thai border, an enduring legacy of the K-5 belt strategy still cast a dark shadow on the mobile divisions and the PRK&#x2019;s reputation.</p>
<p>From the start, the K-5 belt strategy had many flaws and problems. First of all, the laborers who were recruited for the construction project were discontented by the hardship. Second, deploying the mobile divisions and territorial units far away from the population center for an extended period of time had a large negative effect on morale of the troops.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_164"><sup>164</sup></xref> Thus, after the PAVN raided the border camps in 1984 and 1985, it began its gradual withdrawal to the rear, while the KPRA mobile divisions assumed positions to the front: the 4th Division in Samlaut, the 196th Division in Pailin, the 6th Division in Malai, the 179th Division in Banteay Meanchey, the 286th Division in Ouddar Meanchey, and even a sizeable number of territorial units
<target target-type="page" id="page_122"/>also had to leave their provinces to move to protect the border. Third, this strategy effectively pushed all units into isolated positions, and firepower became the only thing that prevented the resistance from overrunning the positions. As a consequence of this strategy, the KPRA had to adhere to a six-month stockpile logistics system because the positions were too far away to maintain continuous re-supply. The deteriorating quality of the food resulting from this doctrine put a further burden on the morale of the troops.</p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_123"/>The irony of this episode was that the Vietnamese, who had defeated the American strategy of bringing the fight away from the population centers, found themselves implementing the very same strategy in Cambodia. The KPRA was pushed to defend isolated outposts in the jungle, not unlike what the American troops did during the Vietnam War. The CGDK intended to give the Vietnamese a taste of their own medicine.</p>

<title>The KPRA mobile divisions went to war along the border</title>
<p>From 1979 to 1989, all of the mobile divisions were oriented towards the border. Similar to the territorial forces, the KPRA&#x2019;s regular units were also born out of the all-Cambodian battalions that came from Long Giao province in 1979. Most of these battalions became the &#x201C;genesis battalion&#x201D; that formed the backbone of the PMC in many provinces. Initially, each province, except Phnom Penh and Kampong Cham, was allocated one battalion. But instead of becoming the genesis battalion that gave birth to the territorial troops in each province, some battalions combined to create brigades and then divisions. In the beginning, there were four divisions: 4th, 179th, 196th, and 286th. After the dry season offensive of 1984&#x2013;1985, a new division, the 6th Division was created. These divisions were stationed in the areas where the decisive operations between the PRK and the CGDK occurred. Many other divisions that the KPRA created after 1989 will not be discussed here as they did not have the extensive battlefield activities as the former five divisions.</p>
<p>To the northwest of Battambang-Banteay Meanchey was the frontier town of Pailin, well known for its gemstone quarry. The 196th Division was the unit that defended this town. The 196th Division was formally inaugurated on 19 June 1981 and had three regiments: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. To the south of Pailin was another frontier town, Samlaut, which was the site of the 1968 farmer&#x2019;s rebellion. This area was under the control of the 4th Division. Just like the 196th Division, the 4th Division traced its origin to the all-Cambodian battalions from Long Giao. These battalions were first com bined to create the 2nd Brigade. Between 1981 and 1982, the brigade moved to Pursat to guard Route 56, in the Veal Veng area. Around 1983, it fought with the PAVN&#x2019;s 339th Division, which defended the border between Pursat and Battambang-Banteay Meanchey. In April 1983, in anticipation for the 1984 dry season offensive, the brigade became the 4th Division, but it would
<target target-type="page" id="page_124"/>constantly raise its forces to become a full division. The 4th Division had three maneuver regiments: 13th, 14th, and 15th as well as nine functional battalions.</p>
<p>The original mission of this unit was to cover National Road 4, which linked the capital to the sea port at Kampong Som (Sihanouk Ville). But the area was more secure thanks to the geography. To the west, along the Cambodian-Thai border, was the steepest summit of the Cardamom Mountain. To cross from the Thai province of Trat into the interior of Cambodia would take at least a week&#x2019;s march through rugged terrain. The KPRA General Staff Headquarters had determined that the avenue of approach would be very difficult for the Khmer Rouge to sustain large-scale infiltration. In effect, the PMC would be enough to deal with the threat and the division would be much more useful elsewhere. In 1987, as the PAVN withdrew, the 4th Division was pushed northward to defend the southern part of Battambang.</p>
<p>Later, part of the 14th Regiment was detached from the 4th Division and was augmented to become the 94th Brigade, which then defended National Road 5 at the border between Pursat and Battambang. Part of the 13th Regiment also had to stay behind to help cover the rear position of the new brigade. So when the 4th Division was pushed to Samlaut, it had only one full maneuver regiment (15th Regiment), two understrength regiments, a headquarters unit, as well as the nine functional battalions. In short, the 4th Division (and its former units) arrayed its forces to cover the Cambodian-Thai border from Pursat to Samlaut in Battambang.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_165"><sup>165</sup></xref></p>
<p>Pailin and Samlaut were almost like twin-cities. If one traveled from the Battambang provincial capital via Route 10 through Ratanak Mondul district, the road would fork at Traeng village, where the northern route would lead to Pailin, and the southern route to Samlaut. The 196th Division and the 4th Division had to support each other. Should either one fail or should the Khmer Rouge capture the crossroad at Ratanak Mondul district and Traeng, the other unit would be isolated and risk annihilation.</p>
<p>The third division that stationed in Battambang-Banteay Meanchey was the 179th Division. Just like other conventional divisions, this unit was also born out of the Long Giao battalions. These battalions were combined to create the 4th Brigade. Just before the 1984&#x2013;1985 dry season offensive, the 4th Brigade was augmented to become the 179th Division. The division had three regiments: 9th, 10th, and 11th. On 5 December 1984, the 9th and 10th Regiments fought alongside the PAVN in the campaign that destroyed all major resistance&#x2019;s camps along the Cambodian-Thai border in the vicinity of Banteay Meanchey area. The 179th Division arrayed its forces to protect the eastern flank of Banteay Meanchey province when the province was inaugurated in 1988.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_166"><sup>166</sup></xref></p>
<p>Lastly, to the east, the province of Siem Ream-Ouddar Meanchey had only one division but it was a heavy, mechanized division. The 286th Division was born out of the Long Giao battalions that followed the PAVN to Siem
<target target-type="page" id="page_125"/>Reap. On 19 November 1979, these battalions combined to create the 3rd Brigade. On 28 June 1980, the brigade was augmented to become the 286th Division. The main mission of the 286th Division was to defend Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey province as well as its border with Thailand.</p>
<p>Due to the geography that divided the province into two parts and because the territorial troops were able to maintain security in the areas surrounding the provincial capital, the 286th Division was pushed north past the Kulen Mountain. The area was the Ouddar Meanchey part of the province, where terrain was flat, making it relatively easy for tanks and other armored vehicles to move around. The 286th Division had three combined arms regiments (i.e. a combination of armor, artillery, and infantry units), one artillery regiment, and nine functional battalions. One of its regiments, the 44th Regiment had four battalions, all of which were raised from the Prey Veng PMC.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_167"><sup>167</sup></xref></p>
<p>Due to the importance of the Samraong and Chong Kal district, the 286th Division was not deployed to protect the border. It stayed behind to protect the two districts. MR4 also dispatched the 43rd Regiment to help shore up the defense of the two districts. Perhaps still true to its K-5 belt strategy, MR4 also deployed the 41st Regiment to defend the isolated village of Anlong Veng. The unit was completely isolated.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_168"><sup>168</sup></xref></p>
<p>In 1985, after the 16-Camps Campaign, as the PAVN prepared to move away from the frontline, the KPRA established another new unit, the 6th Division. The origin of this division was different from those of the previous four. The latter were born out of the all-Cambodian battalions from Long Giao. These battalions were not the only Cambodian units who fought in 1979, however. As the PAVN moved into Cambodia in 1979, it also raised new units from the refugees encountered along the way. These forces were embedded into Vietnamese units. For example, in one mixed battalion, there could be three Vietnamese companies and one Cambodian company.</p>
<p>The 6th Division was born out of the Cambodian units embedded to the PAVN&#x2019;s 8th Division of Front 979, which was stationed in Kampot province. The mission of the 6th Division was to guard the border wall and fill in the gap between the 179th Division and the 196th Division as well as to protect the border between Battambang and Banteay Meanchey. Deployed to the remote area called Malai, it was perhaps the most isolated unit of all the divisions. Yet, its situation was representative of all the divisions. If travelled by foot from the nearest population center to the division headquarter, the journey took at least one week, and the road was practically unusable during the rainy season.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_169"><sup>169</sup></xref> Khmer Rouge ambush along this road was a certainty.</p>
<p>The 6th Division had the highest commander casualty rate of all the divisions. The area was infested with malaria, and the water source had a high calcium concentration that severely affected the soldiers&#x2019; urinary tracts. Apart from enemy actions, disease and sanitation problems ranked second in generating casualties among soldiers of the 6th Division. In the
<target target-type="page" id="page_126"/>&#x201C;stockpile&#x201D; concept of logistics, during the entire dry season period, the transportation corps would struggle to supply the division for six months, covering the whole rainy season. All other units encountered similar problems.</p>
<p>However, this division made up for these problems by having two advantages: numbers and good commanders. The division had around seven thousand soldiers on average, which was one of the biggest among the regular units, which generally could muster only around five thousand. The commander was a graduate of the M.V. Frunze Military Academy in the former Soviet Union, and his deputy commander was also a product of a Soviet military school. Even today, the former commander claimed that he had never lost a battle in which he personally had commanded troops.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_170"><sup>170</sup></xref> Nevertheless, a good division must have both good commanders and committed soldiers. The KPRA would discover this the hard way in the 1989 CGDK offensive.</p>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<label>4.5</label>
<title>Summary and discussion: a war of numbers</title>
<p>Due to a lack of resources, it seemed that the KPRA had to rely on ideology and manpower. Its military system was essentially built to meet this challenge. The KPRA had no air force or navy. To be fair, it started to buy some MiG fighters from the Soviet Union and sent many pilots there for training, but it almost never used the planes in its operations. The reason was simple: a simple strafing run could easily take the plane across the Cambodian-Thai border. The KPRA did have patrol boats and a Navy Directorate, but once again, the priority was land warfare. By 1989, the result of this priority was clear.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4_1">Table 4.1</xref> shows the estimated total of KPRA soldiers in 1987 which roughly corresponds to the estimate of Western scholars. Westad and Quinn-Judge, for example, put the number of regular troops at 100,000 and the militias at 200,000; both numbers are for 1989.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_171"><sup>171</sup></xref> In the Cambodian Civil War, the difference between the numbers of conven tional forces and territorial forces was staggering. The number of militias (popular forces) alone outnumbered the regular troops by a ratio of almost 2 to 1. When combined with the territorial troops, this ratio jumps to an astonishing 3 to 1 numerical superiority in favor of the territorial and popular forces.</p>
<p>With a combined manpower of about twenty thousand soldiers, the mobile divisions struggled to defend the long border without air support. In addition, the combined territorial troops in Battambang and Banteay Meanchey amounted to thirty-five battalions in 1989, excluding the militias and units that were sent to replenish the mobile divisions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_172"><sup>172</sup></xref> In other words, the total number of mobile divisions and the territorial troops in these two provinces was equal to the total number of the Khmer Rouge forces operating in the entire country. As we count the reinforcement from MR2, MR4, MR5, Siem Reap-Ouddar Meanchey PMC, Pursat PMC, and of the 286th
<target target-type="page" id="page_127"/>Division, as well as the militias in MR4 and MR5, the KPRA simply outnumbered all three CGDK factions. Once we count the strategic reserve, which might have consisted of the combat police, the newly established 5th and 7th Divisions, and the Kampong Thom and Preah Vihear PMC, the CGDK seemed to have a numerical problem. In addition to the numbers, all mobile divisions received reinforcements from the territorial troops, and the territorial troops themselves were considered to be part of a comprehensive defense system. These people not only outnumbered the resistance, they did so on their own turf. The KPRA&#x2019;s ability to mobilize the people and integrate them into a comprehensive defense system made life hard for the CGDK.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_173"><sup>173</sup></xref></p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_"/>In the Cambodian Civil War from 1979 to 1991, therefore, the KPRA&#x2019;s numerical superiority was clear. What caused this disparity? This book concludes that this must have been the result of high morale. First of all, there was no conscription law until 1988. The PRK could easily pass such a law, but it did not, which leads this book to conclude that the PRK did not need a law to recruit people into the army.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_174"><sup>174</sup></xref> In addition, financial rewards also did not seem to be the only reason people served because almost two-thirds of the KPRA forces were territorial forces and they received only meager revenue from serving. Finally, we can safely assume that there was no ghost soldier or ornamental soldier (those who inflated the payroll but did not actually serve). At least these soldiers did not exist in an alarming number, otherwise the scandal would be exposed when those units were transferred to the mobile divisions in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>The next logical question is, where did the high morale, if it existed, come from? First of all, the PRK had a clear political program, namely the prevention of the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s return. Second, this program was imple mented by the armed propaganda units, which were later upgraded into dual-duty
<target target-type="page" id="page_129"/>companies. The military organization was inextricably linked to propa ganda, indoctrination, and the implementation of the political program. Using the prevention of the Khmer Rouge&#x2019;s genocidal regime as a cause, the dual-duty companies later recruited more people to serve in the provincial battalions and regiments.</p>
<p>Based on the current state of the documents and the archive, there was no evidence to support an alternative explanation of the high level of morale other than indoctrination and the military organization that facilitated such activities. In other words, we observed a strong indoctrination program and strong message and these correlated with the high morale. The current archive and documents did not offer any other alternative explanation. The existing evidence was also anecdotal in nature. In one example, as the Vietnamese troops prepared for the withdrawal in 1989, the PRK&#x2019;s local officials had showed their concerns that the Khmer Rouge might have returned and suggested they had served to prevent such an eventuality.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn_175"><sup>175</sup></xref> That official was the governor of Banteay Meanchey province who, as we will see in the next chapter, refused to abandon the province in the face of CGDK attack. Fear for the Khmer Rouge seemed to be one of the main reasons why people served in the KPRA, and the PRK&#x2019;s indoctrination programs reinforced that commitment.</p>
<p>Being the strongest party, the PRK did have its shortcomings. The strongest party tended to think that everything is possible, and that was perhaps the genesis of the K-5 belt strategy. Numerical and moral superiority notwithstanding, by pushing many units to the isolated border areas, the KPRA essentially gave up three main advantages that it had earned by laborious indoctrination work. First, their force became stretched out and consequently, the CGDK could mass its combat power to overwhelm and defeat each one in turn. Second, while the KPRA&#x2019;s territorial units knew the terrain in their locale, once they moved to the jungle, that advantage was lost. Third, as the mobile division absorbed the PMC reinforcements, the morale of the latter started to dip as they fought further away from their homes. With the K-5 belt strategy, the KPRA&#x2019;s advantage boiled down to only one: numerical superiority.</p>
<p>Thus, while the KPRA started with an excellent population-centric strategy, it drifted to territory-centric strategy as it became the strongest army on the battlefield. The PRK came to meet the 1989 CGDK combined offensive with an army that was scattered all along the border.</p>

<fn id="fn_160"><label>160</label><p>&#x201C;K-5&#x201D; is a transliteration from the Khmer version of the abbreviation, which uses the Khmer &#x201C;k&#x2019;orr&#x201D; and the number 5. There are conflicting accounts as to the origin of this strategy. One account claims that K-5 came from five Khmer words, all starting with &#x201C;k&#x2019;orr,&#x201D; which can be tentatively translated as: Construction Work for the Defense of Cambodia Homeland. Another account claims that the number 5 is both about the number of &#x201C;k&#x2019;orr&#x201D; in the abbreviation as well as the fact that it was a five-year plan. The literature on this issue is sketchy. Perhaps the best book on the subject is Margaret Slocomb&#x2019;s <italic>The People&#x2019;s Republic of Kampuchea, 1979-1989: The Revolution after Pol Pot.</italic> Nevertheless, while the book gave a good introduction of the K-5 belt strategy, it did not contain any discussions on military strategy, which was at the heart of the K-5 belt strategy.<target target-type="page" id="page_135"/></p></fn>

The costs were indeed heavy, but this book will not discuss the issue because the major concern here is the impacts of the K-5 strategy on the military units, which were also very dreadful.</p></fn>

After the war, units of the 6th Division were later broken up and then augmented to combine with the 196th Division, the KPNLAF, and the ANS elements in order to create new units like the 51st, 52nd, and 53rd intervention infantry brigades. That is the reason why the history of the 6th Division, as well as other divisions, were contained in the history of the intervention infantry brigades. This book collected parts and parcels of the stories from many official units&#x2019; histories and combined them to reconstruct the history of the 6th and 196th Divisions.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn_174"><label>174</label><p>The PRK did not require a law to raise an army since its ideology had attracted a lot of people to join. The PRK, however, did adopt a conscription law in 1989. Why? This is perhaps what explains the role of indoctrination and propaganda. One may argue that indoctrination and propaganda did indeed play a role in raising a large army for the PRK so much so that it did not need a conscription law. On the other hand, if one is to argue that the PRK had forced people into the army without a law before 1989, then we may ask why did it need such a law in 1989? Why did the PRK not just practice its lawless conscription? This book speculates that before 1989, the PRK did not have any problem recruiting its soldiers while after 1989, it tried to force con scription in order to overwhelm the CGDK after the Vietnamese left. A lack of confidence might also explain the existence of the conscription law in 1989.</p></fn>
