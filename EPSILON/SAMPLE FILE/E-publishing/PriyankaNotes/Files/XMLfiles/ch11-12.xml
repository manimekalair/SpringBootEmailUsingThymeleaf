<title>Radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>The bronchial tree begins at the termination of the trachea with its division into the right and left principal (or mainstem) bronchi. The principal bronchi are short and each divides into lobar bronchi (also known as secondary bronchi); these supply the various lobes of the lung and are named according to the lobe they supply (Figures 11.1 and 11.2<italic>)</italic>.</p>
<p>The right principal bronchus divides into four lobar bronchi, one for each lobe of the right lung: cranial, middle, caudal and accessory. The left principal bronchus divides into two lobar bronchi: cranial and caudal. The cranial secondary bronchus then divides to supply the cranial and caudal segments of the left cranial lung lobe. The left caudal secondary bronchus supplies the left caudal lung lobe.</p>
<p>Within each lobe the lobar bronchi subdivide further into segmental bronchi (sometimes referred to as tertiary bronchi). The segmental bronchi with the lung tissue they ventilate are called <italic>bronchopulmonary segments</italic>. Each bronchopulmonary segment is independent. Adjacent bronchopulmonary segments normally communicate with each other in the dog through the interalveolar pores of Kohn and channels of Lambert (see also Chapter 12). The segmental bronchi branch into smaller generations of bronchi until the formation of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs and pulmonary alveoli. The number of generations depends on the size of the animal and is difficult to measure.</p>
<p>The bronchial walls are formed by hyaline cartilage rings and spiral bands of smooth muscle. Bronchioles are commonly less than 1 mm in diameter and have no cartilaginous support.</p>
<p>Bronchi and the surrounding tissue, up to the level of the respiratory bronchioles, receive their blood supply from the bronchial artery, which, although variable in origin, is commonly a continuation of the broncho-oesophageal artery. Venous return is via the pulmonary circulation.</p>
<p>On radiographs the bronchi are usually poorly seen unless they have a thickened or calcified wall. Only the larger bronchi in the hilar region can normally be identified on survey radiographs. The location of a bronchus is between the pulmonary artery and the vein with the artery being dorsal (or cranial) in lateral views and lateral in dorsoventral (DV) or ventrodorsal (VD) views. Bronchial arteries are not seen on radiographs. The space between the paired pulmonary artery and vein on a radiograph does not necessarily represent the bronchial lumen. Bronchi should gradually taper towards the periphery.</p>

<title><xref ref-type="page" id="page_229"/>Radiographic signs of bronchial disease</title>
<p>It is important to note that the severity of the clinical signs in bronchial disease does not always correlate with the radiographic signs. In many dogs with clinical bronchitis the thoracic radiographs may appear normal.</p>
<p>When radiographic changes are present, bronchial disease is identified by increased visibility of the bronchial walls. It is first important to distinguish the reason for increased visibility. Mineralization of the bronchial wall is usually an incidental finding and is discussed in further detail below. Other reasons for increased visualization are usually pathological and may be secondary to bronchial thickening, mucosal thickening or peribronchial infiltration. These changes may be accompanied by alteration in the size and shape of the bronchial lumen.</p>
<p>It is possible to distinguish between normal bronchi, mineralized bronchi, thickened bronchi and those with shape changes on radiographs (Figures 11.3, 11.4 and 11.5). When bronchial walls are thickened they appear as &#x2018;doughtnuts&#x2019; when viewed end-on or as &#x2018;tramlines&#x2019; when viewed laterally. This is also referred to as a <italic>bronchial pattern</italic> (see also Chapter 12).</p>

Note that many dogs with chronic bronchitis show much milder or even no radiographic changes. (b) Bronchial mineralization (arrowed), which is an age-related change. (c) Multiple thickened bronchi (arrowed). (d) Bronchiectasis.

<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_230"/>Changes in size and shape (e.g. saccular, cylindrical shape when viewed in long axis) of the bronchial lumen, followed by loss of the normal tapering of the bronchial lumen towards the periphery indicate the presence of <italic>bronchiectasis</italic>.</p>
<p>When changes in the interstitial opacity occur around a bronchial structure then &#x2018;<italic>peribronchial cuffing</italic>&#x2019; may be seen. This has a similar appearance to a bronchial pattern but the pathological changes constitute a cellular infiltrate in the interstitium rather than the bronchial wall. An unstructured interstitial pattern may also be present.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial and peribronchial mineralization</title>
<p>Mineralization of the bronchial walls along the bronchial tree makes smaller bronchi more readily identifiable. This mineralization is a common and clinically insignificant finding in older animals but can also be seen in younger animals, especially in chondrodystrophoid breeds of dog. It results in the bronchial walls appearing as fine linear shadows when viewed laterally or as fine distinct circles when viewed end-on. These<italic> thin</italic> mineralized &#x2018;rings&#x2019; and &#x2018;tramlines&#x2019; should be differentiated from the thicker soft tissue opacities seen in bronchial disease (Figure 12.26, p. 254).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_231"/>Bronchial mineralization may also be seen in systemic pathological conditions, such as hyperadrenocorticism and renal secondary hyperparathyroidism (Figure 12.27, p. 254).</p>
<p>In cats calcification of the peribronchial mucus glands may occur without clinical signs. These are seen as small multifocal mineralized opacities, and may be difficult to distinguish from the rare condition broncholithiasis (see Diseases, below).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial obstruction</title>
<p>Bronchial obstruction can be produced by a variety of mechanisms (Figure 11.6). The same classification system can be applied to tracheal obstruction (see Chapter 10).</p>
<p>Morphological obstruction is a structural obstruction of the bronchus and may be further classified as intraluminal, intramural or extramural, depending on the origin of the obstruction. Morphological obstructions may be complete or incomplete depending on their size and location. Rarely a morphological obstruction (especially a foreign body) can create a &#x2018;check valve&#x2019; effect where air is permitted to pass the obstruction during inspiration when the bronchial lumen is wider, but not during expiration when the lumen is narrower. This results in peripheral air trapping and overinflation. This change may not be apparent on inspiratory radiographs but will be identified as a hyperlucent region of lung on expiratory films.</p>
<p>Functional obstructions occur when the bronchi constrict with resultant air trapping. This may occur in asthma or allergic bronchitis and is discussed further below (see Feline chronic lower airway disease).</p>
<p>Dynamic obstructions occur when there is loss of the normal recoil or rigidity of the bronchial walls, resulting in flattening or collapse during forcible expiration or coughing. This condition often accompanies tracheal collapse and is discussed in more detail below (see Bronchial collapse).</p>
<p>The radiographic features of bronchial obstruction depend on the location and degree of the obstruction, the effectiveness of collateral ventilation and the chronicity of the condition (see Figure 11.6).</p>
</sec3>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchography</title>
<p>Bronchography has been used in the past to outline the bronchial tree (see Figure 1.19, p. 12) and therefore allow for further investigation of bronchial disease. It was considered especially useful for the evaluation of chronic obstructive airway disease, chronic bronchitis, bronchial spasm, bronchiectasis (Figure 11.7), bronchial stenosis or compression, bronchogenic neoplasms (see Figure 12.49, p. 265), bronchial cysts and in the identification of radiolucent bronchial foreign material. The contrast medium agent most commonly used was an aqueous suspension of propyliodine.</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_232"/>Although the procedure was relatively simple it was not well tolerated by the patient and only one lung at a time could be assessed bronchographically. Fibre- optic bronchoscopy and bronchial computed tomography (CT) are less invasive and have completely replaced this technique.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial computed tomography</title>
<p>Bronchi and bronchioles are readily visible and easily assessed on thoracic CT examinations in both the dog and cat. The correct choice of algorithm and image display is essential. A standard axial or spiral lung protocol is usually employed throughout the thorax, followed by a high-resolution series (thin slice width, high kV and mA, and high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithms) through the areas of interest. As for lung CT, it is important to obtain images without respiratory motion (see also Chapter 3). A lung window should always be used when examining the lung parenchyma. Small focal lung lesions will not be visualized in a soft tissue window.</p>
<p>The bronchi are seen as thin-walled branching structures with well demarcated, smooth, hyperattenuating inner and outer walls (Figure 11.8). They are generally accompanied by a pulmonary artery and vein. Usually, the artery lies closer and follows the course of the bronchus more rigidly than the vein. The bronchi and larger bronchioles are easily visible, but the smaller bronchioles become increasingly difficult to identify towards the periphery of the lung. They may not be definitively identified within 1 cm of the periphery of the lung margin. Attempts have been made to characterize normal bronchial wall thickness and cross-sectional areas in the dog. In human thoracic CT, well established bronchial measurements and ratios are used to assess wall thickening and bronchiectasis.</p>
<p>CT provides many advantages over standard thoracic radiographs in the evaluation of the smaller airways. Bronchial rupture may be confirmed and localized. Intraluminal material such as foreign bodies and mucus plugs are easily identified. CT achieves visualization of tiny bronchioles that cannot be accessed by bronchoscopy and also has the advantage that intravenous contrast medium can be administered to aid in the differentiation of neoplastic and inflammatory intraluminal masses from foreign material. Bronchiectasis, whilst sometimes difficult to evaluate radiographically, can be definitively identified with lung CT (Figure 11.9). Different types of bronchiectasis may be distinguished on CT images, such as traction bronchiectasis seen in conditions of interstitial fibrosis (see Chapter 12). Dynamic CT studies may be used in the evaluation of bronchial collapse in dynamic airway disease just as for the trachea (see Chapter 10).</p>

<p>The image was obtained just caudal to the carina. The mainstem bronchi are marked with a B and sit dorsal to the heart. Note the thin smooth hyperattenuating walls. The oesophagus (O) is air filled. (b) Transverse CT image obtained more caudally at the level of the cranial liver. Many small branches of the bronchial tree are clearly seen; one bronchus is marked (arrowed).</p>
</fig>
<p>CT is helpful in the differentiation of peribronchial infiltrates and peribronchial masses from true bronchial masses and also provides valuable information for presurgical planning (see Figures 12.38, p. 260 and 12.61a, p. 270). Multiplanar reconstructions may be particularly useful. CT-guided biopsy can be used for further evaluation of bronchial and peribronchial mass lesions. This is a useful and relatively safe procedure when minimal aerated lung is penetrated to obtain a tissue sample. CT is also useful for staging neoplastic bronchial disease, as the bronchial and tracheobronchial lymph nodes can be visually assessed for evidence of metastatic disease (see Chapter 8).</p>

<p>Compare the bronchi to those seen in Figure 11.8a, which was obtained from the same region of the lungs. Markedly thickened bronchial walls are seen. Many bronchi are enlarged, have lost their normal round shape and are peripherally distended, consistent with bronchiectasis.</p>
</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_233"/>A rapidly developing technique in the human medical field is the use of multidetector CT to obtain non-invasive &#x2018;virtual bronchoscopy&#x2019; images. The images produced closely resemble those seen with fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Although it is widely considered that this technique will not replace standard fibreoptic bronchoscopy, it has value in certain clinical situations and may be used to direct more invasive procedures.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial ultrasonography</title>
<p>The presence of aerated lung surrounding bronchial structures means that they are inaccessible to ultrasonographic examination. However, bronchi are occasionally seen on an ultrasound examination when the surrounding lung lobe is collapsed or consolidated, eliminating the air content, thus providing an acoustic window for the evaluation of intrapulmonary structures including the bronchi. When fluid is present within the bronchial lumen they are referred to as &#x2018;fluid bronchograms&#x2019; (see Chapter 12). It is also possible to identify bronchiectasis in this situation.</p>

<title>Diseases</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Canine chronic bronchitis</title>
<p>Chronic bronchitis is an inflammatory disease of the airways. Animals usually present with a history of <italic>chronic harsh cough</italic> (more than 2 months) and exercise intolerance. Typically middle-aged to older small-breed dogs are predisposed, but the disease is also common in large breeds. Tracheal sensitivity may be present on clinical examination and inspiratory crackles and expiratory wheezes may be identified on auscultation. Heart rate is usually normal to low and a pronounced sinus arrhythmia may be present.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of chronic bronchitis in the dog and cat is usually one of exclusion. Other conditions such as infectious airway disease, structural airway disease (collapse, bronchiectasis) and neoplasia must be ruled out.</p>
<p>The condition is never completely cured but can be controlled by a combination of medical therapy, weight loss and environmental changes (reduced smoke, pollutants, heat, etc.). When poorly controlled, bronchitis may result in irreversible bronchiectasis and even pulmonary hypertension (secondary to chronic hypoxia and/or vascular remodelling).</p>

<title>Canine acute bronchitis</title>
<p>Thoracic radiographs in cases of acute bronchitis are indicated mainly to rule out other diseases or complications, especially if clinical signs are severe or prolonged. Many animals with acute bronchitis show no radiographic changes. Acute bronchitis may appear as a bronchial pattern irrespective of the cause and radiographic findings are similar to those seen in canine chronic bronchitis (see above).</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Feline chronic lower airway disease</title>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_234"/>Feline chronic lower airway disease encompasses a multitude of small airway diseases in the cat including <italic>feline asthma</italic>. Inflammation of the airways leads to a reversible obstruction to airflow (functional obstruction) and hence air trapping. The obstruction is due to a combination of bronchoconstriction, bronchial wall oedema and submucosal gland hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Clinical signs vary from chronic coughing and wheezing to severe respiratory distress. The condition can affect cats of any age with Siamese appearing to have an increased incidence. Hyper-responsive airways and reversible airflow obstruction lead to a reduced airway diameter and increased airway resistance. The condition can be extremely severe in presentation and care should be taken when handling dyspnoeic cats.</p>

<title>Bronchiectasis</title>
<p>The word bronchiectasis was derived from the Greek words &#x2018;bronchos&#x2019; meaning bronchus and &#x2018;ectasis&#x2019; meaning extension. Bronchiectasis is irreversible <italic>bronchial dilatation</italic> often with accumulation of pulmonary secretions. It can be focal or disseminated and it is uncommon in dogs and rare in cats.

<p>It can occur as a sequel to long-standing infectious or inflammatory pulmonary disease, secondary to airway obstruction or smoke inhalation, as a complication to radiation-induced pneumonitis or in association with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Also, it has been noted that halothane dilates airways by blocking baseline vagal tone.</p>
<p>Bronchial secretions accumulate in the dilated bronchi and predispose the patient to recurrent airway and pulmonary infections.</p>

<title>Primary ciliary dyskinesia</title>
<p>Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), also known as <italic>immotile cilia syndrome</italic>, is a diverse group of inherited structural and functional abnormalities of the respiratory and other cilia, which results in recurrent respiratory tract infections in the dog. More specifically, PCD is an inherited defect in microtubule formation, affecting cilia of the respiratory and urogenital tract and the auditory canal.</p>
<p>Typically PCD is diagnosed in young purebred animals with a reported higher incidence in the Bichon Frise. The condition may be seen in mixed breed dogs and also in cats.</p>
<p>There is a relatively high prevalence of a respiratory disease and the phenotype is almost identical to PCD in humans. The respiratory manifestations include chronic rhinitis, bronchitis and severe pneumonia with or without bronchiectasis. Affected animals are presented with recurrent chronic nasal discharge, productive cough, respiratory distress and exercise intolerance. Additional findings are infertility, hydrocephalus and loss of hearing.</p>
<p>Assessment of deficient mucociliary transport is initially performed with nuclear scintigraphy. Transmission electron microscopy of nasal or bronchial respiratory epithelium or seminal samples provides confirmation of the diagnosis.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>There are variable findings including bronchitis and pneumonia with or without bronchiectasis (Figure 11.16).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>Feline PCD has been reported in a 2.5-year-old cat with morphological alterations in the ultrastructure of oviductal cilia. CT findings were consistent with early lesions of bronchiectasis. Foci of pleural thickening and interstitial enlargement were also observed.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Scintigraphy</title>
<p>To perform a scintigraphic study (see Chapter 5) a droplet of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA is deposited in the distal aspect of the trachea. The diagnosis is confirmed by the absence of movement of the radiopharmaceutical droplet throughout the scintigraphic study (Figure 11.17). It should be noted that droplet movement <italic>always</italic> indicates normal ciliary function (i.e. no false-negatives). Findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>False-positives (no droplet movement) may occur if the droplet is deposited in an ulcerated area of the trachea, in an area of thick mucus or inside the endotracheal tube</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_237"/>Occasionally the droplet may move initially, then come to a stop; this happens most commonly because the droplet comes in contact with the end of the endotracheal tube or because it encounters an area of exudate, mucus or ulceration.</p></list-item>

<title>Kartagener&#x2019;s syndrome</title>
<p>Kartagener&#x2019;s syndrome is an uncommon congenital condition that has been reported in several breeds of dogs. It can be considered as a subset of PCD and is characterized by PCD with situs inversus, rhinosinusitis and bronchiectasis.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial collapse</title>
<p>Bronchial collapse may occur concurrently with tracheal collapse (see Chapter 10). Usually animals are presented with a history of chronic non-productive cough or respiratory difficulty. The condition is more common in dogs (especially small and toy breeds) than in cats. The disease is caused by progressive bronchial cartilage degeneration and results in a dynamic bronchial obstruction. Changes may occur in the mainstem bronchi and/or the more peripheral smaller airways. The remainder of this discussion refers to mainstem bronchial collapse. The gold standard for diagnosis of this condition is fibreoptic bronchoscopy. However, radiographic and fluoroscopic examination provide a preliminary two-dimensional (2D) evaluation and dynamic CT may provide a non-invasive screening alternative to bronchoscopy.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Narrowed lumen</italic> of principal or lobar bronchi near the carina. This may be demonstrated better on a lateral thoracic radiograph taken during expiration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung fields are usually normal.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Fluoroscopic and bronchoscopic examination are usually required for evaluation of intrathoracic airway collapse and the mainstem bronchi.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Fluoroscopy</title>
<p>This provides dynamic evaluation of bronchial lumen changes and associated tracheal collapse. The patient can remain conscious for evaluation and can also be assessed during an induced cough. It is surpassed by fibreoptic bronchoscopy as fluoroscopy remains a 2D study.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>This allows identification of the narrowed or collapsed bronchus. Other causes of narrowing such as external compression or intraluminal material can be excluded. Dynamic CT may be used for real-time assessment of collapse.</p>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial foreign body</title>
<p>A variety of foreign bodies may be inhaled, for example plant awns, toys, pebbles, bones, peanuts, dental calculus and even teeth.</p>
<p>The foreign body may cause complete or incomplete morphological bronchial obstruction and hence a wide spectrum of radiographic changes (see Figures 1.19, p. 12, 6.5, p. 85 and 11.7). Smooth foreign bodies (metal, marbles, pebbles) do not cause irritation, but usually cause obstruction. These do not usually pass beyond the carina. Irritant foreign bodies (such as seeds or grass awns with rough surfaces) may cause intense focal bronchial irritation with or without obstruction.</p>
<p>Bronchial foreign bodies should be considered in animals with an acute onset progressing to chronic cough. Animals with laryngeal paralysis are more likely to aspirate material. Eventually pneumonia, bronchiectasis and even pulmonary abscessation may result. Identification of the underlying cause can be a diagnostic challenge.</p>
</sec2>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>The foreign body will be visible if it is radiopaque. No radiographic changes may be seen in the early stages if the foreign body is radiolucent and collateral ventilation is maintained.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Complete blockage of a mainstem bronchus with loss of collateral ventilation causes lobar atelectasis and a resultant increase in opacity and a mediastinal shift towards the affected lobe. Pleural effusion may be seen around the collapsed lobe.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complete blockage of a smaller bronchus with collateral ventilation maintained may cause no radiographic changes or focal consolidations due to infection, and trapped secretions, especially along a bronchus (Figure 11.18), may be identified.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Incomplete obstruction with &#x2018;check valve&#x2019; effect appears as a hyperlucency and volume gain (mediastinal shift away from the lesion). It is important to acquire both end-expiratory and end-inspiratory radiographs to aid diagnosis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An irritant non-obstructing foreign body causes a focal interstitial opacity with central radiolucency and increased bronchial pattern (Figure 11.19), resulting from focal pneumonia. Over time more severe pneumonia, bronchiectasis and lung abscessation are seen.</p></list-item>

<title>Bronchial neoplasia</title>
<p>Bronchial tumours are a type of primary pulmonary tumour. Primary pulmonary tumours are uncommon in dogs and cats. Most primary lung tumours arising from the bronchial epithelium are carcinomas. Cytology and histopathology can provide the definitive diagnosis. Bronchoalveolar carcinoma, for example, has the unique characteristic of extension along the airways and alveolar septa with occasional projections into the alveolar lumen.</p>
<p>The clinical signs of animals with bronchial tumours vary. Chronic cough unresponsive to antibiotics, exercise intolerance, tachypnoea and overt respiratory distress may be seen in dogs. Cats may be presented with signs including anorexia, weight loss, lethargy, tachypnoea, dyspnoea and non-productive cough.</p>
<p>Regional lymph nodes, the pleura and other organs should be assessed for metastatic disease. CT is particularly useful in this respect and should be considered when surgical resection is contemplated.</p>

Solitary nodules, multiple non-circumscribed interstitial nodules, diffuse opacities or alveolar consolidation may be seen</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Feline bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Three main patterns have been described: mixed bronchoalveolar pattern, ill defined alveolar mass and mass with cavitation. All cats have a co-existing bronchial pattern. Cavitation is common, suggesting a tendency for the tumour to form necrotic centres.

<p>This is more sensitive than radiography for the detection of small lesions. It allows excellent assessment of the location and course of the tumour, the presence of tissue within the bronchial lumen, cavitation and necrosis, mineralization, etc.</p>
<p>The CT appearance of bronchial neoplasms (Figure 11.21) is variable. CT-guided biopsy may be performed. CT is extremely useful for surgical planning. It may detect enlarged regional lymph nodes suggestive of metastasis and thus assist with tumour staging.</p>

<title>Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia</title>
<p>Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a rare inflammatory condition in the cat and dog and is a multifactorial disease. The characteristic pathohistological finding is granulated tissue plugs within the lumen of small airways, which extend into the alveolar ducts and alveoli. Definitive diagnosis relies on lung biopsy. In humans BOOP may be secondary to a usual interstitial pneumonia. A few case reports exist in dogs, and CT and open or keyhole lung biopsy have been used successfully for diagnosis.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographically various combinations of bronchial, interstitial and alveolar patterns may be seen. One case report in the dog describes a diffuse interstitial pattern in all lung fields.

<p>The lungs appear almost as lucent (dark) as the air outside of the patient (lower left corner). Air does not attenuate the X-ray beam, and inflated lung mainly consists of air. Visible pulmonary structures include lung vessels in side-on (white arrowheads) or end-on (black arrowheads) orientation, and mineralized bronchial walls (arrowed). (b) Close-up of a lateral radiograph of normal lung tissue caudodorsal to the carina (C). First- to third-order vascular branches and mineralized bronchi are easily distinguishable.

The superimposed descending aorta contributes an additional homogenous increase in opacity to the upper half of the image.</p>

<list-item><p>Soft tissue opacity of the blood vessels, lung interstitium, bronchial and alveolar walls</p></list-item>

</p>
<p>Due to the large proportion of air-filled spaces in the lungs, the normal lung is very lucent (Figure 12.5a). Dogs and cats have very little interstitial lung tissue and no lobular septations (classified as type II lung), which therefore contribute only minimally to the overall lung opacity. A fine reticular background on normal lung tissue, as occasionally seen radiographically, is the result of small vascular and interstitial structures (Figure 12.5b).</p>
<p>The pulmonary vessels can be seen within the parenchyma due to the contrast provided by the surrounding pulmonary gas (Figure 12.5a). Other structures that may be seen in a normal canine lung are the walls of the airways to the level of the primary and secondary divisions of the bronchi; they appear as thin parallel soft tissue or mineralized lines that branch into the periphery (Figure 12.5).</p>

<p>Notice the more dorsal location of the origin of the right stem bronchus compared with the left one, which is used as a landmark. The two most cranially oriented bronchi are accompanied dorsally by the artery, and ventrally by the vein. Maximal normal diameter of the cranial lung lobe vessels should not exceed the width of the proximal third of the fourth rib (arrowed). (b) Close-up of a DV thoracic radiograph of the right caudal thorax in a dog. The artery (red arrow) and vein (blue arrow) of the right caudal lung lobe are smaller than the width of the ninth rib where they intersect (yellow arrow).</p>
</fig>
<p>Only the functional vascular system is radiographically visible. The major pulmonary arteries and veins are the most prominent radiopaque structures within the normal lungs. They are larger at the hilus and then branch and taper progressively towards the periphery. They appear as band-like soft tissue opacities when viewed along their long axis, and as nodule-like opacities when viewed end-on (see Figure 12.5a).</p>
<p>In dogs and cats, the pulmonary arteries are directly adjacent to the bronchial tree along their entire course, whereas the veins separate from the bronchus at the segmental level (bronchoarterial lung type). This means that small pulmonary veins may be seen at some distance from the corresponding bronchus, and that the distance between the arteries and corresponding veins does not exactly represent the bronchial diameter (Figure 12.6). The pulmonary arteries and veins can be differentiated based on their relationship to the mainstem bronchi (Figures 12.7 and 12.8).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_246"/>The cranial lung lobe arteries and veins can only be differentiated on a lateral view. A left lateral view is better because there is less superimposition of left and right bronchovascular structures. On a left lateral view, the left and right cranial and middle pulmonary vessels are arranged in the following order in an anti-clockwise direction (Figure 12.8a):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Right cranial lobe (most craniodorsal)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cranial segment of the left cranial lobe</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Caudal segment of the left cranial lobe</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Right middle lobe (most caudoventral).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The right cranial lobe bronchovascular structures can also be located ventral to those of the cranial segment of the left cranial lung lobe on this view. The left cranial lung lobe can be recognized as such because of the short common lobar bronchus, which divides into the cranial and caudal segmental bronchi. Caudal lung lobe arteries and veins can only be differentiated on a dorsoventral (DV) or ventrodorsal (VD) view. A DV view is better because the dorsal part of the caudal lungs is more ventilated than on a VD view (Figure 12.8b). It can be difficult to measure the feline caudal pulmonary arteries and veins on the DV view.</p>
<p>The pulmonary functional circulation is a low pressure system; both arteries and veins are thin-walled and easily distensible and collapsible by physiological or pathological processes. Pulmonary arteries and veins should be approximately the same size, but it is common to see arteries that are slightly larger than the veins in normal animals.</p>

<title>Normal variations</title>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Lung opacity and aeration</title>
<p>Air does not attenuate the X-ray beam; therefore, a change in the amount of pulmonary air does not directly affect lung opacity. However, secondary effects associated with lung expansion and retraction do affect the opacity of the lungs. With inspiration or lung inflation the expanding lungs:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Replace more opaque extrathoracic structures in the image</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compress the heart and the easily collapsible pulmonary vessels. These fluctuations in intrapulmonary blood content are the main reason for respiration-related differences in lung opacity (Figure 12.9).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The opacity of the lung tissue cranial and caudal to the cardiac silhouette can differ under normal conditions. Large amounts of superimposing soft tissue cranially (shoulders, cranial mediastinum) can make the lungs appear more opaque in this location. Conversely, expiratory views may reveal more opaque caudal lung tissue. Due to the larger amount of lung tissue caudally, and the mobility of the diaphragm, respiratory changes have a higher net result on opacification in this location.</p>
<p>Lung tissue in the mid-thorax can be difficult to evaluate due to the superimposition of the cardiac silhouette. However, the ventral pleural margin can often be identified as a curtain-like structure over the ventral aspect of the cardiac silhouette, and can be used as a landmark (Figure 12.10).</p>
<p>Only a fraction of the normal lung capacity is needed in a normal dog and cat at rest. Consequently, the lungs are often not fully expanded and partial collapse occurs (Figure 12.10). Collapse occurs preferentially at the lung periphery and in the dependent part of the animal. Collapsed lung becomes a soft tissue opacity and radiographically visible if:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A large enough area of lung has completely collapsed</p></list-item>

<p>The lungs are expanded, separating the cardiac and diaphragmatic silhouettes and opening the lumbodiaphragmatic recess beyond the thirteenth thoracic vertebra. Cardiovascular structures appear relatively small. The net result is relatively radiolucent lung tissue. (b) Lateral thoracic radiograph obtained during the expiratory pause. Due to lung retraction, the cardiac and diaphragmatic silhouettes overlap, the lumbodiaphragmatic recess only extends to the twelfth thoracic vertebra, and the cardiovascular structures appear bigger. The resulting lung opacity is markedly increased, yet it is normal for this phase of respiration.</p>

<p>Cranial and caudal lung margins (red lines) extend to the ventral thoracic boundaries. The mid section of the lung only extends to the level of the ventral aspect of the cardiac silhouette with a wavy margin (blue line). This is a sign of normal incomplete lung lobe inflation with or without peripheral lung collapse.</p>
</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_247"/>A large area of incomplete collapse may create only a generalized subtle increase in overall opacity, insufficient to outline the collapsed lung. Physiological lung collapse is a diagnostic problem because:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Radiographically visible collapsed lung is difficult to distinguish from lung pathology</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collapsed lung silhouettes with potential soft tissue lesions.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>To minimize the effect of lung collapse it is therefore useful to obtain lateral radiographs in both left and right recumbency. On a right lateral view, the non-dependent left lung is more aerated and hence easier to interpret. On a left lateral view, the non-dependent right lung is more aerated and hence easier to interpret. This is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon but rather a gradual one. It would not be correct to assume that all radiolucent areas must belong to the non-dependent lung and all radiopaque areas to the dependent lung. However, by comparing both views it can usually be established whether a lung area with soft tissue opacity is more likely to be a dependency-related lung collapse (less opaque in non-dependent position) or a pathological lung lesion (equally or more opaque in non-dependent position). An additional DV/VD view can prove extremely helpful (lung opacity, mediastinal shift) to confirm or refute the radiographic diagnosis.</p>
<p>General anaesthesia promotes lung collapse. It is associated with prolonged recumbency and shallow breathing, and less lung tissue is needed for gas exchange (complete rest, ventilation with oxygen rather than air). Thoracic radiography should therefore be avoided during general anaesthesia and be scheduled before or after the procedure instead. Alternatively, the lungs can be inflated and radiographed in a state of maximal expansion. Manual bag holding is necessary for this technique, which requires appropriate shielding of personnel.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Age and breed variations</title>
<p>Puppies and kittens often have more opaque lungs than adults, which is probably due to an increased water content of the interstitial lung parenchyma and the presence of a thymus (Figure 12.11).</p>
<fig id="fig12_11">

<p>The lung opacity is relatively high for the size of the animal but normal for its age and expiratory phase.</p>
</fig>
<p>Linear (and much less commonly nodular) markings of interstitial origin increase the overall lung opacity in normal old dogs. This should not be misinterpreted as abnormal. Bronchial markings can be more prominent in older dogs and cats, without being associated with current bronchial disease. Heterotopic bone (also known as pulmonary osteomas, pneumoliths or pleural plaques) can form in the lungs and pleura of skeletally mature dogs, and be radiographically visible as small (1&#x2013;4 mm) nodules of mineral opacity (Figure 12.12). They are particularly common in Collie breeds. They should not be mistaken for metastatic lung lesions. Similarly sized metastases would not be sufficiently opaque to be radiographically visible (with the rare exception of mineralized metastases and miliary lung lesions).</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Species differences</title>
<p>Cranial lung expansion (cranial to the first ribs) is more pronounced in dogs. The feline lung commonly extends further caudally than the canine lung (at peak inspiration to the level of T12&#x2013;13 in dogs, and L1&#x2013;2 in cats).</p>
<p>In dogs, the dorsal lung margins are completely superimposed on the ventral aspect of the thoracolumbar spine. In cats, the caudodorsal lung margin is separated from the spine by the psoas minor muscle, which originates at the ventral surface of the last two thoracic vertebrae (the last thoracic vertebra in the dog) (Figure 12.13).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Body condition</title>
<p>Obese animals have large amounts of fat around and within the thoracic cavity, which leads to increased X-ray attenuation and generation of scatter radiation. The net result is an increased lung opacity (Figure 12.14) with poor visibility of the bronchovascular structures. Intrathoracic fat restricts full lung expansion during inspiration, which also contributes to the more opaque appearance of the lungs in these animals. These changes should not be mistaken for pathologically increased lung opacity.</p>

<p>The lungs are hyperlucent and the pulmonary vessels and cardiac silhouette are small (vertebral heart score 7). The lung fields are enlarged. The diaphragmatic silhouette is deviated far caudally from the cardiac silhouette and appears flattened. The caudodorsal lung margins open the lumbodiaphragmatic recess and extend caudally to the level of L2. The barely visible caudal vena cava (between arrowheads) is small. The stomach is gas-distended (aerophagia). If the lungs remain hyperlucent and enlarged at expiration, air trapping is a likely cause, consistent with bronchiolar disease.</p>

<title>Lung patterns</title>
<p>A radiographic pattern is a descriptive term to characterize a regionally or diffusely distributed disease. Lung patterns are an attempt to correlate imaging features of increased lung opacity with the morphological correlate of the lung (Figure 12.18):

<p>If only one component is pathologically altered, pattern recognition allows a relatively short list of differential diagnoses. In most lung diseases, more than one component is pathologically altered and a mixed pattern is evident radiographically.

<p>The right lung is homogenously opacified to a similar degree as the soft tissue organs, such as the heart and liver.

Both the cardiac silhouette and the right hemidiaphragm are partially obliterated by the lung (border obliteration sign). These are all classic features of the alveolar lung pattern.

Recommendations and limitations for use of the interstitial lung pattern include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_257"/>Should only be used in a well inflated lung</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Should only be used as a last resort when other patterns do not fit</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Subdivision into unstructured and fine-structured pattern is not helpful</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Silhouetting of small lung vessels with the lung excludes interstitial pattern and indicates alveolar pattern.</p></list-item>

<title>Prioritizing the differential diagnosis</title>
<p>Prioritization is an essential last step to establish a <italic>meaningful</italic> diagnosis. Hedging behind endless lists of differential diagnoses does not help the treatment and prognosis of the patient. A definitive diagnosis should be stated clearly whenever possible or when one disease is much more likely than others; for example, a cranioventral air space pattern in a coughing dog with megaoesophagus and fever is most likely to be due to aspiration pneumonia. Other differentials can be thought of (e.g. coincidental pulmonary haemorrhage) but are no more common than chance, i.e. unrelated to the radiographic feature (e.g. patient could coincidentally also have a brain tumour).</p>
<p>In most circumstances, there are several likely diseases that could cause a similar radiographic pattern. In this situation, the list of possibilities should be kept reasonably short and be prioritized by incorporating knowledge of test accuracy and prior probability of disease, which is best estimated by knowing the patient&#x2019;s signalment (age, sex and breed), chief complaint and pertinent history or findings. This may be the most influential step in the process of making an accurate radiographic diagnosis.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, a very large number of diseases could create a similar radiographic pattern. In this situation a differential list would be very long and could not be prioritized, and is therefore not useful. It is then sufficient to say that pulmonary disease is present but the cause is not determined.</p>

<title>Solid pulmonary masses</title>
<p>A pulmonary mass is a fluid, soft tissue or mineralized structure replacing, compressing or displacing the air-filled portion of the lung (Figure 12.37). The clinical implications rest on the assessment of whether the mass is benign or malignant. It can be difficult to differentiate between various types of lung mass solely on imaging features; however, a prioritized differential diagnoses list can be created based on the imaging characteristics described below and other factors, such as:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Age</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Species and breed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Geographical area where animal lives or has travelled to</p></list-item>

<p>Cystic masses are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Thoracic radiography is usually the initial examination. Radiographically, a pulmonary mass is evident as a discrete opacity, surrounded by (more) lucent lung. Most pulmonary masses are expansile and displace, rather than contain, major airway structures (Figure 12.38). Common features of such masses are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Bronchial deviation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Absence of air bronchograms.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>

<graphic xlink:href="fig12_38.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The mass slightly deviates the air-filled left cranial lung lobar bronchus but does not give rise to an air bronchogram. This indicates that the mass is of an expansile rather than infiltrative nature. (b) CT image confirms how the mass abuts but does not encroach into the bronchus. (Courtesy of L. Jarrett)</p>
</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_261"/>However, a minority of lung masses are infiltrative and can contain and occlude bronchi (Figure 12.39).</p>
<p>Both types of mass can result in bronchial obstruction and subsequent pulmonary atelectasis or secondary haemorrhage and infection, which can result in:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A large area of alveolar lung disease with air bronchograms and a lobar sign</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Border obliteration between the mass and the adjacent secondary lung changes, making size assessment difficult.</p></list-item>

<p>The mass occupies a large portion of the lobe, giving rise to a lobar sign cranially and caudally, and contains air bronchograms. This is consistent with an infiltrative lesion encroaching on the airways. (b) Caudal close-up of a VD thoracic radiograph of a 12-year-old Domestic Shorthair cat with nasal and pulmonary lymphoma.

It may be cavitary, if it contains gas, either due to gas-producing bacteria or due to connection with the airways (Figure 12.45). It may be surrounded by abnormal, consolidated lung, or may be well demarcated and surrounded by normal lung. Horizontal beam radiographs may demonstrate a fluid&#x2013;gas interface. It is not commonly associated with pleural effusion.</p>

<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>CT is very helpful to confirm the pulmonary origin of a mass seen on radiographs and to determine accurately its extension and any involvement of the surrounding structures, especially when surgical resection is considered (see Figures 12.38b, 12.52 and 12.53). CT may be able to confirm the presence of a solid mass lesion which is not clearly evident on radiographs due to the superimposition of an adjacent alveolar infiltrate (representing secondary oedema, inflammation or tumour extension) on the mass. CT enables detection of smaller nodules than those identified radiographically and may reveal additional lesions, such as metastatic disease and lymphadenopathy.</p>
<p>CT can be very helpful to obtain a guided aspirate of a lesion, when the presence of aerated lung peripheral to the lesion prevents an ultrasound-guided biopsy (see Figure 3.7, p. 69). Pneumothorax and haemorrhage are common complications of this procedure, but they are rarely clinically evident or significant.</p>

<title>Metastatic lung disease</title>
<p>Radiography is the screening tool for metastatic lung disease in cases of known or suspected primary neoplasia anywhere in the body. Since radiography is such a simple, fast, non-invasive and inexpensive test, even screening of patients with a relatively low risk of neoplasia is still useful if other complex, time-consuming, invasive and expensive diagnostic tests or interventions are anticipated. Most pulmonary metastases manifest as lung nodules. These need to be differentiated from benign nodular lesions (granulomatous, incidental osteomas) and end-on vessels (see Nodular interstitial lung pattern and Solid pulmonary masses).</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Thoracic radiography has a relatively low sensitivity to pulmonary metastases. A pulmonary soft tissue nodule must be 3&#x2013;5 mm in size to be visible. Nodules smaller than this may be visible if multiple nodules summate with each other, or if the nodule is mineralized. Pulmonary metastases rarely mineralize; however, a clearly visible nodule smaller than 3&#x2013;5 mm is most likely to represent an end-on vessel or an incidental mineralized nodule (heterotopic bone, granuloma).</p>
<p>Nodules are more detectable if surrounded by well inflated lucent lung, with maximal contrast between the lesion and the normal lung. Inspiratory, opposite lateral views are therefore essential, since on each view the lung on the dependent side is incompletely inflated, and metastases in that lung could be missed. It is not uncommon that nodules identified on one or both lateral films are not visible on VD/DV views. If a nodule is visible only on one view, this should not lead to dismissal of a lesion.</p>
<p>When a nodule is identified superimposed on the lung fields, an extrapulmonary location, such as the skin (mass, nipple, tick) or mediastinum, should be ruled out by evaluating an orthogonal view and by careful examination of the body wall of the patient. An extrapulmonary location should be suspected if a nodule or mass appears very opaque for its size. This is due to the increased contrast provided by the surrounding air outside the body. While identification of a nodule on two orthogonal views confirms the intrapulmonary location of a lesion with a high degree of certainty, it is often impossible to visualize a nodule on both views, even if real.</p>
<p>The most characteristic radiographic appearance of pulmonary metastatic disease is the presence of well defined soft tissue opacity nodules of variable size throughout the lung fields (see Figures 12.31 and 12.54).</p>

The bulla wall is created by connective lung tissue and visceral pleura, and this defines the bulla type (Figure 12.62). Pulmonary bullae can also be classified according to their origin as:

<caption><title>Pneumothorax and bullae/blebs</title></caption>
<p>A search for pulmonary bullae/blebs is a common procedure to identify the cause of a pneumothorax. Pneumothorax can hinder or promote visibility of a bulla, depending on the amount of free air, degree of collapse and location of the bulla. Pre- and post-thoracocentesis radiographs are recommended. CT is the modality of choice for the detection of leaking bullous lesions in pneumothorax.</p>
<p>Ruptured bullae/blebs have a tendency to collapse. Identified bullae/blebs are suggestive of the general cause of the pneumothorax (ruptured lung tissue) but the leaking collapsed bullae/blebs may not be visible.</p>
<p>Superficial blebs are more prone to rupture than deep parenchymal bullae. This should be weighted in the decision-making for conservative/surgical treatment of pneumothorax. It may not be safe to release a patient with a large bleb, despite successful drainage of the pneumothorax.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_272"/>Typical radiographic features of bullae/blebs are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Radiolucent structure with an absent or barely perceptible wall (Figure 12.64a)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bullae are usually round and within the lung parenchyma</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blebs are often ovoid and always peripheral (Figure 12.64b).</p></list-item>

</p>
<p>Secondarily infected or haemorrhagic bullae may appear as circular soft tissue opacities with areas of hyperlucency, and may mimic cavitating lung lesions or soft tissue masses (Figure 12.65). Horizontal beam radiography can help in outlining a fluid line in cysts or infected bullae.</p>

<title>Pulmonary emphysema</title>
<p>Pulmonary emphysema is characterized by an abnormal increase in the size of the alveolar air spaces due to destruction of the alveolar walls. It may be associated with bronchiolar obstruction with a valve mechanism (dynamic collapse):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Inspired air enters the pulmonary parenchyma but is unable to escape even with forced expiration (air trapping)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased expiratory intra-alveolar pressure leads to laceration of the alveolar walls and bulla formation.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>It is usually confined to the lung periphery. Clinically manifesting lung emphysema is rare in dogs and cats. It is important not to confuse air trapping with forced inspiration or pneumothorax.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Congenital lobar emphysema</title>
<p>This is a rarely reported congenital bronchial cartilage abnormality or bronchial plug in puppies, leading to dynamic airway collapse and air trapping (see Figure 8.18b, p. 185). Usually only one lung or lobe is affected, but there may be tension collapse of other lobes. It has been reported in Shih Tzu, Jack Russell Terrier, Basset Hound and Pekingese puppies. Single bullous lesions without widespread emphysema can also be congenital in origin.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Acquired pulmonary emphysema</title>
<p>Obstructive bronchiolar disease (chronic bronchitis, feline asthma, bronchial neoplasia, bronchial foreign body) can lead to dynamic airway collapse and air trapping. Chronic compensatory hyperinflation has been reported to cause lobar emphysema. Mild changes are commonly seen in cats with asthma; marked changes are rarely seen in dogs or cats. Changes are usually bilateral.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographs should be taken on both full inspiration and expiration. Emphysema is confirmed if there is no difference between inspiration and expiration in the position of the diaphragm or pulmonary radiolucency. A horizontal beam DV/VD view can be useful, as the dependent lung lobe does not collapse with lobar emphysema.</p>

<title>Lung lobe torsion </title>
<p>Lung lobe torsion is an uncommon condition in small animals, but it is potentially life-threatening and requires surgical intervention in most cases.</p>
<p>Rotation of a lung lobe occurs around its axis, usually close to the hilus or rarely also in the middle of a lobe:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>This leads to twisting and occlusion of the bronchovascular structures</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Venous return and lymphatic drainage from the lung lobe are compromised, whereas arterial supply is preserved initially to some degree due to the stronger muscular arterial walls</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This leads to venous congestion, pulmonary oedema, sequestration of blood within the twisted lung lobe and eventually lung lobe necrosis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blood and fluid enter the alveoli and distal bronchi. </p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Air can be trapped within the twisted lung lobe due to incomplete bronchial obstruction with a one-way valve effect. Pulmonary emphysema can develop as a consequence of increased alveolar pressure, alveolar or bronchial tears; pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can result from bronchial tears.</p>
<p>Decreased lymphatic drainage, as well as increased interstitial and hydrostatic pressure within the affected lung lobe, leads to production of pleural effusion.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The effusion initially presents as a transudate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It later becomes haemorrhagic or suppurative. </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Necrosis or fibrosis in the later stages of the disease lead to a decrease in lung lobe volume. </p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_277"/>Large-breed dogs with deep and narrow chests, particularly Afghan hounds, are predisposed. Small chondrodystrophic dogs with round chests, such as Pugs, have also been described with spontaneous lung lobe torsion. Small dogs and cats are more commonly reported to have an underlying condition, leading to the lung lobe torsion.</p>
<p>Underlying diseases are characterized by collapse of a lung lobe, which is also suspended in either pleural fluid or air, leading to increased lung lobe mobility. Pleural effusion, pneumothorax, trauma with compression of the thoracic cavity and partial collapse of a lung lobe, but also pneumonia and surgical manipulation, are described as predisposing conditions.</p>
<p>The most commonly affected lung lobes are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Right middle lung lobe (most common in deep-chested dogs)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Left cranial lung lobe, the entire lobe or the cranial part (most common in small, chondrodystrophic breeds).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>All other lung lobes can be affected, and more than one lung lobe can be affected. Mid-lobar torsions are possible. Recurring lung lobe torsion has been described, but is unusual.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Pleural effusion is a consistent finding in patients with lung lobe torsion. The pleural effusion can be:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Bilaterally symmetrical</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Asymmetrical</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unilateral and centred around the affected lung lobe (Figure 12.73). </p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>In most cases pleural effusion is the consequence rather than the cause of the lung lobe torsion, and therefore it may be absent very early on in the disease process. However, this very early stage is rarely observed.</p>
<p>A mediastinal shift with displacement of the cardiac silhouette is sometimes present, usually away from the affected lung lobe, but can be towards a lung lobe with chronic torsion. The trachea can be dorsally deviated or have some degree of axial rotation at the level of the carina, caused by the abnormal position of the twisted lung lobe. This is best seen on a lateral radiograph (Figure 12.74).</p>

<p>Diagnosis of specific alveolar lung diseases is challenging because:

<p>The Greek word &#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x00ED;&#x03B1; means non-expansion of a terminal space.

This broad definition is synonymous with collapse and both terms are used in this manual in this sense.</p>
<p>In the normal lung, surfactant maintains lung compliance and alveolar stability. The negative pleural pressure and surfactant prevent elastic recoil and lung lobe collapse. If either of these is missing then the lung may collapse. There are different types of atelectasis:

<p>The location and degree of lung collapse depend on many factors, including:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pleural surface area:lung volume ratio: lobes or lung areas with a relatively large surface area and small volume have a higher tendency to collapse, e.g. right middle lobe and lobe apices</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collateral ventilation: a term used to describe aeration of the alveoli other than by direct airway connections. This is a major factor in preventing lobar collapse and allowing pulmonary reinflation after pneumonia. It also explains why a lobe may not collapse distal to a complete bronchial obstruction. Gas exchange occurs between lung segments via small pores and channels and airway anastomoses. A check-valve effect of pores of Kohn allows reinflation of collapsed lung areas during inspiration and prevents air escape during expiration. Collateral ventilation also promotes spread of infection throughout a lobe. Collateral ventilation is particularly effective with large pressure differences, e.g. during coughing</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is ineffective with: small pressure differences; pulmonary exudates and secretions obliterating pores and alveoli; and a high pleural surface:lung volume ratio</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gravitational effects: dependent lung areas always have a higher tendency to collapse. Non-physiological recumbency during medical procedures can put additional weight on the dependent lungs and promote collapse. Heart and mediastinal structures can exert pressure on the lungs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tidal volume: reduced activity, particularly under sedation/anaesthesia and during prolonged medical procedures, reduces the air space volume needed and promotes collapse</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inhaled gases: oxygen supplementation promotes resorption atelectasis.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<boxed-text>
<caption><title>Why is the right middle lung lobe so prone to collapse with chronic respiratory disease?</title></caption>
<p>It has a high pleural surface area:lung volume ratio, leading <break/>to less collateral ventilation. The opposite is true for the <break/>caudal lobes, which have a low pleural surface area:lung volume ratio, more collateral ventilation, and hence are unlikely to collapse.</p>

<p>This diagnosis is based upon a history of exposure to fire or smoke (Figure 12.95). There is no breed, age or sex predisposition. There is a seasonal bias, with an increased incidence in the winter months. Smoke inhalation results in a variety of pulmonary abnormalities:

<title>Acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
<p>ARDS is a human term defined as acute fulminating respiratory failure, resulting from a variety of diseases, leading to diffuse lung injury. It may also be called adult respiratory distress syndrome or shock lung.</p>
<p>ARDS is considered to be a subgroup of non-cardiogenic oedema. It is part of the systemic inflammatory response, leading to increased vascular permeability, pulmonary hypertension and airway constriction and obstruction. Inciting factors may be pulmonary (e.g. smoke inhalation, bacterial pneumonia) or non-pulmonary (e.g. endotoxaemia, pancreatitis, trauma, paraquat and other toxicities, fat embolism) in origin.</p>
<p>Histologically, ARDS is characterized by alveolar inflammation, oedema, haemorrhage, necrosis with formation of hyaline membranes or vascular congestion in conjunction with type 2 alveolar cell proliferation or interstitial fibrosis.</p>
<p>Clinical signs are acute onset of severe and progressive respiratory distress; in some cases signs are associated with an underlying cause (e.g. vomiting, evidence of trauma, etc.). Progressive tachypnoea and dyspnoea are seen in most animals with altered lung sounds.</p>

<p>Pulmonary venous embolism is uncommon in dogs and cats. Infarction is an uncommon sequel to embolic disease because:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The lungs have an extensive collateral circulation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Occlusion of central vessels results in ischaemia rather than infarction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Infarcts typically occur in lung periphery.</p></list-item>

</p>
<p>Consequences of an infarction depend upon the size and the amount of lung affected:

</list>
</p>
<p>Infarction is reported more commonly in dogs than cats. Reported predisposing causes for infarction include amyloidosis, pancreatitis, immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, hyperadrenocorticism, dirofilariasis, neoplasia (thromboembolism) and surgical intervention with bone marrow compression (fat embolism). Renal disease is the most commonly identified underlying cause. Clinical signs include acute onset dyspnoea. Septic emboli may lead to multiple abscessation or pneumonia. Neoplastic emboli may lead to atypical seeding of a metastatic tumour. For more information on pulmonary vascular embolic events and lung infarction, see Chapter 7.</p>

<title>Pulmonary contusion and laceration</title>
<p>Blunt external thoracic trauma is the most common cause of traumatic lung changes in dogs and cats, commonly seen in road traffic accidents and high rise syndrome (Figure 12.105).</p>
<p>Blunt internal thoracic trauma (barotrauma) is a relatively common cause of lung laceration in cats; for example, following iatrogenic manual or automated hyperinflation of lungs during anaesthesia. It can cause pneumomediastinum, pneumo- or haemothorax, but does not cause widespread contusion.</p>

<title>Pneumonia</title>
<p>Pneumonia is defined as inflammation of the alveolar parenchyma. The term pneumonia has been used to describe acute and exudative inflammation, and pneumonitis is used to describe chronic proliferative lesions. Regardless of the aetiology, the clinical signs and radiographic features of pneumonia are often similar. In this chapter pneumonias are classified first according to the initial site of involvement and the spread of infection, which can be documented radiographically. The characteristic radiographic findings caused by specific pathological agents are discussed following this classification.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Bronchopneumonia &#x2013; originates at the bronchoalveolar junction. Often acute in onset and infectious in origin. Usually cranioventral in distribution and due to an aerogenous origin. Bacterial causes are most common, often secondary to other lung insult, and result in suppurative pneumonia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lobar pneumonia &#x2013; the entire lobe is affected; usually due to fulminating bronchopneumonia, less commonly due to a tracheobronchial foreign body.</p></list-item>

<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Non-specific canine bacterial pneumonia:</title>
<p>This is the most common cause of pneumonia and often develops as a secondary infection following primary lung insult (e.g. haemorrhage, viral infection). Bronchopneumonia is the most common pathology and is thought to be due to an aerogenous infection. The cranial and middle lung lobes are preferentially affected due to the inherent vulnerability of the bronchoalveolar junction and gravitational effects. In haematogenous infections, the caudal lung lobes may be more severely affected. Involvement of the entire lobe is often seen as extensive collateral ventilation allows rapid spread of infection (lobar pneumonia). Clinical signs are variable but often include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Soft cough with increased respiratory effort</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Anorexia and lethargy</p></list-item>

<title>Aspiration and fistulous pneumonia:</title>
<p>This is caused by pulmonary intake of large particles or fluid. Aspiration of small quantities of oral contents is common and does not cause problems if there are normal respiratory defence mechanisms. Barium is commonly aspirated if orally fed for alimentary contrast studies; small to medium amounts are well tolerated by animals, but resorption by tributary lymph nodes can take months to years. See Lipid pneumonia (below) for details about oil or milk aspiration.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_301"/>With defective mucociliary clearance, immunodeficiency or aspiration of large quantities of infective material, aspiration pneumonia may develop. Gastric contents cause chemical damage to the airways and resultant airway constriction and oedema. This may be followed by secondary bacterial infection and development of ARDS. Airway obstruction or constriction may occur.</p>
<p>Aspiration usually affects the cranial and ventral aspect of the lungs, unless the animal aspirated whilst anaesthetized or recumbent when any part of the lung may be affected. Aspiration is common with any condition causing megaoesophagus and dysphagia, and is most commonly seen in the right middle lobe. Clinical signs include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Acute dyspnoea within 2 hours of aspiration; may be longer if particulate material, e.g. food</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Coughing, tachypnoea, wheezing and cyanosis.</p></list-item>

<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Radiographs are normal in the initial stages but develop abnormalities within 12&#x2013;36 hours. In cases of particulate aspiration, radiographic changes may take longer to appear and disappear.

<title>Pulmonary neoplasia</title>
<p>Neoplastic causes of the alveolar pattern may be due to extension of the tumour into the alveoli, bronchial obstruction or inflammatory reaction to the tumour. An alveolar pattern may be seen with both primary and, less commonly, secondary pulmonary neoplasia.</p>
<p>Neoplastic alveolar disease is chronic and does not resolve with standard antimicrobial treatment (see Figure 12.81cd). The lack of short-term temporal evolution helps differentiate it from the more common acute alveolar diseases.</p>
<p>Primary lung tumours frequently cause lobar consolidation either due to obstruction of a bronchus or direct invasion of the lobe, but usually affect single lobes. Air bronchograms are uncommon, in contrast to acute alveolar disease, as the bronchi are often filled by tumour tissue or displaced by it. Lymphoma and some bronchoalveolar tumours grow around the airways, so may result in air bronchograms.</p>
<p>In cats, generalized or multifocal alveolar disease may be seen with primary and metastatic tumours. Neoplasia should be suspected if there is enlargement of an affected lobe, particularly in older animals.</p>

<title>Predominantly interstitial lung diseases</title>
<p>The pulmonary interstitium consists of the subserosal lung capsule and a network of fibroblasts, collagen and elastic fibres covering the alveolar membranes, airways and vessels. Dogs and cats lack interstitial septae between the lung lobes. The interstitium has a trophic and immunoprotective function, provides a mechanical framework for the alveoli, airways and vessels, and is responsible for the elastic recoil of the lung. Diseases that affect the interstitium often change the pulmonary compliance (see Figure 12.15):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Destruction of the elastic fibre network results in an abnormally <italic>high</italic> compliance, e.g. emphysema, causing distended air spaces on inspiration and expiration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interstitial proliferation results in an abnormally <italic>low</italic> compliance, e.g. interstitial fibrosis, resulting in incompletely distended air spaces on inspiration.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_312"/>The major types of pulmonary interstitial disease are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fluid accumulation causing interstitial oedema</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Infiltration with inflammatory or neoplastic cells</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chronic conditions causing collagen deposition, fibrosis and mineralization.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>All of these conditions cause thickening of the alveolar walls and peribronchial tissues, which results in an overall increased opacity of the lungs and blurring of the fine vascular structures (see Interpretive principles, above). Primarily interstitial lung diseases may be localized or diffuse, with systemic diseases often associated with diffuse pulmonary involvement. Interstitial disease can progress to an alveolar pattern if the alveoli become fluid-filled, such as in acute interstitial pneumonia or secondary pneumonia, or if the alveolar walls become markedly thickened and the alveolar sac is compressed. However, identification of an interstitial pattern can help to determine the nature of the disease process. The interstitial pulmonary pattern is a common and often non-specific radiographic sign.</p>
<p>The interstitial pattern must first be differentiated from age-associated changes and physiological causes, such as hypoinflation and obesity. Once the pattern is determined to be significant, a list of differential diagnoses can be formulated. An interstitial pattern is a stage in many disease processes, and the temporal aspect has to be considered in the radiographic interpretation.</p>
<p>All of these remarks refer to the <italic>unstructured</italic> or<italic> fine-structured interstitial pattern.</italic> The nodular pattern, which is also a form of interstitial pattern, is discussed above (see Solid pulmonary masses).</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interstitial oedema</title>
<p>Under normal conditions, there is fluid flux from the pulmonary capillaries through small gaps between the endothelial cells into the interstitium, and drainage from the interstitial space by lymphatic vessels (see also Pulmonary oedema, above). Increased interstitial fluid production (oedema) occurs due to one or more of the following:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Increased microvascular hydrostatic pressure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reduced capillary oncotic pressure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased vascular permeability</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reduced lymphatic drainage.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The pulmonary lymphatics can increase their drainage capacity 3&#x2013;10 fold in an acute situation to prevent oedema from occurring. If this flow is exceeded fluid starts to accumulate, initially in the interstitial tissues surrounding the vessels and lymphatics. The largest amount of fluid tends to gather around the pulmonary arteries.</p>
<p>The interstitial space can expand up to twice its normal volume. When the pressure in the expanded interstitial space rises to a similar pressure to the alveolar interstitium, forward flow decreases and the alveolar interstitium starts to expand, causing alveolar wall thickening. Eventually, the alveolar walls cannot withstand the pressure and gaps or ruptures form in the alveolar epithelium. Filling of the alveoli with fluid is the alveolar stage of pulmonary oedema.</p>

<title>Interstitial pneumonia</title>
<p>Interstitial pneumonia (see also above) is caused by infiltration of inflammatory cells into the alveolar walls (sparing the airways) or by toxic exposure.

<title>Interstitial mineralization</title>
<p>Mineralization of the pulmonary parenchyma may be dystrophic, metastatic or idiopathic. Calcium and other minerals are concentrated in the mitochondria of the cell or in the vesicles in the extracellular space. Minerals are deposited as non-crystalline calcium phosphate (dystrophic), calcium carbonate salts (metastatic) or hydroxyapatite crystals (dystrophic and metastatic).</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Dystrophic mineralization:</title>
<p>This occurs with damaged or necrotic lung tissue in dogs with normal serum calcium, and with diseases of calcium metabolism, secondary to parasitic or fungal granulomas (histoplasmosis), abscessation, neoplasia or metabolic disease (hyperadrenocorticism). Diffuse inflammatory lesions that result in fibrosis, such as chronic uraemia, can also have a component of mineralization. Heterotopic bone (pulmonary osteoma) is considered a form of dystrophic mineralization. Small islands of bone matrix are deposited in the pulmonary parenchyma and mineralize. This is commonly seen in older dogs as an incidental finding. Bronchial walls commonly mineralize in dogs, but rarely do so in cats. Osteosarcomas occasionally form osteoid pulmonary metastases.</p>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing&#x2019;s disease):</title>
<p>This causes dystrophic mineralization of the soft tissues, including the skin, stomach, arteries, skeletal muscles and kidneys. Cortisol alters glucose production in the liver, and this has catabolic effects. Proteins formed in relation to these processes are altered, and may result in increased calcium binding to the organic matrix. The lungs are one of the most frequently mineralized tissues at the microscopic level; macroscopic radiographically evident mineralization is rare. Serum calcium levels are generally within normal limits.</p>
<p>If the degree of mineralization is severe, dogs may experience significant respiratory distress and be oxygen-dependent. This hypoxaemia may be due to impaired gas diffusion across the mineralized alveolar walls.</p>
</sec5>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Metastatic mineralization:</title>
<p>This is caused by altered serum calcium and phosphorus levels with deposition of minerals in the normal tissues. Causes of hypercalcaemia include primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis D, lymphosarcoma, cholecalciferol rodenticide toxicity and disseminated bone cancer, such as multiple myeloma. Tumours (e.g. anal gland carcinomas) can also produce a parathormone-like hormone, which causes hypercalcaemia as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Most instances of metastatic mineralization in the lung are visible only at the microscopic level.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Idiopathic and iatrogenic mineralization:</title>
<p>This includes pulmonary alveolar and bronchiolar microlithiasis (idiopathic) and mineralization secondary to barium aspiration (iatrogenic).</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Interstitial lung mineralization can manifest as:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_318"/>Normal appearing lung</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small nodular mineralization (heterotopic bone) (see Figure 12.33)</p></list-item>

<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Hyperadrenocorticism:</title>
<p>Radiographic findings in dogs with Cushing&#x2019;s disease are often mild and can be partially caused by artefacts. The obesity of cushingoid dogs means that a high kV setting is required to obtain the radiographs; a high kV reduces image contrast (scatter, high penetration, Compton-related low image contrast). Low image contrast can mimic an interstitial lung pattern. Body condition should, therefore, be taken into account when diagnosing interstitial disease.</p>
<p>Common radiographic findings (see Figures 12.27 and 12.142b) include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Mineralization difficult to see radiographically and usually causes an unstructured interstitial pattern</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Marked bronchial mineralization, most pronounced in the caudodorsal lung fields due to an increased volume of lung in that area</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May progress to an alveolar pattern with air bronchograms</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interstitial pattern does not resolve with diuresis (as opposed to oedema).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
</sec5>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography:</title>
<p>CT is very sensitive to changes in density, and is more sensitive than radiographs at diagnosing pulmonary mineralization (see Figure 12.59). The Hounsfield units (HU) can be measured and compared with the normal values for soft tissue and mineral to determine the presence of mineralization. Soft tissue is usually 30&#x2013;60 HU, and mineralized tissue is greater. CT is also useful in patients with hyperadrenocorticism to identify pituitary or adrenal masses.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Scintigraphy:</title>
<p>Pulmonary mineralization can be diagnosed using nuclear scintigraphy. <sup>99m</sup>Technetium-methylene diphosphonate can be injected intravenously, as for a bone scan. At the 2-hour time point, the pulmonary parenchyma will show an increased uptake of radiopharmaceutical due to binding with the hydroxyapatite crystals in the interstitium, which are similar to those in bone (Figure 12.143). This may be a useful technique if the dog has a mild interstitial pattern and it is unclear whether it is due to pulmonary oedema or diffuse mineralization.</p>

(b) Caudodorsal close-up of a lateral thoracic radiograph of a 5-year-old Dachshund with Cushing&#x2019;s disease. Diffuse interstitial and bronchial mineralization has resulted in a bronchointerstitial pattern. The bronchi and pulmonary parenchyma have a subtle mineral opacity. In most cases, interstitial mineralization is not marked enough to cause a mineral radiopacity, and the interstitial opacity is often mistaken for interstitial oedema. A persistent interstitial lung pattern, despite diuretic treatment in hyperadrenocorticoid dogs, should prompt consideration of mineralization and fibrosis as differential diagnoses.</p>
