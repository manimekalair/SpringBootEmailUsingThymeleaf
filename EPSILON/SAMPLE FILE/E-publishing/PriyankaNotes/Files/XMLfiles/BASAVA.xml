<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Thoracic radiography is an essential tool in the investigation of both thoracic and systemic disease. Radio&#x00AD;graphy remains a popular diagnostic screening tool for the thorax because:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>It is time- and cost-efficient</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It uses readily available equipment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is relatively easy to perform</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It usually does not require general anaesthesia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is non-invasive and causes relatively low stress to the patient</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is unparalleled by any other diagnostic test for these characteristics.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Despite the fact that radiography is easy to perform, careful technique is required to ensure that high-quality films are obtained. Poor technique is a common reason for misdiagnosis. The first part of this chapter outlines the methods that should be used to obtain thoracic films and special techniques to enhance their diagnostic yield.</p>
<p>Although thoracic radiographs are easily obtained, the thorax remains a very difficult region to interpret. This is due to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The effects of superimposition</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The wide range of normal anatomical and physiological variations</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wide overlap of radiographic features of physiological and pathological processes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Similar imaging features for different diseases</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lack of confirmation by other non-invasive tests.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>This leaves the clinician in a dilemma where thoracic radiographs are concerned because radio&#x00AD;graphy is the most practical test to perform, but results are difficult to interpret. The most challenging part of thoracic radiographic examination will always be the interpretation of the films. The second part of this chapter introduces some of the basic principles of thoracic radiology that apply to all anatomical regions. These are discussed in further detail in later chapters, but an early understanding of these principles will facilitate interpretation of the thoracic radiograph as a whole.</p>

<title>Indications</title>
<p>There are many indications for thoracic radiography (Figure 1.1) and these fall into two broad categories: the assessment of intrathoracic disease; and the screening and assessment of systemic disease. In general, thoracic radiography:

<title>Physical restraint and positioning aids</title>
<p>Animals presented for thoracic radiography are often afraid, in pain, dyspnoeic or all three. With considerate handling and verbal reassurance most patients can be restrained with a combination of positioning aids and sedation. The use of verbal commands such as &#x2018;sit&#x2019;, &#x2018;down&#x2019; and &#x2018;stay&#x2019; in the language the owner uses to address the dog are usually helpful. Calming words will help to reduce fear and stress. Gentle stroking of the ear during the positioning process will activate acupuncture points and further calm the animal. Gently swaying a cat from side to side in a ventrodorsal position has been advocated to disorientate the cat and keep it still for sufficient time to take an exposure. Muzzles are also useful for cats (Figure 1.2).</p>
<fig>
<label>1.2</label>
<caption><title>Fractious cats can be difficult to restrain while conscious.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>A cat muzzle is often extremely useful and many cats can be positioned using tape and sandbags once this is applied.</p>
</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>The following are commonly employed as positioning aids:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Sandbags (Figure 1.3)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Troughs or bean bags</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Foam wedges</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ties and tape.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<fig>
<label>1.3</label>
<caption><title>Many positioning aids are available.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>Sandbags should be heavy enough to provide adequate restraint. The internal sand or beans should be shifted to either end to avoid airway compromise.</p>
</fig>
<p>In very young kittens and puppies, the use of an atraumatic clip on the back of the neck will some&#x00AD;times keep the animal still whilst in lateral recumbency (mimicking the animal being carried by the queen/bitch).</p>
<p>It is important to realize that trying to obtain thoracic radiographs may occasionally be <italic>fatal</italic> in animals with severe thoracic disease:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Consider whether it is essential to take radiographs at this time. Do the benefits outweigh the risks? Will it change your treatment plan? Would it be safer to stabilize the patient before obtaining radiographs?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consider which views are safest to obtain in your patient (see Standard radiographic views, below)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consider placing a dyspnoeic cat in a cardboard box to obtain a screening dorsoventral (DV) view (Figure 1.4). This entails minimal restraint or intervention and should keep the cat calmer.</p></list-item>
</list></p>

<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
</fig>
<p>If a thoracic radiograph is considered essential in a stressed cat or small dog then a screening DV radiograph can be obtained through a cardboard box. The lid can be closed (provide airholes or oxygen supply) for further calming effect.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Manual restraint</title>
<p>In the UK the law provides strict guidelines on restraint for small animal radiography:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>No animal should be held for radiography unless there are good clinical indications why they cannot be restrained by other means. The use of anaesthesia or sedation and positioning aids should always be considered before recourse to manual restraint</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Manual restraint should only be used in exceptional circumstances and should not be permitted unless the X-ray machine is fitted with a light beam diaphragm.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In certain other countries regulations are more lenient; however, radiation protection should be considered paramount no matter what the legal requirements.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A maximal distance from the primary beam should be maintained.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Two people may be required so that each is as far away from the primary beam as possible (Figure 1.5).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Appropriate personal dosimetry devices must be used.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Appropriate personal protection, such as lead gowns, gloves and thyroid protectors, should be employed. These items should be stored properly and checked on a regular basis to ensure continued protection.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pregnant women and persons under the age of 18 should not be present.</p></list-item>
</list>

<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>Two people may be required to hold the animal in order that each is a maximal distance from the primary beam. Protective clothing and personal dosimeters must be worn.</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Chemical restraint</title>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Sedation:</title>
<p>This is highly recommended for thoracic radiography unless contraindicated by the clinical condition of the patient. Sedatives have a calming effect and induce drowsiness, making the animal more amenable to handling. The level of sedation should depend upon the demeanour and general health of the animal. Quiet surroundings are essential for sedation to take effect, not only immediately after administration but during the radiographic procedure as well. If the animal is in pain, sedation will not occur unless analgesics are also administered. The reader is referred to the <italic>BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Anaesthesia and Analgesia</italic> for appropriate sedative dosages and combinations.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>Anaesthesia:</title>
<p>This is not usually required for a stan&#x00AD;dard radiographic procedure. Anaesthetic-induced changes, such as atelectasis, hinder interpretation and therefore it is advisable to avoid general anaesthesia when obtaining thoracic films. However, anaesthesia may be required in difficult patients to obtain appropriate and diagnostic-quality radiographs.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The clinical condition of the patient should be taken into account before considering anaesthesia. Intubation and intravenous access are recommended.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Repeated gentle inflation prior to obtaining radiographs and use of different body positions may assist in preventing or resolving atelectatic change to some degree.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The use of anaesthesia for screening for pulmonary metastases is controversial. Some radiologists prefer inspiratory radiographs in non-anaesthetized patients and others advocate inflated radiographs under general anaesthesia. If inflated radiographs are obtained under anaesthesia, then the exposure factors must be reduced and great care must be taken to avoid or resolve atelectasis. Consideration must also be given to protective clothing and dosimetry for personnel.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The reader is referred to the <italic>BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Anaesthesia and Analgesia</italic> for appropriate anaesthetic protocols.</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Technique</title>
<p>Radiographic technique is summarized in Figure 1.6.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Intensifying screens</title>
<p>Screens decrease the patient dose due to their ability to convert few absorbed X-ray photons into many light photons. This X-ray to light conversion efficiency is highest in the <italic>rare earth screens</italic>. The speed of a screen and its ability to record detail are in a reciprocal relationship; the faster the screen, the less detail it records. Screens allow the use of short exposure times and therefore reduce the likelihood of motion artefacts; the faster the screen, the shorter the exposure time. To balance speed and recorded detail, a <italic>medium-speed</italic> screen should be used in most situations for thoracic radiography.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Film</title>
<p>Most film has photosensitive emulsion on both sides (&#x2018;double-sided emulsion&#x2019;). The emulsion contains the light-sensitive crystals, and the size of the grains determines the speed of the film and its sensitivity to light. The film is wedged between two intensifying screens within the cassette, and it has to be sensitive to the type of light emitted by the screens.</p>
<p><italic>Medium-speed film</italic> in association with medium-speed screens will usually result in a good thoracic radiographic image. The safelight in the darkroom has to be matched to the sensitivity spectrum of the film: amber light for blue and red light for blue/green sensitive films.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Exposure</title>
<p>An exposure chart should be employed to optimize the radiographic result. General principles for thoracic radiography are as follows:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>High kilovoltage (kV)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Low milliampereseconds (mAs):
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>High mA</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Short exposure times.</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The kV dictates the energy of each photon (the <italic>quality</italic> of the X-ray beam) and the mAs dictates the number of photons emitted (the <italic>quantity</italic> of X-ray photons in the beam). A high kV is used in thoracic radiography as it gives a low-contrast image with a wide range of tones of grey, enabling better evaluation of lung detail. This effect occurs with a high kV due to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The high degree of penetration of the beam</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The predominance of the Compton effect</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The presence of scatter (undesirable).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Since both kV and mAs contribute to film blackening, the high kV is compensated for by a low mAs. An important additional reason to keep the mAs low is to limit exposure time, thereby avoiding motion unsharpness due to respiratory movements.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Centring, collimation and use of grids</title>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Centring:</title>
<p>Careful centring is important. This allows accurate collimation to the area under investigation, which in turn decreases scatter.</p>
<table-1.6/>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>Collimation:</title>
<p>A light beam is used to show the centre and exact configuration of the X-ray field. The X-ray beam is confined to the area of the body under investigation, which limits scatter formation in neighbouring tissue. The amount of scattered radiation produced by the area under investigation also depends on the thickness of the part being examined and the kV used.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Grids:</title>
<p>A thorax thicker than 10 cm should be radiographed with a grid to reduce the effect of scattered radiation on the film. A grid gives improved film contrast. Grids absorb multidirectional X-rays (scatter) <italic>and</italic> part of the primary beam, so exposure factors must therefore be increased slightly when using a grid. A moving grid (Potter-Bucky) will eliminate grid lines from the final radiograph.</p>
<p>Whichever type of grid is used it is important to be aware that improper use will lead to artefacts (such as grid cut-off) and a compromised final image.</p>
</sec4>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Inspiration or expiration?</title>
<p>The exposure should generally be made at the end of the inspiratory phase, when the lungs are fully expanded. Radiographs taken at end-expiration show a pulmonary opacity that approaches that of a pathological infiltrate. Inspiratory and expiratory views can be useful together to evaluate dynamic changes in the lung and trachea.</p>
<p>End-expiratory views are advisable in certain situations, for example:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In the diagnosis of small amounts of pleural fluid or gas (see Chapter 13)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the identification of pulmonary fibrosis when the degree of lung expansion is compared on both inspiratory and expiratory views (see Chapter 12).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Standard radiographic views</title>
<p>Radiographic views should be referred to by the entrance and exit points of the X-ray beam through the patient. For example the term &#x2018;ventrodorsal&#x2019; means that the beam entered the ventral aspect of the patient and exited the dorsal aspect of the patient. The exit point of the X-ray beam is also assumed to be synonymous with the side of recumbency of the patient. For example, the term ventrodorsal also implies that the animal was lying on its back when the radiograph was obtained.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking a lateral view obtained with the patient in left lateral recumbency (left side next to the table) should be referred to as a &#x2018;right lateral to left lateral&#x2019; view. This terminology is unwieldy in practical situations, hence lateral views are commonly described only by the recumbent side:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Patient in left lateral recumbency = left lateral</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patient in right lateral recumbency = right lateral.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>A complete radiographic evaluation of all thoracic organs, but in particular the lungs, requires three views: two opposite lateral views and one ventrodorsal (VD) or DV view. A set of two orthogonal views can be regarded as a minimal standard for a routine thoracic examination. A single radiographic view will provide significantly less information than a two- or three-view study, but may be appropriate if the clinical condition of the patient dictates brevity of the examination. It should be kept in mind that radiography is a screening procedure. Choosing a single radiographic view to monitor a known condition may result in loss of information about unexpected pathology.</p>
<p>The minimum views that should be obtained in different clinical situations are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Right lateral and DV views for cardiac conditions</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Right lateral and VD views for lung pathology (especially assessment of the accessory lobe)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Left lateral, right lateral and VD views for pulmonary metastases (see Chapter 12).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Lateral views:</title>
<p>The right and left lateral views look different, provide different information and therefore both should be obtained (see Chapters 8 and 12). However, if the examination is limited to only one lateral view then the right lateral is usually preferable because:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The diaphragm obscures less of the caudodorsal lung field</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The heart is in a more consistent position due to the cardiac notch of the lungs on the right side</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In inflated views of the chest, the right middle lobe will project itself between the heart and the sternum, resulting in better cardiac detail</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An enlargement of the sternal lymph node is more easily identified.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p><italic>Technique for lateral recumbent views:</italic>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Position the animal in right or left lateral recumbency.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Place a sandbag over the neck with the sand distributed to either end of the bag so as not to obstruct the airway (Figure 1.7).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gently pull the forelimbs forward and hold in place with sandbags or ties to avoid superimposition of the triceps muscles over the cranial lung lobes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>Position a second sandbag over the hindquarters or wrap around the hindlimbs to ensure the animal remains in the required position.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gently extend the head and neck to avoid positional variation of the trachea.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The sternum and vertebrae should be level with each other. This can be achieved by positioning a foam wedge under the sternum to elevate it to the required level (Figure 1.8). Barrel-chested dogs, such as English Bull Terriers, may require the foam wedge under the spine.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Centre the beam at the caudal aspect of the scapula and two-thirds of this distance down the chest (Figure 1.9).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collimation should include the thoracic inlet and whole diaphragm (including part of the liver). Ventrally the sternum should be included. A common mistake is to extend dorsal collimation to the most dorsal skin surface of the animal. This is unnecessary, as inclusion of the spine will be sufficient to evaluate the entire dorsal lung fields.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Include a positional marker (right or left) in the collimated area.</p></list-item>

<title>Dorsoventral and ventrodorsal views:</title>
<p>DV and VD radiographs are rarely both needed but each view has its advantages and disadvantages. On DV views the cardiac silhouette assumes a more standard appearance, is less magnified, and the caudal pulmonary arteries and veins are more easily identified surrounded by a gas-filled lung; this view is therefore often preferred in animals with heart disease. VD views are generally considered more useful for evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma. There may be some situations where it is beneficial to obtain one or both views, and this is discussed in the relevant chapters. One of the most important technical aspects of any VD or DV view is to acquire it with the animal in a perfectly straight position (Figure 1.10). In sedated animals without manual restraint this is often most easily achieved with a DV view (natural sternal recumbency). However, in some deep-chested animals (such as the Afghan Hound) a straight VD view will be easier to obtain.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the DV view is always preferable for animals in respiratory distress. This is a position the animal itself would assume as it allows:

<list-item><p>Full expansion of the rib cage during inspiration</p></list-item>

<title>Decubitus view or horizontal beam VD/DV view:</title>
<p>This is indicated in the detection of a small pneumo&#x00AD;thorax and small amounts of pleural effusion, and is also useful to skyline thoracic wall lesions.

<title>Horizontal beam standing view:</title>
<p>This view is indicated in animals with severe respiratory compromise that cannot be positioned in lateral recumbency to obtain a lateral view (Figure 1.15). It is a useful position for the detection of pneumothorax, pleural effusion and gas&#x2013;fluid interfaces of cysts or abscesses. This position, however, is less sensitive for the detection of small amounts of pleural effusion when compared with the decubitus lateral view described above. A similar view can also be achieved with the animal in sternal recumbency or in a sitting position. It may be easier to extend the front legs more adequately in sternal recumbency than in a standing position.</p>

<title>Digital radiography</title>
<p>Two types of digital radiography exist: computed radiography (CR) and, more recently, direct radio&#x00AD;graphy (DR). The method of detecting and processing the image in both CR and DR is completely different to that used in film&#x2013;screen radiography. Digital radiography will become increasingly prevalent in clinical and radiographic practice over the next few years. It is important to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages that these modalities will bring.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Principles of computed radiography</title>
<p>CR uses a specialized cassette (imaging plate) and image reading device (Figure 1.17). The cassette does not contain a film wedged between two intensifying screens but rather a photostimulable phosphor plate. CR can be used with the existing X-ray tube, generator and table top.</p>
<p>The phosphor absorbs the X-ray energy and keeps it for a period of time. The exposed cassette is fed into the image reading device and a laser is used to release the stored energy in the form of luminescent light. A photomultiplier transforms the light into electrical signals where the different light intensities result in a digital picture. Once the plate <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>is read, the information on it is erased by white light to prepare it for the next exposure. The digital image can now be manipulated or post-processed using a computer (Figure 1.18).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>Post-processing, such as enlargement, annotation and windowing, can be performed at this time.</p>
</fig>
<p>The image reading process usually takes about 90 seconds, but each imaging plate must be processed one at a time. It is important to tell the image reading device which algorithm to use to process the image (i.e. a skeletal radiograph will be processed very differently to a thoracic radiograph).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Principles of direct radiography</title>
<p>DR can be compared with digital photography in that an immediate image is created on a screen without a processing step. The cassette, screen and film are replaced by a digital imaging sensor, which may be permanently fixed to the X-ray suite table, or attached by wires. It is possible that wireless systems may become available in the future.</p>
<p>An <italic>immediate</italic> image is generated on a screen once the imaging sensor is exposed. There is no need for processing or waiting. The digital image can then be manipulated or post-processed using a computer.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Advantages and disadvantages of digital radiography</title>
<p>It is important to realize that digital radiography gives one almost exactly the same information as a carefully obtained and processed film&#x2013;screen radiograph. In fact, film&#x2013;screen radiographs have better spatial resolution than digital radiographs. However, there are many important advantages of a digital system and these are discussed below.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Advantages:</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A wider range of exposures can be used without resulting in a non-diagnostic film, due to the increased latitude of digital systems. This results in a reduction of repeated radiographs due to poor exposure, therefore there is:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><label>&#x2013;</label><p>Increased radiation safety</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>&#x2013;</label><p>Increased patient throughput.</p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Repeats due to poor positioning or patient movement do not go away though!</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>DR is quicker than film&#x2013;screen radiography. CR processing may actually be slower (see comments below).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Theoretical ability to use lower exposure factors than for conventional film&#x2013;screen combinations. (However, note that digital radiography is generally more forgiving to overexposed than underexposed films and therefore the tendency may be to increase exposure factors over time.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Post-processing allows the viewing of individual lung areas at high magnification; it also allows the choice of different density curves to examine relatively underexposed areas, such as the vertebral column, in the same detail as the correctly exposed areas, such as the lung.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Long-term cost reduction if a completely filmless system is attained.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No lost films, no time wasted on filing or retrieving films.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All the inherent advantages of digital images, e.g. ability to send images easily as email attachment.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Disadvantages:</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Expense, especially of the DR system. Savings with the new system will only be realized once a completely filmless state is achieved, and this requires increased initial outlay.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Technology is rapidly evolving; therefore, a system may become quickly outdated.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>Need for special veterinary software: not all human systems are immediately adaptable to veterinary patients.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The resolution depends on the quality of the monitor (2000 x 2000 pixels is the minimum). Monitors with better resolution are more expensive.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CR and DR have certain artefacts that are not seen in film&#x2013;screen radiography. This is not really a disadvantage as such: they just need to be understood and avoided.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With CR, the throughput of films may actually decrease. In most systems, only one image can be processed every 90 seconds, compared with a film&#x2013;screen processor where the process takes the same amount of time, but films can be introduced one after the other.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Quality of erasing the image in the CR system depends on the type of equipment and, if poor, has dramatic repercussions on the quality of the following exposures and therefore the life of the system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The attaching wires in DR may get damaged or in the way during exposures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It may not be possible to take horizontal beam views with the fixed in-table DR systems.</p></list-item>

<p>The oesophagus is normally not visible on survey radiographs, although it can be spontaneously outlined by an accumulation of air, fluid or solid food within its lumen.

<title>Choice of contrast medium:</title>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Barium:</title>
<p>Different types of barium can be used in the examination:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Barium sulphate suspension. Should be used for initial examination. A 60&#x0025; weight/volume suspension should be used. May not distend a dilated oesophagus or show a stricture. Does not adhere well to mucosa.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Barium sulphate pastes or creams. Formulated for extreme radiopacity and to enable good adherence to oesophageal mucosa. Useful to evaluate foreign bodies and masses, but generally of limited value in the dog and cat. Paste aspiration may lead to asphyxiation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Barium sulphate suspension plus food (&#x2018;barium burger&#x2019; usually one part barium to three parts canned food/kibble). Very useful to demonstrate even early oesophageal strictures, dilatations and regional motility disorders.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Barium contrast media are delicately equilibrated suspensions, which easily precipitate if mixed with water of less than optimal hardness. It is therefore best to use barium suspensions that are premixed in different concentrations by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>If barium is <italic>aspirated</italic> the consequences are usually limited as long as the volume is small. The aspirated barium usually coats only the trachea and is then removed by ciliary motion and coughing. Aspiration of barium into the alveoli may result in permanent visualization, but is unlikely to affect lung function. However, clinical signs seen are related to the volume and location of aspirated barium. Rare consequences include pneumonia and granulomatous reactions.</p>
<p>If an <italic>oesophageal perforation</italic> or <italic>broncho-oesophageal fistula</italic> is present or suspected then barium should not be used, as mediastinal complications such as adhesions and granuloma formation may result. In this situation <italic>non-ionic iodinated contrast media alone</italic> (no kibble/food, etc.) should be used. Ionic iodinated agents should also be avoided as aspiration of hypertonic contrast media can result in pulmonary oedema and possibly death.</p>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Iodinated contrast media:</title>
<p>Two main classes exist. Both types taste bitter and an oesophageal tube is usually required for administration. The types are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Ionic</italic> (hyperosmolar) iodinated contrast media, e.g. diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium (Gastrografin<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>). Ionic forms are cheaper than non-ionic but may induce pulmonary oedema if aspirated. They may also cause severe dehydration in an already volume-depleted animal while passing through the gastrointestinal tract due to the hypertonicity of the agent</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Non-ionic</italic> (low osmolar) iodinated contrast media, e.g. iohexol (Omnipaque<sup>&#x00AE;</sup>). These have far fewer side effects but are more expensive than ionic agents. Iso-osmolar forms are also available but are even more expensive. Non-ionic contrast media must be used in cases where a gastrointestinal perforation or broncho-oesophageal fistula is suspected.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Air or other gas:</title>
<p>This is also known as a negative contrast study or pneumo-oesophagram; it is not used routinely. It is occasionally useful, for example, to define an oesophageal mass (see Figure 9.21b, p. 209). Air embolism is a theroretically possible side effect, but is extremely unlikely.</p>
</sec5>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Technique:</title>
<p>Oesophagography is quick and easy to perform. No specific patient preparation is required, although a hungry patient may ease the job of <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>administering a contrast media/food mixture. The patient must be conscious. Sedation should be avoided as this may depress gastrointestinal motility; however, an extremely difficult patient may be given a low dose of a phenothiazine sedative.</p>
<p>Survey radiographs are a prerequisite; significant findings may be identified prior to contrast media administration (e.g. foreign body) and appropriate exposure factors can be selected.</p>
<p>The technique is as follows:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Administer approximately 10&#x2013;20 ml of contrast medium orally to induce several complete swallows.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Start with barium sulphate suspension (liquid).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obtain immediate lateral and VD (or DV) radiographs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Then offer a barium/food mixture or place it in the mouth.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Repeat radiographs.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Lateral views are the most informative. The visibility of the thoracic inlet can be improved by moving one thoracic limb cranially and the other caudally. Additional information may be gained from an oblique VD view of the thoracic oesophagus: the beam should be angled 15&#x2013;30 degrees from left ventral to right dorsal.</p>
<p>Fluoroscopy is required for the evaluation of functional disorders resulting in dysphagia (e.g. cricopharyngeal achalasia or pharyngeal incoordination). The evaluation of these disorders is beyond the scope of this manual. They should be investigated first with barium sulphate suspension followed by a mixture of barium and food/kibble. Extremely slow frame rates are required for meaningful assessment of swallowing disorders. Care should be taken when administering contrast media to animals with swallowing disorders to minimize the risk of aspiration.</p>
<p>A pneumo-oesophagram is carried out on an anaesthetized patient. The oesophagus is inflated with room air using a second endotracheal (ET) tube (with the cuff inflated).</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Prerequisites for evaluation of thoracic radiographs</title>
<p>Interpreting thoracic radiographs is not an easy task, even for an experienced radiologist. The best approach is to adopt a careful routine for viewing a series of thoracic films. The following is a suggested protocol:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Your viewing area should be quiet and dark and an appropriate bright light should be available for viewing relatively overexposed regions of the films</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do you have an adequate number of views?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the animal well positioned and are the radiographs of diagnostic quality?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What phase of respiration were the films acquired in?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the phase of respiration alter between films? (This is useful to assess hyperinflation and air trapping, upper respiratory tract obstructions, tracheal collapse, fibrotic conditions, etc.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the body condition of the animal and how does this affect your interpretation of the film?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the age of the animal and how does this affect your interpretation of the film?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the breed of the animal and how does this affect your interpretation of the film?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>After reading the films, ask yourself whether further views would assist in your diagnosis (e.g. a decubitus view, an end-expiratory view, an additional lateral view).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Systematic evaluation of the thoracic radiograph</title>
<p>There are many appropriate techniques for reading radiographs. Some people prefer to assess anatomical structures or regions in a particular order (see below). Other people prefer to assess a film from top to bottom, or from the centre out, or from left to right. The important thing is to choose a technique that suits you and that covers every structure on the film, and then stick to it each time you look at a radiograph.</p>
<p>In a clinical setting you will usually be reading the radiograph with the patient history in mind. You may find it useful to look at films without prior knowledge of the clinical history of the patient whenever this is possible (e.g. reviewing films for a colleague). This helps to prevent bias and enables you to keep an open mind as to the abnormalities that may be present. It is then advisable to review the film in the light of the clinical information and finally to look again at the regions of the film that you considered to be normal. It is also valuable to discuss radiographs with colleagues and to look at them again later. All of these techniques may assist in reducing the inevitable number of errors in thoracic radiographic interpretation.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Anatomical</title>
<p>The following is a suggested route for reading a thoracic radiograph based on the patient&#x2019;s anatomy. Each of the R&#x00F6;ntgen signs (see below) should be considered for each structure. Look at:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The surrounding soft tissues</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The cranial abdomen and diaphragm</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The neck</p></list-item>

<caption><title>The simple technique of rotating a radiograph 90 degrees to an unfamiliar position immediately enables the observer to assess the ribs and other skeletal structures more thoroughly.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
</fig>
<p>Many people find it useful to rotate the radiograph 90 degrees when assessing the ribs. By creating this unfamiliar way of looking at the radiograph the ribs appear to &#x2018;stand out&#x2019; more to the observer (Figure 1.21).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Topographical</title>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to assess thoracic radiographs by dividing up the image into different areas and assessing them step-by-step. This can be done as a cranial-to-caudal, central-to-peripheral approach or any other way ensuring that each part of the radiograph is assessed. One advantage of the topographical method is a less biased assessment because every area is evaluated out of its anatomical and physiological context. The disadvantage is the lack of this context, which makes it harder to develop a coherent description and meaningful diagnosis. Also, some important thoracic compartments are normally not visible (pleural space, mediastinum), and ensuring the absence of a structure is somewhat more awkward to encompass with a topographical search.</p>
<p>To some degree a topographical search is always part of an anatomical assessment plan (e.g. searching for nodules throughout the lungs).</p>
</sec3>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Variations in radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>Enormous variation exists in the normal radiographic appearance of the thorax, especially in the dog. It is essential to consider these variable factors every time a radiograph is assessed. Some may be removed by repeating the exposure (e.g. a second attempt at obtaining an inspiratory rather than an expiratory film) but others are an inherent feature of the patient and cannot be altered (e.g. age, breed). Ignoring these normal variations will undoubtedly lead to hazardous interpretation and to possible misdiagnosis. These variations are also described in more detail in the respective anatomical chapters of this manual.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Breed, age, sex and body condition</title>
<p>These factors have an important influence on the appearance of normal radiographic anatomy.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Breed:</title>
<p>This has little influence on the normal appearance of a feline radiograph, but considerable impact on the evaluation of canine thoracic radiographs. Three main canine body types should be recognized:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Deep, narrow-chested conformation (e.g. Afghan Hound, Irish Setter, Greyhound)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intermediate thoracic conformation (e.g. German Shepherd Dog, Boxer, Retriever, Standard Poodle)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wide, shallow conformation (e.g. Boston Terrier, Bulldog).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>These conformational variations have importance in the evaluation of structures such as the mediastinum and cardiac silhouette. This is discussed later in the individual chapter sections.</p>
<p>Additional factors to consider are breed-related spinal abnormalities (e.g. wedge or butterfly vertebrae in screw-tailed breeds such as the French Bulldog) that can lead to kyphosis, scoliosis or lordosis (Figure 1.22). Sternal abnormalities (such as pectus excavatum) will also influence the radiographic appearance of the thorax. Alterations in the spinal or sternal <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>curvature may result in the projection of normal soft tissue structures over the lung fields. Chondro&#x00AD;dystrophoid breeds (especially the Basset Hound) often have unusual costal cartilage and knobbly costo&#x00AD;chondral junctions, which may appear nodule-like and create confusing shadows over the lung fields.</p>

<title>Age:</title>
<p>Young animals have a detectable thymic shadow. This reaches a maximum size at about 4 months and then progressively involutes until it is no longer radiographically visible (usually not seen after the age of 6 months). Depending on the age of the animal, open physes may be seen in the skeleton.</p>
<p>Many old dogs (Figure 1.23) have varying degrees of spondylosis deformans, degenerative sternal changes, mineralized costochondral junctions, bronchial and tracheal rings, pulmonary osteomas and some degree of age-related fine interstitial lung patterns. Pleural thickening may also be seen in older animals.</p>

<p>Note the spondylosis deformans and degenerative changes in the sternum and fine interstitial lung pattern. These are age-related changes.</p>
</fig>
<p>Older cats may have an elongated aorta and this is often accompanied by a cranially sloping cardiac silhouette. Fragmented costal cartilages are seen as a normal variation in some older cats.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Sex:</title>
<p>Females often have prominent nipples (especially pregnant, in-season or older postparturient bitches) and these can be confused with pulmonary nodules when superimposed over the lung fields.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Body condition:</title>
<p>Obesity influences the interpretation of many thoracic structures (Figure 1.24). Large amounts of fat will alter the appearance of the cardiac silhouette (mimicking cardiomegaly), widen the cranial mediastinum, create an overall increase in the opacity of the lung fields and separate the edge of the lung from the thoracic wall (mimicking a pleural effusion). Exposures should be increased for thoracic radiography in these animals, but despite this action considerable difficulty still exists in the interpretation of films from overweight patients.</p>
<fig>
<label>1.24</label>
<caption><title>DV radiograph of the thorax of an extremely fat dog.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The large amount of pericardial fat is evident as a separate structure in this dog (between black and white arrows) but in many animals is not distinguishable and may mimic cardiomegaly. The cranial mediastinum is very wide due to the presence of fat and the lung fields are generally increased in opacity.</p>
</fig>
<p>Emaciated animals will appear to have hyperlucent lung fields and exposures will need to be reduced in these animals to create a diagnostic radiograph. Structures such as the azygous vein may also be seen in a thin animal. This is especially the case in narrow-chested breeds such as the Greyhound. Severe emaciation can also result in microcardia (a small cardiac silhouette).</p>

<title>Respiratory phase</title>
<p>It is important to recognize the differences between radiographs obtained at full inspiration and those obtained during expiration. Figure 1.25 outlines the major differences and Figure 12.9 (p. 246) illustrates these principles.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cardiac cycle</title>
<p>The influence of cardiac motion on a radiograph varies from animal to animal. Generally the edges of the cardiac silhouette should appear slightly hazy due to the presence of cardiac motion during the radiographic exposure, and a sharply marginated, enlarged cardiac silhouette should alert the clinician to the possibility of a pericardial effusion. The changes between systole and diastole are best seen in large dogs, on the DV view and with short exposure times. Near end-systole the ventricular area is small and the atria are well rounded and bulging out. At end-diastole the ventricles are larger and rounder and the atria less conspicuous. The main pulmonary artery varies a great deal during the cardiac cycle and will appear more prominent during systole.</p>

<p>There are inherent differences between left and right lateral views and between DV and VD radiographs of the thorax. It is even possible to identify which view has been obtained based on the appearance of certain anatomical structures on the film. These principles are shown in Figures 1.26, 1.27, 1.28 and 1.29. These differences are more pronounced in larger dogs than in small dogs and cats.</p>

They appear parallel to one another in the right lateral view and form a &#x2018;Y&#x2019; shape on the left lateral view. The caudal vena cava (green lines) merges with the right crus as it passes through the diaphragm. This is the more cranial crus on the right lateral view and the more caudal crus on the left lateral view (the abdominal contents push the lowermost crus forward). (c) Right lateral view.

<title>Border obliteration (silhouette) sign</title>
<p>The visibility of a radiographed object depends on the opacity difference between itself and its surroundings. If two (or more) structures of similar opacity are in direct contact with each other, they will be projected as one merged silhouette on a radiograph. The border between them will not be visible radiographically. This disappearance of individual silhouettes is called the <italic>border obliteration sign</italic> (also known as border effacement).<italic></italic> The alternative term <italic>silhouette sign</italic> is frequently used but confusing, since it does not clearly emphasize the loss of individual silhouettes.</p>
<p>Some examples of lost individual soft tissue silhouettes are:

<title>Mass and mass effect</title>
<p>In diagnostic imaging, any space-occupying lesion is regarded as a<italic> mass</italic>, regardless of its origin and nature. Since the external boundaries of the thorax are limited (as in most other regions of the body), a mass can only grow by displacing and/or compressing other organs. As a result the displaced organs will be found in a different location. Should they be compressible, they will also assume an abnormal shape. This is called a <italic>mass effect</italic>. The mass effect is an essential diagnostic tool in situations where the mass itself is not clearly visible radiographically, but its position and origin can be assumed based on the magnitude and direction of the visible deviated and/or compressed organ.</p>
<p>An example is cardiomegaly with marked pleural effusion. The cardiac silhouette is no longer radiographically evident due to the border obliteration by the pleural fluid. Its size (mass effect) displaces the trachea dorsally on the lateral thoracic radiograph. This is a sign of cardiomegaly.</p>
<p>The term <italic>mediastinal shift</italic> (also known as cardiac shift) describes the mass effect on DV/VD radiographs. The cardiac silhouette may be displaced away from the midline by a mass, or may fall away from the midline towards a collapsed lung lobe (see also Chapter 8 for further information).</p>
<p>The term <italic>extrapleural sign</italic> is also an adaptation of the mass effect where a lung margin is locally deviated from a mass arising from the chest wall (ribs, soft tissues, sternal lymph node) (see also Chapter 13).</p>

<title>General thoracic ultrasonography</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Indications</title>
<p>Non-cardiac thoracic ultrasonography is increasingly used in veterinary medicine. Despite the fact that ultrasound waves are not able to penetrate air-containing lung, there are many applications of non-cardiac thoracic ultrasonography. A complete set of thoracic radiographs should be acquired initially and these are then used to determine the area of interest to be examined ultrasonographically.</p>
<p>Indications for thoracic ultrasonography include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pleural effusion obscuring thoracic or mediastinal contents</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mediastinal widening with suspicion of a mediastinal mass</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung consolidation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Thoracic wall or pleural masses</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Suspicion of diaphragmatic hernia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Suspicion of lung lobe torsion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Diagnostic fine-needle aspiration or biopsy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Therapeutic pleural fluid removal.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Restraint and patient preparation</title>
<p>Patients are routinely prepared by clipping the hair coat, cleaning the skin with alcohol and applying coupling gel. For fine-needle aspiration and biopsy procedures, aseptic preparation of the skin is required.</p>
<p>Most patients can be examined awake with minimal restraint, in lateral or dorsal recumbency. Dyspnoeic patients should be examined in the position they feel most comfortable with, in sternal recumbency or standing. In the absence of, or with minimal pleural effusion, scanning from the <italic>dependent</italic> side may be essential to identify heart, mediastinum or pulmonary masses or consolidations. General anaesthesia is required if biopsy specimens are taken of any thoracic structures in order to control respiratory movement. For fine-needle aspiration, sedation can be sufficient.</p>
<p>Coagulation profiles should also be obtained prior to ultrasound-guided biopsy procedures. These are generally not required for fine-needle aspiration techniques unless there is a clinical suspicion that a patient has a coagulopathy.</p>
<p>In most cases it is sufficient to clip the ventral half of the thorax along the sternum. The dorsal lung field is usually still aerated and causes too many artefacts to allow ultrasonographic evaluation. In selective cases with dorsal lung or chest wall masses, the dorsal chest wall is also clipped, based on radiographic location of the lesion.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Technique</title>
<p>A non-cardiac thoracic ultrasound examination is usually targeted to an area of interest identified on survey radiographs. Depending on the location of the suspected lesion (mediastinum, thoracic wall, pulmonary parenchyma) different windows have to be used. These may be intercostal, parasternal, subcostal, transhepatic or via the thoracic inlet. Specific suggestions are provided below.</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Examination method</title>
<p>Using each intercostal space as a scan window, the thorax is examined in a dorsal and transverse plane, following the intercostal spaces as far dorsally as the aerated lungs allow. Both sides are routinely examined. The structures described below are identified.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Body wall, pleural and lung surface:</title>
<p>Normal ribs are seen as round (in short axis) or linear (in long axis) structures with a distal acoustic shadowing (Figure 2.1). The surface of the ribs is smooth and hyperechoic, any interruption of the cortex is a sign of either rib fracture or lysis. The layers of the body wall result in a striated appearance of the tissue with medium echogenicity. The body wall is best examined using a linear transducer (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).</p>
<p>The pleural surface is seen as a bright hyperechoic line covering the lungs. The two layers are not seen separately in a small animal; only the visceral pleural surface of the lung is visible as a bright, smooth, continuous hyperechoic line (see Figure 2.2). It is very important to observe the movement of the pleural surface: normal pleura glides smoothly against the chest wall with respiration.</p>
<fig>

<caption><title>Dorsal image of the thorax of a normal adult Border Collie, using an 8 MHz microcurved transducer.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The chest wall with subcutaneous fat and intercostal musculature is mainly hypoechoic with linear striations. The ribs (*) are seen in cross section and create a strong distal acoustic shadow. The lung surface presents as a bright hyperechoic line.</p>
</fig>
<fig>
<label>2.2</label>
<caption><title>Transverse image of the dorsal eighth intercostal space of a normal adult Border Collie, using a 12 MHz linear transducer.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>Compared with Figure 2.1, the layers of the body wall (thin arrow) in the near field are shown with better resolution due to the high frequency and linear nature of the transducer. The lung surface is visible as a bright, continuous line (arrowheads). Distal to the lung surface, the attenuation of the sound waves results in shadowing with multiple horizontal echogenic lines, caused by reverberation artefacts.</p>
</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>On the lung surface almost all ultrasound waves are reflected by the soft tissue&#x2013;gas interface, resulting in distal acoustic shadowing. The shadowing is inhomogenous (&#x2018;dirty&#x2019;) due to multiple reverberation artefacts, seen as very echogenic linear echoes deep and parallel to the lung surface (see Figure 2.2). Reverberation artefacts are created by strong reflection of the ultrasound beam off the aerated lung tissue. Interruption of the normal &#x2018;dirty&#x2019; shadowing and the presence of a column of densely spaced, small linear artefacts (comet tail artefacts) (Figure 2.3) are a result of focal non-aerated lung tissue or incidental peripheral mineralizations (benign pulmonary osteomas). Larger consolidations or nodules present as hypoechoic areas, interrupting the normal hyperechoic lung surface (Figure 2.4). Observation of the respiratory movement and appearance of gas within a lesion allows differentiation between pulmonary and extrapulmonary origin of the lesion.</p>

<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Mediastinum:</title>
<p>Three different parts of the mediastinum are identified ultrasonographically: the cranial, middle (cardiac) and caudal mediastinum. The examination is limited to the ventral aspects as the dorsal mediastinum is usually surrounded by aerated lung.</p>
<p>The caudal mediastinum is very thin, accommodating the caudal vena cava, oesophagus and accessory lung lobe. These structures are best seen close to the diaphragm using a subcostal approach with the liver as the acoustic window. The most dorsal part of the caudal mediastinum containing the aorta and azygos vein is usually not accessible ultrasonographically. Using the heart or the cranioventral part <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>of the liver as an acoustic window, a portion of the caudoventral mediastinum can be seen in most animals (Figure 2.5). It contains variable amounts of fat. If pleural effusion is present, the caudoventral mediastinum can be seen as a thin undulating hyperechoic structure (Figure 2.6).</p>
<fig>
<label>2.5</label>
<caption><title>Parasternal sagittal view of the caudoventral thorax in an adult crossbreed dog, the transducer is placed just lateral to the last sternebra.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>Between the heart (a) and the liver (b), outlined by a curvilinear hyperechoic line representing the diaphragm&#x2013;lung interface, a small triangular area of fat can be seen in the caudal mediastinum (c).</p>

<p>The heart (a) and a partially collapsed ventral tip of the right caudal lung lobe (b) are seen on the left. The caudal mediastinum is visible as an irregular, thin, hyperechoic structure (arrowed).</p>
</fig>
<p>The cranial mediastinum can be examined through the thoracic inlet or using a parasternal intercostal window. The trachea and external jugular veins can be observed through the thoracic inlet. The trachea is easy to identify based on the structure of the cartilage rings, which give the trachea a rippled surface, and the air column within the trachea, which produces reverberation artefacts. The jugular veins are easily compressed and are bilateral tubular, anechoic structures close to the skin surface (Figure 2.7).</p>
<fig>
<label>2.7</label>
<caption><title>Sagittal oblique view with the curvilinear probe slightly to the right side in the thoracic inlet.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The jugular vein (a) can be seen entering the thorax and the tip of the right cranial lung lobe (b) is visible (easier to identify when respiratory movement can be observed).</p>
</fig>
<p>If an intercostal approach is chosen, it is important to pull the thoracic limb as far cranially as possible to access the cranial intercostal spaces. The transducer is placed just dorsal to the sternum and cranial to the heart.</p>
<p>In the presence of pleural effusion, the ventral portion of the cranial mediastinum is a thin stripe of echogenic tissue, depending on the amount of mediastinal fat, and can be examined quite easily for presence of lymphadenopathy or other masses (Figure 2.8). The cranial vena cava, if visible, is a good landmark to identify the surrounding mediastinum (Figure 2.9) and should be examined for evidence of thrombosis in animals with pleural effusion.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The whole width of the cranial thorax can be examined: thoracic wall (a), pleural space with anechoic effusion (b), collapsed lung lobe (c), cranial mediastinum (d), which is very thin without evidence of lymphadenopathy or other masses, and the heart (e).</p>

<label>2.9</label>
<caption><title>Dorsal image of the cranial thorax of a 12-year-old neutered male crossbreed dog with pleural effusion.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The cranial vena cava (a) and surrounding mediastinum with some fat are seen between the fluid-filled left and right pleural spaces (b).</p>
</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>Normal sternal or mediastinal lymph nodes are not differentiated from the surrounding mediastinal fat. Mediastinal fat is fairly uniform and can be recognized by its coarse structure, poor margination and poor transmission of the ultrasound beam (Figure 2.10). Especially in brachycephalic breeds and obese animals, a large amount of fat can be observed in the mediastinum and should not be confused with a mediastinal mass. Most mediastinal masses or abnormal lymph nodes are hypoechoic or sometimes heterogenic, well defined and rounded (Figure 2.11).</p>
<p>In young animals, thymic tissue is present cranial to the heart, best seen from the left side. It has a granular, homogenous texture and contains a large amount of blood vessels.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diaphragm:</title>
<p>The normal diaphragm is normally not seen as a separate structure; the highly reflective hyperechoic lung interface blends in with the diaphragm. The diaphragm is only seen in its full thickness in cases of pleural and peritoneal effusion. A normal diaphragm has a smooth, curvilinear, continuous surface (Figure 2.12). Examination of the diaphragm is best performed with a subcostal approach, placing the transducer just behind the ribcage and examining the diaphragm in sagittal, dorsal and transverse planes. In the presence of pleural effusion, the cranial surface of the diaphragm can also be evaluated using an intercostal window. Care should be taken not to confuse consolidated lung tissue or pericardial fat with herniated abdominal organs; an ultrasound examination of the cranial abdominal organs usually helps to determine the origin of abnormal intrathoracic tissue.</p>

<title>Fine-needle aspiration</title>
<p>Twenty-two gauge needles of various lengths are usually used for diagnostic pleural fluid aspiration. In very cellular (seen as very echogenic) effusions larger gauge needles are sometimes necessary. Sedation is not usually required for this procedure. Appropriate collection devices (for cytology, culture, etc.) should be available.</p>

<p>The curvilinear probe is placed directly caudal to the xiphoid and angled cranially. The diaphragm&#x2013;lung interface is seen as a continuous, bright, curvilinear structure covering the surface of the liver (arrowed).</p>
</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>Therapeutic pleural fluid aspiration is performed under ultrasound guidance if the effusion is loculated and exact needle placement is the only method to drain the thorax adequately. A 16&#x2013;22 gauge needle, depending on the size of the patient and the cellularity of the fluid, is connected to an extension set with a three-way stopcock. A large fluid pocket cranial or caudal to the heart is identified, and the position of the needle is constantly observed during the procedure to avoid laceration of lung tissue or obstruction of the needle by fibrin strands.</p>
<p>Fine-needle aspiration of mediastinal and thoracic wall masses, using a 22 gauge needle, is performed if an acoustic window for safe approach to the lesion can be found. Care should be taken to avoid large mediastinal vessels: colour Doppler ultrasonography can be used to identify a safe window.</p>
<p>Fine-needle aspiration of lung masses can only be performed if the lesion is superficial and not covered by more than 1&#x2013;2 cm of aerated lung tissue. It is essential in these cases to localize the mass on survey radiographs before starting the procedure. A thin layer of air-filled lung tissue can be reduced by keeping the animal in lateral recumbency with the affected side down for 5&#x2013;10 minutes. Atelectasis of the lung tissue is usually sufficient to visualize and sample the lesion either from the dependent or the non-dependent side, as the lung stays atelectatic for a few minutes.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Biopsy</title>
<p>Biopsies of mass lesions are always performed under general anaesthesia. It is important to control respiratory motion during the biopsy procedure whether the origin of the lesion is mediastinal or pulmonary or in the thoracic wall. A coagulation profile should be checked prior to the procedure. Fourteen to eighteen gauge automated or semiautomatic biopsy devices are most commonly used. The skin is aseptically prepared and a small incision is made with a scalpel blade. The depth of the lesion has to be measured and the length of the biopsy throw adjusted. Colour Doppler ultrasonography is useful to make sure no large vessels are in the biopsy path.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Complications</title>
<p><italic>Pneumothorax</italic> can occur, more commonly after biopsy, but also after fine-needle aspiration of pulmonary lesions. It can be recognized immediately after or during the procedure if the lesion suddenly disappears and a broad hyperechoic layer appears directly underneath the chest wall with distal reverberation artefacts. This is similar to the appearance of a normal lung surface, but it <italic>does</italic> <italic>not move</italic> with respiration. The extent of the pneumothorax and lung collapse is best assessed radiographically. Even though pneumothorax is a rare complication, equipment to perform a therapeutic thoracocentesis should always be available during aspiration or biopsy techniques.</p>
<p><italic>Haemorrhage</italic> is a very uncommon complication of thoracic interventional procedures and is usually minimal and self-limiting. Intervention is only required occasionally.</p>

<title>Echocardiography</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Indications</title>
<p>Echocardiography (cardiac ultrasonography) has revolutionized the non-invasive assessment of cardiac disease. The ability of ultrasonography to discriminate between soft tissue (myocardium) and fluid (the blood pool) permits easy assessment of:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The structure, size and relative proportions of the specific heart chambers and walls</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Heart valves</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Great vessels</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cardiac performance (particularly systolic function)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The presence of a pericardial effusion.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>It should be appreciated that echocardiography is <italic>complementary</italic> to thoracic radiography. Both techniques are essential in the investigation of a cardiac patient, particularly in conditions associated with left-sided volume overload, as radiographs demonstrate the haemodynamic significance of this on the pulmonary vasculature and lung field.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Quantitative echocardiography allows standard assessment of chamber size or wall measurements, which can be compared with reference values for the species, breed or size of animal, where these data are available. Measurements can be carried out on both two-dimensional (2D) and M-mode images.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Doppler echocardiography demonstrates the direction, velocity and character of flow within the heart and great vessels. It is indicated for the identification of the cause of a heart murmur detected clinically, and for assessing its clinical significance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A complete systematic 2D, M-mode and Doppler echocardiographic examination will enable a diagnosis to be made and assessment of the severity of most acquired or congenital heart diseases in animals, without resorting to invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterization and angiography.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Restraint and patient preparation</title>
<p>Animals with life-threatening pulmonary oedema or arrhythmias should always be stabilized prior to an echocardiographic examination. Dyspnoeic cats should never be restrained in lateral recumbency. Treatment and stabilization over 24&#x2013;48 hours may be required before a definitive diagnosis of cardiac disease can be made, once the patient is breathing normally. As ultrasonography is exquisitely sensitive at detecting fluid, rapid thoracic imaging of a dyspnoeic animal (in sternal recumbency) identifies whether a pleural effusion is responsible, which can then be drained.</p>
<p>The fur is clipped over the left and right thorax, over the area of the palpable cardiac impulse. If the subcostal view is to be utilized, a small square caudal to the xiphisternum should also be clipped. For more rapid acoustic contact, the clipped area can be soaked in surgical spirit before applying ultrasound coupling gel.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>Animals are gently restrained in lateral recumbency (right then left). Cats, especially, should not feel over-restrained (they may need more than one handler restraining them). The lower fore- and hindlimbs should be held by the handler(s) to prevent the patient rising from the table, thus allowing the operator to keep equipment and transducers safe from damage. The animal should be comfortable, on bedding material, so they may actually fall asleep in quiet, calm conditions.</p>
<p>Chemical restraint is not normally required. As sedative drugs may influence heart rate, contractility, wall thickness and flow velocities, they are best avoided. However, it is appreciated that they may be indicated in uncooperative or very stressed patients. Similar drugs and dose rates in cardiac patients are used as for radiographic positioning:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Suggested sedation for dogs with heart disease: intramuscular injection of acetylpromazine (0.02&#x2013;0.03 mg/kg) with butorphanol (0.1&#x2013;0.2 mg/kg) in same syringe</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Suggested sedation for cats with heart disease. Initially calm cat: intramuscular injection of acetylpromazine (0.05 mg/kg) with butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg) in same syringe. If the cat is extremely uncooperative, then an intramuscular injection of midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) and ketamine (5 mg/kg) in same syringe can be given. (Ketamine will increase heart rate, making assessment of diastolic function difficult.)</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Electrocardiographic electrodes need to be applied. As a complete study takes a minimum of 30 minutes, it is preferable to use adhesive electrodes (on the main pads of the feet) rather than crocodile clips on the skin. Normally, a lead II is obtained to optimize complex size and recognition, with electrodes on the right forelimb and the left hindlimb, with the earth lead positioned wherever else is convenient (e.g. right hindlimb).</p>
<p>The right-sided views are used for 2D and M-mode images and measurements. Image quality is good as the heart is perpendicular to the ultrasound beam. For the right-handed operator, the animal remains in this position for the subcostal view.</p>
<p>The animal is turned over, still with sternum towards the operator, for the left-sided views. These give a &#x2018;vertical&#x2019; heart, so image quality is less good, as structures other than the heart base are parallel to the ultrasound beam. However, alignment with intracardiac flow is optimized, facilitating Doppler studies. Access over several rib spaces (third to sixth) is required for all standard left-sided views; the animal may need to be repositioned during the course of the study, to permit access for all views.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Technique</title>
<p>The conventional standard display of images is that right-sided and basilar structures are displayed to the right of the screen (with a single exception: the left apical four-chamber view, which is displayed like a dorsoventral (DV) radiograph, with left to the right side of the screen). To achieve this, with the operator&#x2019;s thumb on the transducer thumb-mark near the animal&#x2019;s sternum, the left&#x2013;right image reverse facility of the ultrasound machine may be required.</p>
<p>2D (also known as B-mode) images represent a &#x2018;slice&#x2019; through a complex, three-dimensional (3D) structure. Cardiac anatomy must be thoroughly appreciated to acquire and interpret these views; a model of the heart adjacent to the ultrasound machine can facilitate this. Most of the anatomy is appreciated from these 2D views. The standard 2D views are also essential:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To position the M-mode cursor for M-mode studies</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For colour flow interrogation of the heart valves, septa and great vessels</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To position the spectral Doppler cursor (for pulsed wave (PW) or continuous wave (CW) Doppler) to record blood flow direction, velocity and character.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In general, the right parasternal (RPS) views are used to assess the anatomy and for M-mode studies. The left apical and left parasternal (LPS) views are used for Doppler studies. 2D images are described as being long-axis or short-axis, depending on whether the ventricular axis or aorta is being displayed in longitudinal or cross-sectional planes, respectively.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Equipment</title>
<p>A sector transducer (either mechanical or phased array) is required to image the heart through windows between the lung lobes and the rib spaces. A linear transducer or a curvilinear transducer with a large footprint is not appropriate, as it would not permit acquisition of images acquired by rotation or angulation.</p>
<p>A range of transducers, offering various frequencies, is normally required to scan veterinary patients:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Cats and very small dogs require a 7.5 MHz transducer</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Medium-sized dogs require a 5.0 MHz transducer</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Giant breeds of dogs require a 2.5 MHz transducer</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The highest frequency transducer offering appropriate penetration should be selected, to optimize image resolution</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For Doppler studies, a lower frequency transducer may be required than that for optimal imaging; transducers may need to be changed during the course of the study.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>A purpose-designed echo table should be used, with a hole or a wedge over which the animal lies in lateral recumbency. Images are acquired through the dependent chest wall. The hypostatic effects on the dependent lung minimize air interference on the cardiac images.</p>
<p>Cardiac software is required on the ultrasound machine. A simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) should be recorded with the images. Accurate measurement depends on defining phases of diastole or systole. Generally, end-diastolic measurements are taken at the start of the QRS complex. End-systolic measurements are taken at the end of the T wave (or at the smallest left ventricle (LV) cavity).</p>

<p>Acquisition of the standard RPS views is described and illustrated in Figure 2.13; the subcostal view is also shown. The corresponding observations, measurements and calculations are also indicated in Figure 2.13. Acquisition of the standard left apical and LPS views is described and illustrated in Figure 2.14.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>M-mode echocardiography</title>
<p>M-mode measurements are just one-dimensional (1D). The images are motion&#x2013;time graphs. Temporal resolution is very high (in contrast to 2D and spectral Doppler images). The M-mode cursor can be accurately positioned on the 2D image.</p>
<p>M-mode measurements need to be carefully and consistently acquired for them to be useful in patient follow-up or in comparison with reference values for the species, breed and weight, where these data are available. Acquisition of M-mode images and methods of measurement are detailed in Figure 2.15.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Doppler echocardiography</title>
<p>J. Christian D&#x00F6;ppler originally defined the Doppler principle. This states that there is an apparent change in transmitted frequency, reflected back to the source off a target, which occurs as a result of the movement of the source or the target. This phenomenon is readily appreciated as a police car with siren noise approaches, then passes the observer; the sound is of higher frequency as it approaches, and lower frequency as it moves away from the observer. There are several practical applications, not least important of which is Doppler echocardiography.</p>
<p>In Doppler echocardiography, a pulse of sound is emitted from the transducer. This is reflected off moving targets within the heart, the red blood cells (RBCs). The apparent shift in frequency of the sound reflected back to the transducer is proportional to the velocity of the RBCs and their direction of movement. The software of a Doppler echocardiography machine converts this Doppler into an audible signal and a visual display, and velocity of the RBCs is calculated. The flow through each valve varies during the cardiac cycle; these events can be plotted against time (with the simultaneously recorded ECG). This gives the spectral Doppler trace, a velocity&#x2013;time graph.</p>
<p>In PW Doppler, a sample volume may be positioned within the area of interest. A pulse of ultrasound waves is emitted by the crystal in the transducer. Only the RBCs in the area of interest are assessed; ultrasound waves are reflected back to the transducer before another pulse is transmitted. Because of the time required for sampling in this way, only low velocities can be measured. If blood is moving at a velocity exceeding the <italic>Nyquist limit</italic> of the machine settings, it is shown &#x2018;wrapped around&#x2019; in the opposite direction; this is called <italic>aliasing</italic>. Aliasing, thus, results in directional ambiguity.</p>
<p>PW Doppler gives information about flow velocity and direction of flow (towards the observer is displayed above the baseline, away is displayed below the baseline of the spectral trace). Character of flow is also illustrated with PW Doppler. Laminar flow, due to RBCs moving in &#x2018;sheets&#x2019;, uniformly accelerating and decelerating, is indicated by a clean &#x2018;envelope&#x2019; (see Figure 2.16). Turbulent flow tends to occur at higher velocities, and whorls and eddies of flow, giving a filled in, less tidy signal on pulsed-wave spectra. PW Doppler may be limited at the depth of image being interrogated.</p>
<p>High pulse repetition frequency (HPRF) spectral Doppler describes additional sample volumes along the cursor line, as well as the region of interest at a particular valve. The transducer does not wait for a pulse of ultrasound waves to be reflected back prior to transmitting another pulse; this allows much higher velocities to be assessed and displayed in a spectrum by the machine without aliasing.</p>
<p>CW Doppler echocardiography also produces a spectral display. Ultrasound waves are continuously emitted from, and received back by, the transducer; the frequency shift is converted by the machine into a spectral signal that is not limited by aliasing, so very high velocities can be measured. Sampling is not specific to one region of interest; it is all along the cursor line. Most modern machines allow positioning of the CW cursor on a 2D image to ensure correct alignment with flow (steerable CW). Other CW transducers are stand-alone or ped-off probes &#x2013; these are dependent on the operator directing it until the spectrum is optimized. CW Doppler is required for recording velocity of mitral regurgitant jets or very high velocities in aortic or pulmonic stenosis.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Colour flow:</title>
<p>This is a specialized form of PW Doppler echocardiography. Within a sector, which can be directed over the area of interest within a 2D image, there is a large number of &#x2018;sample volumes&#x2019; or pixels, which are individually colour-coded according to direction and character of flow.</p>
<p>On most ultrasound machines blood moving towards the transducer is colour-coded red. Blood moving away from the transducer is colour-coded blue (see Figure 2.16). Different colour shades may be present in some software packages to give an impression of flow velocity (the higher the velocity the brighter the hue). Again, the Nyquist limit can be exceeded and fast blood moving away from the transducer may have a normal blue outline, but an aliased core (of red) can be seen.</p>
<p>Most colour flow Doppler echocardiography machines have maps to indicate colour variance or turbulent flow; these are usually colour-coded green/yellow and have a &#x2018;speckled&#x2019; or &#x2018;mosaic&#x2019; appearance, e.g. such as may be seen in a mitral regurgitant jet.</p>
<p>Colour flow Doppler can rapidly screen for abnormal flow, such as a ventricular septal defect (VSD); the left-to-right shunting causes a turbulent jet to cross into the right ventricle (RV), usually just below the tricuspid valve. Imaging of this jet allows placement of a PW or steerable CW cursor over it to obtain a spectral signal, so that velocity may be accurately measured. Colour flow Doppler echocardiography may therefore be considered as a form of non-invasive angiography.</p>

<p>It is very important to attempt to obtain maximal velocities, as these will represent best parallel alignment with flow. This may involve interrogating a valve from several different positions, e.g. aortic velocity in aortic stenosis from LPS and RPS views, and from subcostal views. The use of any angle correction facility on the machine is considered bad practice in cardiology. Despite apparent alignment in 2D, it may not be correct in 3D. Much of the learning curve in Doppler echocardiography is spent perfecting alignment with intracardiac flows.</p>

<title>Modified Bernoulli equation &#x2013; non-invasive Doppler-derived pressure gradients:</title>
<p>An estimate of pressure gradient (PG) across a valve, from the peak velocity of flow through that valve, can be determined using the modified Bernoulli equation.

<p>Where the pressure of one chamber is known or assumed, the modified Bernoulli equation can be used to estimate pressure of the other side of a valve.

<p>In the absence of pulmonic stenosis, and the presence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonic insufficiency jets, both systolic and diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure can be determined using the modified Bernoulli equation.</p>

<p>Figure 2.17 details the M-mode, 2D and Doppler methods of assessing systolic function, with advantages and limitations of each technique. To make an overall assessment of systolic function, an integrated approach is required, rather than relying on one single method.</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Assessment of left ventricular diastolic function</title>

<title>Pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging (pw-TDI)</title>
<p>Tissue Doppler echocardiography utilizes ultrasound machine settings which ignore the high-velocity, low-amplitude signals of the blood pool and record the high-amplitude, low-velocity signals of myocardial motion. The basic limitations of Doppler apply; only motion of fibres parallel with the ultrasound beam will have myocardial velocities recorded. Furthermore, velocities may be influenced by translational movement of the heart within the thorax. There are various applications of tissue Doppler, which are at the early investigational stage in veterinary echocardiography. However, pulsed wave tissue Doppler signals of the longitudinal fibres of the LV myocardium are relatively easy to acquire and interpret (Figure 2.19).</p>

<title>Summary of overall approach</title>
<p>A systematic and logical approach to obtaining standard echocardiographic images and measurements is essential in the evaluation of a cardiac patient. Following a systematic approach is more valuable than randomly surfing. Comparison with reference ranges is essential, although breed-specific reference ranges are currently sparse in the literature. Some canine breed-specific references are available for breeds susceptible to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Assessment of overall left ventricular systolic performance requires integration of 2D, M-mode and Doppler methods. Assessment of diastolic function is still in its infancy in veterinary patients, although some reference data are available for cats. An integrated approach and comprehension of the influence of heart rate and loading condition are essential.</p>

<p>Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a new modality in veterinary medicine with many potential indications and the ability to overcome some of the limitations of standard transthoracic ultrasonography. EUS is a versatile procedure that has evolved in human medicine from a purely diagnostic tool to an interventional and even therapeutic one.</p>
<p>Although standard transthoracic ultrasonography has become a valuable diagnostic procedure for the assessment of thoracic disease in small animals (see above), it is unrewarding for examining some intrathoracic anatomy. This includes the tracheobronchial lymph nodes, the oesophagus and lesions in the caudal mediastinum. Furthermore, lesions not in contact with the thoracic wall are also difficult to visualize as they are hidden from view by the aerated lungs or bony thorax. Obesity poses an additional barrier. These obstacles to visualizing intrathoracic structures can be overcome by the use of EUS.</p>
<p>EUS is a form of endoluminal scanning which allows high-frequency ultrasound transducers to be brought directly to the region of interest via conventional endoscopes placed in the oesophagus. This imaging modality provides detailed images of pathological processes both within and outside of the oesophageal wall. It has found most success in humans for staging of lung, gastric and oesophageal cancer. Although originally designed to improve diagnostics in clinical human gastroenterology, applications for endoscopic ultrasound technology have evolved to become multifaceted and include thoracic imaging.</p>
<p>Potential veterinary indications for EUS of the thorax include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Dysphagia of unknown origin</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tumour staging</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Evaluation of tracheobronchial lymph nodes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Investigation and localization of radiographic soft tissue opacities that do not have contact with the thoracic wall</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Evaluation of intrathoracic paravertebral masses</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cardiac imaging</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Assessment of infiltration of the oesophageal wall</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Differentiation of mediastinal <italic>versus</italic> pulmonary masses</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Detection of small amounts of pleural fluid</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration of intrathoracic and oesophageal lesions.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>EUS examination of the thorax is advantageous for determining the origin of intrathoracic soft tissue lesions and masses. Soft tissue opacities in the caudal thorax may be of pulmonary, mediastinal, oesophageal or (para)vertebral origin. Observation of the movement of solid lesions during respiration under anaesthesia often provides a clue as to their origin. Pulmonary lesions move with the lung&#x2019;s direction during inspiration and expiration, whereas mediastinal lesions and vertebral lesions do not. It can also be determined whether solid lesions in the region of the caudal lung lobes have attachments to the lungs or the diaphragm by observing their excursions during respiration. In addition, radiographic lesions of soft tissue opacity can be differentiated as being solid or fluid-filled using EUS.</p>
<p>Pyrexia of unknown origin may be a potential indication for EUS of the thorax (Figure 2.20). Oesophageal and perioesophageal lesions can also be further examined with EUS (Figure 2.21). Determination of oesophageal wall involvement in solid and cavitary masses is very helpful for presurgical planning and prognosis. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided transoesophageal tissue sampling of pulmonary, perioesophageal, mediastinal and oesophageal wall lesions in both cats and dogs can also be performed.</p>

<p>A fairly well circumscribed soft tissue opaque lesion in the caudal thorax is shown with air-filled dilation of the oesophagus cranial to it.

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>In human medicine, transoesophageal EUS is considered to be superior to computed tomography (CT) in the detection of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Malignant lymph nodes as small as 3 mm, which were not detected with CT, have been detected using EUS. The implementation of EUS and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration have allowed a less invasive and more cost-effective means of diagnosing metastasis in mediastinal disease compared with CT. The author [LG] has had similar experiences in dogs detecting tracheobronchial lymph nodes less than 1 cm; even those of considerable size (i.e. 6 cm) that were not visible radiographically were easily visualized with EUS. EUS may have potential in veterinary oncology for accurate staging of thoracic metastases.</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Restraint and patient preparation</title>
<p>EUS, like conventional endoscopy or CT, requires general anaesthesia. Patients should be prepared as for any routine endoscopic procedure. Positioning <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>in left lateral recumbency is generally acceptable and once a position is adopted, it should be used repeatedly. This aids the beginning endosonographer in developing their endoscopic examination technique and recognition of important landmarks. Positioning in right lateral or sternal recumbency may be required, however, depending on location of the lesion.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Technique</title>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Equipment</title>
<p>Ultrasound endoscopes are similar to conventional endoscopes but with an ultrasound transducer attached at the tip (Figure 2.22). They also include the standard endoscopic features: optic, light source, working channel and video capabilities.</p>
<fig>
<label>2.22</label>
<caption><title>Olympus video endoscope. The scope is 1.25 m long with a multifrequency (5&#x2013;10 MHz) linear transducer, 11.8 mm outer scope diameter at the insertional end and a 2.8 mm biopsy channel.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>Note that the endoscope is side-viewing (optics mounted at the side rather than the tip).</p>
</fig>
<p>Ultrasound endoscopes can either be purchased for attachment to a compatible ultrasound machine or as all-in-one dedicated units. Two types of multifrequency transducers are available, radial and linear. High-quality colour and power Doppler ultrasonography is available on most scopes. Both large- and small-breed dogs, as well as cats, can be examined with the endoscope (see Figure 2.22).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Examination method</title>
<p>In the EUS examination, intrathoracic structures are examined transoesophageally. Important landmarks include the thoracic inlet, cranial mediastinum and its great vessels, the base of the heart, bifurcation of the trachea, caudal vena cava, the thoracic vertebrae and intrathoracic aorta. Direct contact between the transducer and the oesophageal mucosa allows sufficient acoustic coupling in most cases. A condom-like stand-off balloon covering the transducer can be filled with water using the conventional buttons for suctioning and filling located on the scope handle.</p>
<p>Unlike conventional endoscopes, the echoendoscope has a much larger range of movement. The tip may be turned up to 90 degrees perpendicular to the long axis and in a 360 degree circle around it. This allows scanning in a large number of different planes.</p>
<p>Interpretation of the ultrasound views and anatomy is not as intuitive as in conventional transthoracic or transabdominal ultrasonography and a certain learning curve is required even for experienced ultrasonographers.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Fine-needle aspiration</title>
<p>Several aspiration needles of 22 gauge for solid organ sampling are available with a working handle. EUS can be used for fine-needle aspiration of various structures, including mediastinal and peri-oesophageal lymph nodes, aspiration of pleural fluid and pulmonary lesions. The aspiration technique is performed by endoscopic ultrasound-guided transoesophageal puncture and is generally performed with linear scanners. With radial scanners it is more difficult to visualize the tip of the needle because it appears only as a single point in the 360 degree image.</p>
<p>Many studies have been performed in humans and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration has been proven as feasible and safe. Bleeding, when it does occur, is usually self-limiting and appears as an echo-poor area adjacent to the sampled region. When this is detected, patients are typically treated with antibiotics and observed. Complications related to bacteraemia or infections have not been reported following transluminal fine-needle aspiration.</p>

<title>Indications</title>
<p>Computed tomography (CT) should be used in dogs and cats with suspected thoracic disease where other diagnostic imaging modalities, such as radiography and ultrasonography, fail to identify the cause and extent of the disease. CT is also indicated if the abnormalities cannot be clearly attributed to specific thoracic organs.</p>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Thoracic wall</title>
<p>Determination of the extent of palpable thoracic wall masses is essential for surgical planning. This often cannot be determined accurately radiographically. Examples include vaccine-related feline fibrosarcomas or rib tumours with unknown expansion into the thoracic cavity (Figure 3.1).</p>

<p>This image is set with a narrow window (level 65 HU, width 187 HU) to emphasize the peripheral contrast enhancement of the mass at the expense of increased visibility of image noise and streak artefacts. The lungs cannot be appropriately assessed with this window.</p>

<p>CT can be useful to investigate further the following pleural abnormalities:

<p>CT is an excellent imaging modality for many mediastinal disorders, particularly if suspected lesions cannot be clearly differentiated radiographically or ultrasonographically. Cardiovascular CT is still in its infancy in veterinary medicine and only a few clinical applications have been developed so far. CT has been shown to be particularly useful to demonstrate:
<list list-type="bullet">

<p>The image is set with a centre in the negative HU range and a wide window (level &#x2013;744 HU, width 2456 HU).

<title>Restraint and patient preparation</title>
<p>General anaesthesia is required for most thoracic CT examinations unless multislice CT scanners are available. Multislice scanners are capable of covering an entire thorax in a single breath-hold in humans and basically acquire multiple &#x2018;slices&#x2019; for each gantry rotation. Inhalation anaesthesia is mandatory for most thoracic studies with the exception of tracheal CT where intubation could prohibit the diagnostic purpose of the scan. Depending on the site of the lesion, however, advancement of the endotracheal (ET) tube only to the cervical trachea may be sufficient.</p>
<p>Anaesthetic and monitoring equipment should preferentially be placed in a way that the tubes and lines connecting it to the patient do not cross the gantry of the CT scanner, since they do create major artefacts (Figure 3.4). In a &#x2018;head first&#x2019; set-up this would mean placing the equipment behind the CT scanner, and in a &#x2018;tail first&#x2019; set-up placing it in front of the scanning unit. Regardless of patient position, there should always be sufficient length of the connections to allow adequate bed movement during the scan.</p>
<fig>

Note the anaesthetic tubing and pulse oximetry cable crossing the gantry, which can create significant artefacts. (b) The dog now in a &#x2018;tail first&#x2019; position. When the thorax is scanned, the anaesthetic equipment will not cross the gantry and artefacts are avoided.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>Note the extended forelegs to move them out the scanning area. ECG clips (not seen here) should be placed well cranial or caudal to the scanning area.</p>
</fig>
<p>CT is a modified X-ray technique that emits relatively high levels of ionizing radiation. Therefore, the patient restraint must be sufficient for all personnel to be able to leave the CT room for the duration of the scan (several minutes). It is imperative to anchor the patient securely to the CT table with large Velcro straps or other positioning devices designed for CT. Sandbags and other radiopaque positioning devices used in conventional radiography are usually not suitable for CT since they create major artefacts if located in the scan field, and have a tendency to fall off the CT table, which is much narrower than a conventional X ray table.</p>
<p>Care must be taken to avoid overt restriction of thoracic expansion, particularly in patients that are already compromised in respiration. The use of a radiographic trough can be very helpful in this respect if the appropriate size is used (Figure 3.5). Self-adhesive tape is commonly used in CT to aid positioning of an animal under general anaesthesia. However, the tape can only be fixed to the moving bed which somewhat restricts its use for thoracic CT.</p>
<fig>

<caption><title>The canine muffin sign. Occasionally CT offers completely unexpected new vistas.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>This 4-year-old St Bernard dog was positioned for a thoracic CT scan in the largest trough available. The CT image of the caudal thorax reveals a muffin-shaped cross-sectional anatomy of the dog, indicating that the trough was not big enough and was potentially restricting respiration.</p>
</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>The patient should be positioned according to the nature of the study:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In general, ventral recumbency works best for thoracic wall, pleural, mediastinal, cardiovascular and airway studies</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For lesions close to the thoracic spine, dorsal recumbency is preferred because the recumbent spine is not affected by respiratory movement</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For studies focusing on lung parenchyma, physiological hypostatic lung collapse during anaesthesia should be taken into account. For example, if ventral lung disease is suspected then dorsal recumbency would be preferable (if tolerated by the patient). This will avoid the development of atelectasis in the area of interest. If lung changes consistent with atelectasis are seen on initial CT images, the scan should be repeated with the patient positioned so that non-aerated lung lobes are non-dependent. In a case of hypostatic atelectasis the affected lung tissue will regain aeration, whereas it will remain atelectatic if pathologically altered (see Figure 12.86, p. 284)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If CT-guided biopsy or aspiration is planned, then the patient should be positioned with the biopsy side up or on the side</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Whether the dog is positioned &#x2018;head first&#x2019; or &#x2018;tail first&#x2019; is of little consequence for a thoracic CT examination other than for the anaesthetic set up (see above)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The forelegs should be extended and placed parallel to the cervical spine. Leg extension can be secured with the help of tape. Metallic monitoring devices, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) clips, should be positioned outside of the scan area.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Respiratory control is critical for a diagnostic CT examination. Due to the relatively long exposure time for each CT image, respiratory motion would otherwise render most studies non-diagnostic. There are several strategies to achieve this:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Natural respiratory pause imaging. Each exposure is taken manually at the onset of the respiratory pause at end-expiration. Tape markers on the patient can be helpful to identify the pause in the respiratory cycle. This is technically the simplest method and sometimes the only practical means to achieve a diagnostic scan. However, it is difficult to achieve consistently high image quality. It cannot be used for a helical CT scan</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Induced respiratory pause imaging. The patient should be rigorously hyperventilated for several minutes until immediately prior to the start of the scan. Most patients will then not breathe for 30&#x2013;60 seconds, which is sufficient for most CT scans to be completed. This is the most commonly used technique for helical thoracic CT scans in animals. The scan can also be interrupted should breathing commence and the manoeuvre is then repeated. Prolonged apnoea can be difficult to achieve with certain anaesthetic systems.

<title>Technique</title>
<p>Techniques for thoracic CT depend on the organ of interest. A study on a single animal may include several image sequences in order to evaluate the pulmonary parenchyma, mediastinal structures, ribs and thoracic wall.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>For <italic>mediastinal and other soft tissue structures</italic> a thick slice width (such as 5 mm) and a narrow window (window width 180&#x2013;300 HU, window level 50&#x2013;100 HU) should be used. The same is true for any contrast medium enhanced study to maximize contrast resolution (see Figures 3.1 and 3.2).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For <italic>high-resolution pulmonary parenchymal imaging</italic> a narrow slice width (1 mm), high kVp and mA, high-resolution reconstruction algorithms and small field of view should be chosen. A wide window (window width 1500&#x2013;3000 HU, window level &#x2013;800 to &#x2013;400 HU) should be used for viewing (see Figure 3.3).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>For <italic>CT screening of pulmonary metastatic disease</italic>, a high-resolution technique can be used to achieve maximal detail of potential lung nodules (1 mm slice width, pitch of 2, helical respiratory pause imaging). This technique can produce tube cooling issues and prolonged scanning time. Sufficient detail can also be achieved with thicker slices (5 mm, pitch of 1.4) but the exact threshold of detectable nodule size with the different techniques has not been established.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The tube rotation time should be kept at minimum (usually 1 second) for any thoracic study to reduce the effect of motion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Helical scanning is superior to axial scanning to achieve a maximum number of images free of motion artefact.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If axial CT is used with thin slice image techniques, it may be sufficient to leave a larger slice gap to limit examination time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If induced respiratory pause imaging is used to control respiration (see above), then it is always advantageous to scan the thorax in a caudocranial direction. This way the area of the highest respiratory motion amplitude is scanned first, when the patient is still apnoeic.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sagittal and dorsal reconstructions are very useful to assess lesions identified on transverse images if a high image quality can be achieved. The image quality of orthogonal reconstructions depends on the slice width and interval (pitch in helical CT) and is far superior with multislice CT units (Figure 3.6).</p></list-item>

<p>The image was reconstructed from a helical CT series with 1 mm slice thickness and a pitch of 1, resulting in an image resolution close to the axial plane images. The main advantages of this plane are the better alignment of the lesion with the bronchial and vascular tree and the increased viewing area.</p>

<title>CT-assisted fine-needle aspiration</title>
<p>CT-assisted fine-needle aspiration (Figure 3.7) is a valuable diagnostic tool where samples via direct or ultrasound-guided techniques cannot be obtained, such as from lesions that are surrounded by aerated lung. Compared with ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, the sampling is not performed under real-time imaging control and the set-up is more time-consuming. The manual technique involves several steps:

<title>Indications</title>
<p>The principal indication for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of thoracic disease in small animals is the evaluation of thoracic masses. MRI is of particular value for presurgical planning due to the excellent soft tissue contrast it provides and its ability to obtain images in any plane.</p>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Thoracic wall</title>
<p>MRI is indicated for investigation of thoracic wall masses. It is valuable if contemplating extensive surgery, e.g. chest wall resection (Figure 4.1).</p>
<fig>
<label>4.1</label>
<caption><title>Transverse T2-weighted image of a dog with a soft tissue sarcoma arising from the chest wall.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>A cod liver oil capsule (arrowed) has been placed over the area of swelling to aid localization. The tumour is the medium strong signal tissue adjacent to the oil capsule.</p>
</fig>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pleural space</title>
<p>MRI may be used for investigating causes of pleural effusion if a diagnosis is not reached with conventional imaging.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Mediastinum including heart and major vessels</title>
<p>Indications include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Investigation of mediastinal masses for lesion extent and involvement of major thoracic structures (Figure 4.2)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complex cardiac malformations (when diagnosis is not possible with echocardiography or if contemplating surgery)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vascular malformations.</p></list-item>

<caption><title>Dorsal plane T2-weighted image of an 11-year-old cat with dyspnoea.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>There is a cranial mediastinal mass (arrowheads), pleural fluid and lung lobe torsion (left cranial lobe). Compare the swollen, hyperintense left cranial lung lobe (arrowed) with the normal right cranial lobe (*). MRI allowed more accurate assessment of the thoracic pathology than conventional radiology or ultrasonography.</p>
</fig>
<p>The use of MRI to evaluate small animal cardiac function has been reported in experimental studies but has so far only limited clinical veterinary application. MRI allows more accurate quantification of cardiac volumes and function compared with echocardiography but is considerably more expensive. To evaluate the blood vessels MR angiography (MRA) may be used.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Airways and lungs</title>
<p>MRI of the lung is rarely performed compared with computed tomography (CT), due to an inherently low signal from lung and artefacts. Ventilation scans may be performed by using inhaled hyperpolarized inert gases, such as helium, but are not used clinically in veterinary medicine as they require specialized equipment. Lung perfusion scans may be performed using MRA but currently offer little advantage over other imaging modalities (CT, nuclear medicine or angiography) for this purpose in small animals.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>Limitations and comparison with computed tomography</title>
<p>As MRI for small animals requires general anaesthesia, its use in severe cardiac or respiratory disease is limited.</p>
<p>Whilst it is non-invasive, there are some hazards associated with MRI. Metallic implants within the patient may move or heat up and will cause artefacts if they are near or within the field of view. This is particularly important in MRI units with high field strength.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Hip replacement prostheses and bone implants rarely cause problems for thoracic MRI.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Animals with potentially mobile metal within the body (e.g. gunshot, foreign bodies) should be screened radiographically prior to MRI.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Animals with a pacemaker should not undergo MRI unless the implant is known to be MRI-compatible as the magnetic field may interfere with pacemaker function.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Microchips may cause artefacts, leading to distortion of the images in the adjacent area. This may be a problem if evaluating lesions near the thoracic spine (e.g. injection site sarcomas).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Motion artefacts (cardiac, respiratory) can be a limiting factor in thoracic MRI. Possible remedies include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fast imaging sequences (e.g. single shot techniques)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Physiological gating.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Low and mid-field systems (&#x003C;0.5 Tesla) can be used for the evaluation of thoracic masses but are limited in their capabilities for cardiovascular imaging. A comparison of CT and MRI is given in Figure 4.3.</p>
<table-4.3/>
</sec2>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Restraint and patient preparation</title>
<p>General anaesthesia is required for all MRI studies to prevent motion artefacts. There are certain requirements for general anaesthesia and patient restraint:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Special MRI-compatible (non-ferrous) monitoring and anaesthetic equipment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Peripheral venous catheter placed for administration of contrast media</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Meticulous check for and removal of extraneous metallic objects (collars, leads, harness, etc.) prior to entering the scanning room</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensuring adequate length of anaesthetic tubing and monitoring equipment for anticipated patient position.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Generally, the preferred positioning for thoracic MRI is &#x2018;tail first&#x2019; (depending upon the arrangement of the connection between the radio frequency (RF) coil and the scanner) and sternal recumbency in order to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Minimize the distance between the animal and the anaesthetic machine and prevent kinking of the breathing circuit</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Minimize dependency-related lung atelectasis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Allow best comparison between left and right hemithorax (equal atelectasis).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>For chest wall lesions, movement artefacts due to respiration may be reduced by positioning the animal in lateral recumbency with the lesion dependent. This reduces motion of the dependent surface but results in distortion of the superficial tissues. Deep-chested dogs (e.g. Great Danes, Irish Wolfhounds) usually need to be positioned in lateral recumbency to fit into the scanner. Care should be taken to ensure the animal is straight and not rotated.</p>
<p>Cats and small dogs (&#x003C;10 kg) may be positioned in sternal recumbency within an extremity coil. For medium-sized dogs (10&#x2013;20 kg) a human head coil may be used. For large dogs (&#x003E;20 kg) a torso coil is used. Dedicated surface (cardiac) coils are not required for routine imaging but may be used for cardiac imaging.</p>
<p>To aid localization a mineral oil capsule may be taped to the surface of the lesion (see Figure 4.1).</p>
<p>If physiological gating is being performed then the bellows, pulse oximeter or electrocardiogram (ECG) should be placed before sending the animal into the bore of the magnet.</p>
<p>The animal should be positioned so that the area of interest is centred within the coil and laser lights on the scanner are used to identify this landmark. For general thoracic imaging, centring just caudal to the scapula is suitable. For chest wall masses the landmark should be set on the centre of the lesion.</p>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Technique</title>
<p>A three-plane localizing scan is obtained first. If the animal is seen to be poorly positioned it should be repositioned and the localizing scan repeated. Additional slices are then prescribed from the localizer images. Images should be obtained in dorsal, sagittal and transverse planes. When prescribing slices, care should be taken to ensure that transverse slices are perpendicular and sagittal images are parallel to the long axis of the patient.</p>
<p>The choice of sequence depends upon the purpose of the study:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Standard T1- and T2-weighted fast-spin echo sequences for evaluation of thoracic masses. T2-weighted images are useful for most conditions as these have maximum soft tissue contrast</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>T1-weighted images are useful for anatomical imaging and allow the use of intravenous contrast media (gadolinium chelates) to define margins of masses and vascularized tissue</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A variety of pulse sequences (e.g. gradient&#x2013;echo, phase&#x2013;contrast sequences, true FISP) can be used to assess cardiac function or structure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fat suppression techniques (e.g. STIR sequence or spectral fat saturation) may be of benefit for the evaluation of fatty lesions and pathology involving muscle or bone.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Slice thickness and field of view will vary depending on the area of interest and patient size. Field of view should be just larger than the diameter of the body where the images are being obtained to prevent phase wrap (where tissue outwith the field of view is superimposed on tissue within the field of view). If a small field of view is wanted, oversampling (no phase wrap) can be used.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Generally 4&#x2013;5 mm slice thickness is adequate for most cats and dogs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For chest wall and mediastinal disease, ideally all images in three planes should be obtained with slices oriented to the long axis of the animal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For cardiac imaging slices are oriented to the heart to give either long- or short-axis images.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Correct identification of rib numbers may be difficult from sagittal and transverse images. A dorsal plane image, extending from the spine ventrally to include the dorsal aspect of the ribs, allows correct identification of the rib numbers (if this is important).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Motion artefacts due to respiration and pulsation from the heart and great vessels are common. Both occur predominately in the phase encoding direction and result in ghosting and severe degradation of image quality:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>For lateral chest wall lesions, dorsal plane images should have phase encoding set craniocaudal, and transverse images should have phase encoding dorsoventral</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For dorsal or ventral chest wall lesions phase encoding should be right&#x2013;left for transverse plane images. Artefacts are less common on sagittal plane images</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If peripheral thoracic lesions are being imaged, application of pre-saturation bands (satbands) over the heart reduces artefact by reducing the signal from the heart</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Motion artefacts may be more pronounced on long echo time images (T2-weighted). This may be reduced (at the expense of increasing acquisition time) by using multiple excitations (NEX)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Short echo time sequences and fast imaging (gradient&#x2013;echo, echo&#x2013;planar or single-shot) sequences reduce motion artefacts.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Respiratory motion may be minimized by using respiratory gating, where the scan acquisition is related to the respiratory cycle (Figure 4.4). This requires the use of a band with bellows attached, which is placed around the chest and detects respiratory motion. Images are obtained at set points of the respiratory cycle. This may be ineffective in smaller animals as the movement of the chest wall is too small to be detected by the bellows. A disadvantage of respiratory gating is increased scan times.</p>
<fig>

<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>This image was acquired without respiratory gating. Note the reduction in motion artefacts and better image quality in (a) compared with (b). Scan times with gating were six times longer than without gating.</p>
</fig>
<p>Cardiac gating is required for cardiac MRI. This allows data to be obtained at one point of the cardiac cycle (Figure 4.5). It may be performed using MRI-compatible electrodes connected to the gating control on the scanner or using the pulse oximeter built into the scanner. In small animals the low height of the R wave on the ECG may make it difficult for the computer to obtain accurate timing. The pulse oximeter placed on the tongue usually works and avoids the need to have ECG cables in the region of the coil. Ventilator <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>settings for frequent low-amplitude chest excursions are preferred to avoid major artefacts associated with deeper respirations.</p>

<p>Compare the large hypointense thrombus within the right pulmonary artery (arrowed) with the normal left pulmonary artery (arrowhead). This image was acquired using cardiac gating to minimize motion artefact.</p>
</fig>
<p>MRA can be performed with or without contrast media. Contrast-enhanced MRA is occasionally useful and gives better quality angiograms compared with non-contrast techniques (especially if there is turbulent or slow blood flow) as there is a greater signal to noise ratio and greater contrast compared with background tissues. If performing contrast-enhanced MRA a double or triple dose of gadolinium is used and ideally should be injected using a power injector to obtain a tight bolus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nuclear medicine, or nuclear scintigraphy, is a branch of medical imaging that uses radiopharmaceuticals (pharmaceuticals labelled to radioactive atoms) to evaluate physiological processes and diagnose a variety of diseases. Nuclear medicine differs from other imaging modalities in that it shows primarily the function of the system being investigated, as opposed to its anatomy. During scintigraphic studies, images are created using a radiation detector (the gamma camera) after the application of a radiopharmaceutical of choice (e.g. rectal, intravenous). Because scintigraphy employs radioactive compounds, radiation safety is of the utmost importance, both when handling the radiopharmaceutical dose and the animal being injected, as well as with waste products, such as urine and faeces. In small animal thoracic diagnostic nuclear medicine, the typical radiopharmaceutical dose is small (ranging between a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 740 MBq), resulting in minimal exposure from the animals and their excreta. Nevertheless, adherence to national radiation safety regulations is mandatory.</p>

<title>First pass radionuclide angiocardiography</title>
<p>This study is easy and quick to perform and does not require sedation or general anaesthesia; however, sedation may be used in particularly fractious animals. Prior to the study, radiographs of the thorax should be obtained to make sure that the animal is not in left heart failure, since left heart failure will render the study invalid. An animal with evidence of pulmonary oedema and/or pulmonary venous congestion should be treated until resolution of the decompensation, before attempting the study.</p>
<p>The radionuclide must be injected intravenously in a bolus fashion; therefore, prior to the study, a large-gauge, short-length intravenous catheter must be placed in the cephalic vein.</p>
<p>The animal is positioned in left lateral recumbency over the gamma camera and restrained by one (or two) assistants. It is vital that the animal remains still during the few seconds of the dynamic acquisition of the first pass, or the study will be non-diagnostic.</p>

<p>No sedation or anaesthesia is necessary; however, sedation may be used in particularly fractious animals.</p>
<p>It is important to assess whether the animal may have pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a relative contraindication for the use of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA, since the particles will occlude a portion of the pulmonary capillary bed and, therefore, could potentially exacerbate this condition. If pulmonary hypertension is suspected, the particle dose must be reduced as much as possible. In cases of severe pulmonary hypertension, the study risks must be weighed against the benefit of achieving a diagnosis.</p>
<p>When evaluating for PTE, radiographs of the thorax should be obtained immediately prior to the study and used in conjunction with the scintigraphic images for interpretation. This is especially important <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>because ventilation scintigraphy using inert radioactive gases or <sup>99m</sup>Tc-DTPA radioaerosol is virtually never performed in practice due to its technical difficulty and radiation safety concerns.</p>
<p>Since the MAA particles can adhere to plastic tubing, it is best to inject directly into the vein, and no intravenous catheter is needed.</p>
<p>The animal can be restrained in opposite lateral, dorsal and ventral recumbency over the gamma camera by an assistant.</p>

<title><sup>99m</sup>Tc-pertechnetate scintigraphy for evaluation of cranial mediastinal masses</title>
<p>Anaesthesia is not necessary, but sedation is generally required. If the study includes images of the thyroid using a pinhole collimator, then anaesthesia is needed. An intravenous catheter should be placed in the cephalic or saphenous vein to facilitate the administration of the radionuclide. The animal can be restrained in opposite lateral, dorsal and ventral recumbency over the gamma camera by an assistant.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that if the animal has recently undergone a contrast study with intravenous injection of iodinated contrast media, the scintigraphy will be negative because iodine reduces thyroid uptake of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-pertechnetate: a delay of 3&#x2013;4 weeks is recommended from the time of intravenous iodinated contrast media injection to the time of scintigraphy to avoid a false-negative result.</p>

<title>First pass radionuclide angiocardiography</title>
<p>The set-up for first pass radionuclide angiocardiography is easy and the acquisition time itself is short. Most commercially available nuclear medicine software have a programme that permits the calculation of QP:QS, which allows for quantification of the magnitude of the shunt. Although the precise steps for image analysis will vary slightly depending on the software used, the principle behind the analysis is the same.</p>
<p>The only requirement for the radiopharmaceutical used in this study is that it must flow passively through the central circulation of the heart and lung.<sup> 99m</sup>Tc-pertechnetate is the most commonly used radionuclide; <sup>99m</sup>Tc-DTPA or <sup>99m</sup>Tc-mebrofenin are also frequently used, especially if rapid clearance from the soft tissues is needed, for instance if the study needs to be repeated on the same day. A dose of 185&#x2013;740 MBq is adequate for a dog; 74&#x2013;185 MBq is sufficient for a cat.</p>
<p>It is necessary to set up a dynamic acquisition, with at least four (ideally eight) frames per second in order to have temporal resolution of the various phases of the cardiac cycle. A total acquisition time of 60 seconds is more than adequate. A low-energy, all-purpose collimator is used; matrix size is set at 64&#x00D7;64&#x00D7;16 or 128&#x00D7;128&#x00D7;16.</p>
<p>After positioning the patient on the gamma camera in left lateral recumbency and centring over the heart, the dynamic acquisition is started simultaneously with the bolus injection. To perform the injection, it is best to use a short extension tube connected to the intravenous catheter, and a three-way stopcock connecting the extension tube to the syringe containing the radiopharmaceutical dose and to a syringe of saline solution. The radiopharmaceutical can be loaded in the extension tube (it is important that the volume of radiopharmaceutical is no larger than the volume of the extension tube) and injected as a bolus using the saline flush.</p>
<p>Before analysing the study, it is necessary to perform a control step to ensure that the injection was performed in a bolus fashion and that the study is of acceptable quality. To do this, a region of interest (ROI) is drawn over the cranial vena cava (CrVC) from which the computer creates a time activity curve (TAC) that plots the counts in the CrVC ROI over time. An acceptable bolus shows a curve with a tall peak and a narrow base, with the width of the peak at half the maximum counts (full width half maximum, FWHM) measuring &#x003C;2 seconds (Figure 5.1).</p>
<fig>
<label>5.1</label>
<caption><title>TAC from the CrVC in a normal dog illustrating a good bolus injection. The curve was obtained by drawing a ROI over the CrVC and plotting the counts in the ROI (y axis) over time in seconds (x axis).</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>Notice the tall and narrow-based peak of the curve. The width of the peak at 50&#x0025; of the peak maximum height (full width half maximum, FWHM) is 1 second, indicating an excellent bolus.</p>
</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>The evaluation of the study starts with a visual inspection: a normal first pass study is characterized by sequential passage of the radionuclide through the CrVC, right atrium, right ventricle (dextrophase), pulmonary arteries, lung, pulmonary veins (lung phase), left atrium, left ventricle and aorta (levophase). During the levophase, it should be possible to see the aorta clearly, because the lungs should be almost completely clear of the radiopharmaceutical (Figure 5.2).</p>
<p>In a left-to-right shunt, the lungs do not clear because of recirculation of the radiopharmaceutical through the shunt into the pulmonary circulation. It should be noted that incomplete clearance of the lungs is also observed when the animal is in left heart failure, therefore evaluation of thoracic radiographs prior to the study is mandatory to rule out this differential. In addition, if the injection of radiopharmaceutical is performed too slowly, the effect will be to simulate slow lung clearance; moreover, if too much pressure is used during the injection, the bolus can split between the cephalic or omobrachial vein and the axillobrachial vein, creating a double peak in the TAC, which may mimic a recirculation peak (Figure 5.3). In a right-to-left shunt, the aorta becomes visible at the same time as the pulmonary arteries.</p>
<p>Quantitative analysis is performed by calculating the QP:QS. This is done by drawing a ROI over the caudodorsal lung field, avoiding the aorta, main pulmonary vessels and liver, and asking the computer to create a TAC that displays the lung counts over time. In a normal animal, there will be a peak as the bolus travels through the lungs, followed by a rapid fall (Figure 5.4). In an animal with a left-to-right shunt, a second peak is visible immediately after the first one, <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>representing the recirculation of radionuclide into the lungs through the shunt (Figure 5.5). The computer software can then calculate a ratio of the area under the first pulmonary curve (QP) and the second recirculation (systemic) curve (QS). In a normal animal, the QP:QS ratio is &#x003C;1.2. It has been shown that the QP:QS ratio correlates well with percent of shunt. A QP:QS ratio of about 3, for instance, corresponds to a shunt fraction of about 50&#x0025;.</p>
<fig>
<label>5.2</label>
<caption><title>Left lateral images illustrating a normal first pass radionuclide angiogram in a dog.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The images are taken at a rate of 4 frames per second, representing the 3 seconds immediately after the intravenous injection of <sup>99m</sup>Tc DTPA. The radionuclide outlines the CrVC, (top left), right heart, lungs, left heart and aorta. Notice that the margins of the aorta are distinct and the lung field clears completely (last two images, bottom right) during the levophase.</p>

<label>5.3</label>
<caption><title>TAC from the CrVC in a normal dog illustrating a split bolus.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>This is an example of a biphasic bolus: the first peak in the TAC (A) is followed by a second peak (B), which may be erroneously interpreted as a recirculation peak compatible with a left-to-right shunt. This mistake is easily avoided by evaluating the TAC in conjunction with the dynamic acquisition.</p>

<caption><title>Pulmonary TAC (blue) in a normal dog showing an initial increase and successive sharp fall of the pulmonary counts as the radioactive bolus passes through the pulmonary circulation (QP).</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The curve in red represents systemic activity in the lungs (QS), which is due to blood flow in the bronchial branches of the broncho-oesophageal artery. The dotted lines represent fitted curves, which were generated by the computer during the analysis and calculation of QP:QS ratio. The image in the top right corner illustrates positioning of the pulmonary ROI in the caudodorsal aspect of the lungs.</p>
</fig>
<p>If the nuclear medicine computer does not have software for QP:QS analysis, an alternative procedure is to calculate the C2:C1 ratio. To calculate the C2:C1 ratio, a ROI is placed in the caudodorsal lung field in the same way as for QP:QS analysis, and a lung TAC is created. From the TAC, it is necessary to identify three points: C1, the maximum pulmonary counts, obtained at the peak of the pulmonary curve; Tmax, the time from the initial appearance of the bolus until the peak of the pulmonary curve (C1); and C2, the pulmonary counts at 2&#x00D7;Tmax (Figure 5.6). A normal C1:C2 ratio is &#x003C;0.5 (the counts at C2 have to be less than half the counts at C1). While this method is easy to use, it is less accurate than the QP:QS ratio in distinguishing normal animals from animals that have a left-to-right shunt; that is, C2:C1 ratios in normal animals overlap with those of animals with left-to-right shunts to a much greater degree than the respective QP:QS values.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pulmonary scintigraphy</title>
<p>Pulmonary scintigraphy for the evaluation of PTE and right-to-left shunts is easily performed and requires only the acquisition of static images; no particular software is necessary for image analysis.</p>
<p>Pulmonary perfusion imaging using the radiopharmaceutical <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA is based on physical blockade of the MAA particles in the first capillary bed encountered after intravenous injection. Because the MAA particles have a mean diameter of 10&#x2013;40 &#x00B5;m, in a normal animal they lodge in the pulmonary capillaries <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>and their distribution is proportional to blood flow. The particles have a biological half-life of 4&#x2013;6 hours, after which they are removed by pulmonary macrophages. The capillary embolization is therefore reversible.</p>
<fig>
<label>5.5</label>
<caption><title>Pulmonary TAC in a dog with a left-to-right shunt.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The curve was generated in the same way as the one in Figure 5.4. Notice the large systemic peak (QS), indicating recirculation of the radiopharmaceutical through the left-to-right shunt.</p>
</fig>
<fig>
<label>5.6</label>
<caption><title>TAC in a dog with a left-to-right shunt, showing the reference points necessary for calculation of the C2:C1 ratio.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>C1 is the point of maximum pulmonary counts; Tmax is the time after the beginning of the pulmonary upslope at which C1 occurs; C2 is the point on the curve at 2xTmax. The C2:C1 ratio in normal dogs should be &#x003C;0.5.</p>
</fig>
<p>A dose of 17.5 MBq is adequate for a cat or small dog, with up to 74 MBq for a large dog. For this particular radiopharmaceutical, it is important to estimate how many particles will be injected into the patient. Most commercially available kits contain 4&#x2013;12 million particles: the typical dose in a 70 kg human patient is 1/10 of the kit, which is estimated to result in embolization of &#x003C;0.1&#x0025; of the pulmonary capillaries. In small animals, no more than 1/10 to 1/20 of the kit should be used. It is especially important to use the smallest possible particle dose when evaluating for a possible right-to-left shunt, and when pulmonary hypertension is suspected. In cases of documented severe pulmonary hypertension, the study is contraindicated. It is also better not to perform the study if adequate particle dilution cannot be reached, for instance in a very small dog or cat.</p>
<p>As the particles remain in position for several hours, the intravenous injection can be performed away from the gamma camera. It is better to image 1&#x2013;5 minutes after the injection because as time elapses, some particles begin to be removed by macrophages, and the label begins to dissociate.</p>
<p>The radiopharmaceutical should be injected directly into the cephalic or saphenous vein; <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA has a tendency to form clots when mixed with blood in the syringe prior to injection, which can happen if the operator has difficulty in finding a vein and blood is withdrawn and allowed to remain in the syringe for a short period of time. The <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA clot does not represent a danger for the animal, but it will localize to the lungs creating an artefactual &#x2018;hot spot&#x2019; that can be confusing during image interpretation (Figure 5.7). It is best to perform the injection with the animal in sternal recumbency to avoid collapse of the recumbent lung and ensure even distribution to the lung fields; it is important to remember that the distribution is proportional to blood flow.</p>
<fig>
<label>5.7</label>
<caption><title>Pulmonary perfusion study in a dog presented for evaluation of possible PTE.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>Note the small but intense focus of activity in the apex of the right cranial lung lobe (arrowed). This was a <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA clot.</p>
</fig>
<p>When investigating possible right-to-left shunts, static right and left lateral, ventral and dorsal images of the whole body should be acquired. When the study is performed to evaluate for PTE, images are limited to the thorax and include additional oblique views. Matrix size is set at 256&#x00D7;256&#x00D7;16. Images should be acquired for 250,000&#x2013;500,000 counts. A low-energy, all-purpose collimator is adequate.</p>
<p>In a normal animal, radioactivity is distributed exclusively to the lungs fields which have homogenous intensity (Figure 5.8). In animals with right-to-left shunts, radioactivity is seen in the systemic circulation and is especially noticeable in the capillaries of the renal cortices and cerebral hemispheres. In patients with PTE, wedge-shaped pleural-based perfusion defects are present, with the corresponding radiographs being normal or occasionally showing focal oligaemia and smaller than normal pulmonary vessels. Shunt fraction can be easily calculated by dividing the total extrapulmonary counts by the total body counts.</p>

<title><sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA scintigraphy for evaluation of mucociliary function</title>
<p>Scintigraphy with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA can also be used for the evaluation of mucociliary function in cases of suspected ciliary dyskinesia. The study is easy to perform, does not require specific software for image analysis, but does require general anaesthesia.</p>
<p>The animal is positioned in ventral recumbency on a table and the gamma camera positioned immediately dorsal to it and centred over the thorax. A low-energy, all-purpose collimator is adequate. A short ET tube must be used so that the tube does not interfere with <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA movement; a 90 degree connector with port is ideal to connect the ET tube to the anaesthetic machine.</p>
<p>Two external radioactive markers (<sup>57</sup>Co or <sup>99m</sup>Tc) are placed along the side of the animal, one at the level of the caudal margin of the scapula or fifth intercostal space (which corresponds to the location of the carina), and the other 20 cm cranially. These markers will assist in the accurate deposition of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA droplet.</p>
<p>A sleeved catheter must be used to deposit a droplet of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA at the tracheal bifurcation: a 10 Fr male urinary catheter with the tip removed works well as the outer sleeve, and a 5 Fr catheter can be used as the inner catheter. A small droplet of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA (&#x003C;30 MBq in 30 &#x00B5;l volume) is aspirated into the inner catheter; the inner catheter is then withdrawn into the outer catheter to avoid contamination of the trachea during positioning. The catheter is then advanced into the ET tube through the port at the right angle connection, or the anaesthetic machine is momentarily disconnected to allow placement of the catheter. The catheter is advanced until the radioactive <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA droplet is just cranial to the level of the caudal external radioactive marker (level of the carina); the persistence scope is used to assess the location of the catheter with respect to the external radioactive markers. The internal catheter is then advanced about 1 cm beyond the outer sleeve and a small volume of air is injected, resulting in deposition of the radioactive droplet in the trachea. At this point the inner catheter is retracted into the outer catheter, the catheters are removed together from the trachea and, if necessary, the anaesthetic machine is reconnected.</p>
<p>A series of 60 seconds dorsal static images is then acquired, starting just after radiopharmaceutical deposition, and then every 5 minutes for a total of 40 minutes afterwards. Matrix size is set at 256&#x00D7;256&#x00D7;16.</p>
<p>In a normal animal, the radiopharmaceutical droplet is cleared by the mucociliary apparatus and moves cranially as a discrete &#x2018;hot spot&#x2019; (Figure 5.9). Movement usually starts 1&#x2013;2 minutes after deposition. Sometimes a residual lower-intensity focus remains at the original site of deposition. In an animal with non-functional cilia, there will be no movement throughout the entire study. This is an &#x2018;all or nothing&#x2019; type of evaluation: either the droplet moves, or it does not. The velocity at which the droplet moves varies greatly from animal to animal, even in healthy dogs and cats in the same age groups.</p>

<title><sup>99m</sup>Tc-pertechnetate scintigraphy for evaluation of cranial mediastinal masses</title>
<p><sup>99m</sup>Tc-pertechnetate scintigraphy can be used in the evaluation of cranial mediastinal masses, to determine whether a mass detected radiographically and/or ultrasonographically is thyroidal in origin. The technique is the same as for thyroid scintigraphy.</p>
<p>The administered dose is 74&#x2013;185 MBq of <sup>99m</sup>Tc pertechnetate in the dog and 37&#x2013;148 MBq in the cat. A low-energy, all-purpose collimator is used; matrix size is set at 256&#x00D7;256&#x00D7;16. Image acquisition is best performed 20&#x2013;30 minutes after injection. The animal is placed over the gamma camera and opposite lateral, ventral and possibly dorsal static images of the thorax are acquired for a minimum of 250,000 counts. A mass of thyroidal origin will show radionuclide uptake much like the thyroid gland does.</p>

<title>General indications and limitations</title>
<p>Interventional radiology (IR) involves the use of contemporary imaging modalities, such as radiography, fluoroscopy and computed tomography (CT) to gain access to specific structures in order to deliver different materials for therapeutic purposes. These techniques are routinely used in human medicine; despite potential applications, however, these procedures have not yet been widely adopted in veterinary medicine. This chapter focuses on the use of IR techniques for tracheal diseases. The relatively high morbidity and mortality rates associated with surgery of the cervical and intrathoracic trachea make IR techniques particularly well suited for this location.</p>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Advantages</title>
<p>The use of IR techniques in veterinary patients offers a number of advantages compared with more traditional therapies:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Minimally invasive procedures reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality, and shorten anaesthesia and hospitalization times. Some less equipment-intensive procedures can result in reduced costs as well</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Alternative treatment options for certain patients in which traditional therapies have failed or are unavailable, declined or contraindicated.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Disadvantages</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Some degree of technical expertise required.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Specialized equipment required.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The majority of IR procedures performed within the trachea are not equipment-intensive, and most are carried out on non-emergency cases so the necessary equipment can be purchased when needed. In addition, for those who do not have fluoroscopy readily available, some of these techniques have been performed with endoscopic guidance or rapidly obtained digital radiography alone.</p>
</sec2>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Equipment</title>
<p>As tracheal IR procedures are performed through the endotracheal (ET) tube, traditional sterile operating rooms are not required. The majority of these types of procedures can be performed in clean radiography/angiography suites whilst wearing sterile latex gloves. In general, the largest diameter ET tube possible should be selected (at least 4 mm inner diameter) to facilitate unrestricted passage of devices through the tube whilst permitting simultaneous oxygen delivery and ventilation during the procedure. An ET tube with a radiopaque line or markers should always be used when possible, to help avoid inadvertent deployment of stents within the tube. The use of sterile ET tubes is debatable and not routinely required by the author as the trachea is not generally considered a sterile environment.</p>
<p>Radiation exposure during conventional or C-arm fluoroscopy can be substantial. The operator should review radiation safety guidelines, minimize exposure time and maximize shielding and distance from the beam as well as X-ray beam collimation. Those present during the procedure should always wear full lead gowns and lead thyroid shields, and only stay in the non-shielded parts of the room if their presence is essential during the radiological exposure. A traditional fluoroscopy unit is sufficient for the majority of tracheal IR procedures currently performed. A C arm fluoroscopy unit has the advantage of mobility of the image intensifier, permitting multiple tangential views without moving the patient.</p>
<p>A general review of IR equipment is beyond the scope of this chapter, but a brief discussion of certain devices is necessary to understand how these procedures are performed:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Guidewires</italic>. These are flexible, often angle-tipped and hydrophilic (slippery) coated wires used to gain access to different structures under direct fluoroscopic visualization</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Catheters</italic>. These are long (typically 65&#x2013;100 cm) </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>	and designed to be advanced over a guidewire. For IR procedures, &#x2018;marker catheters&#x2019; with radiopaque centimetre markings are typically used in order to calculate radiographic magnification and determine the length and diameter of both the normal and narrowed tracheal segments</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Stents</italic>. These devices are designed to hold the tracheal lumen open in the presence of tracheal collapse, stenosis or malignant obstruction. Self-expanding metallic stents (SEMSs) are most commonly used in veterinary patients. These devices are typically made of nitinol <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>(nickel&#x2013;titanium alloy) or stainless steel and are compressed on to very narrow delivery systems, which can be introduced through the ET tube and placed across a narrowed area. Upon release, the stent resumes its original dimensions within the tracheal lumen (Figure 6.1)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Snares/stone baskets</italic>. These devices are similar to their endoscopic counterparts (and are often used interchangeably) and are used to retrieve tracheal foreign bodies under fluoroscopic guidance.</p></list-item>

<p>Mild to moderate cases of tracheal collapse can usually be controlled with medications including anti-inflammatories, cough suppressants, sedatives/tranquillizers and bronchodilators. In addition, weight loss, restricted exercise and removal of second-hand smoke or inhaled allergens can further palliate symptoms. Those patients that have failed to respond to aggressive medical and environmental management, and have had other causes of respiratory disease either treated or ruled out, become candidates for surgical or interventional treatment. The decision to perform surgery or stenting is a complicated and unresolved one. Regardless, all animals should receive aggressive medical and environmental management before considering either of these treatment options. Patients must be treated on an individual basis; however, some basic guidelines can be used:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Surgical rings should be considered when cervical tracheal collapse is present</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intraluminal stent placement should be considered in a geriatric patient or in a patient with excessive co-morbidities (extensive cardiac or pulmonary disease, endocrinopathies, etc.) in which prolonged anaesthesia or healing could preclude more invasive surgery</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Avoid intraluminal stent placement in younger animals as long-term follow-up (&#x003E;5 years) in tracheal stented animals has not yet been completed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If only intrathoracic tracheal collapse is present then surgery is unlikely to resolve the problem and will probably be associated with excessive morbidity; therefore, an intraluminal stent should be considered</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patients with both cervical and intrathoracic tracheal collapse can be managed with either a single long stent spanning both segments, or with surgical rings in the cervical trachea and a stent for the intrathoracic trachea</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use of intraluminal tracheal stents in patients with bronchial collapse is currently debatable. Placement of stents within collapsing mainstem bronchi will not address collapse of more distal bronchi so are not typically performed; however, tracheal stents in these patients may offer significant palliation.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Various surgical techniques have been described; however, the currently recommended surgical therapy for patients with extrathoracic tracheal collapse is extraluminal polypropylene ring prostheses; this is associated with a relatively high morbidity and mortality.</p>

<title>Technique</title>
<p>A complete description of the technique used for tracheal stent placement is beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Extent of collapse</title>
<p>Real-time fluoroscopy should be performed in the awake patient to determine the extent of collapse. When possible, coughing is induced to observe the results of the extreme dynamic airway pressures normally experienced by the patient. Bronchial collapse can often be identified with fluoroscopy as well and should be noted when present.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Patient preparation</title>
<p>A rapid induction and recovery are preferred when possible. Premedications are not routinely used; however, an antitussive/sedative combination can be effective if intravenous catheterization causes excessive anxiety and/or distress. Preoxygenation of the patient is routinely performed and, unless contraindicated, a combination of intravenous propofol and diazepam is used with minimal inhalant anaesthesia concentrations. Perioperative antibiotic use for these procedures is debatable and chosen on an individual basis. Unless contraindicated, these patients typically receive one perioperative dose of dexamethasone (0.1&#x2013;0.25 mg/kg i.v.).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheal and stent sizing</title>
<p>The patient is placed under general anaesthesia and positioned in lateral recumbency. A hydrophilic guidewire and marker catheter combination are placed within the mouth and the guidewire is <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>advanced down the oesophagus under fluoroscopic guidance. The marker catheter is advanced over the wire and positioned within the oesophagus over the pre-determined level of tracheal narrowing. Positive pressure ventilation of 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O is maintained to achieve maximal tracheal dilation while a radiograph is obtained. The radiopaque catheter markings are used to extrapolate the maximal tracheal diameter and the length of stent necessary, accounting for radiographic magnification (Figure 6.2a).</p>
<fig>

<p>(a) Using positive pressure ventilation and an oesophageal marker catheter, measurements are taken to establish the maximal tracheal diameter. (b) The stent delivery system is advanced into the trachea. Note that the cervical and intrathoracic trachea are in line to facilitate unimpeded passage of the stent. (c) Restoration of a patent trachea immediately following placement of an intraluminal tracheal stent.</p>
</fig>
<p>The tracheal stent chosen should have a diameter approximately 15&#x2013;20&#x0025; greater than the maximal tracheal diameter and a length approximately 2 cm longer than the area of narrowing (to span approximately 1 cm cranial and 1 cm caudal to the area of collapse).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Stent placement</title>
<p>Deployment properties vary depending upon the design of the stent. Some stents shorten significantly upon deployment and some stents are reconstrainable to some degree (can be recaptured within the delivery system before full deployment). The operator MUST read the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions in order to understand the specific properties of the stent being used for a particular case. Once the stent has been chosen, it is removed from its packaging using sterile technique and prepared and flushed with saline according to manufacturer recommendations. A right-angle bronchoscope adapter is attached to the ET tube to facilitate unrestricted passage of the stent delivery system through the tube while maintaining the anaesthetic circuit (Figure 6.3). The constrained, radiopaque stent is easily visualized under fluoroscopy. Once the distal end of the stent has been positioned appropriately, stent deployment can proceed (see Figure 6.2b). Following stent deployment, the delivery system is carefully removed under fluoroscopic guidance to avoid excessive contact with the unconstrained stent. Subsequent radiographs are necessary to document the final position of the stent within the trachea (see Figure 6.2c).</p>

</fig>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Recovery</title>
<p>The patient typically recovers in an intensive care unit setting and is provided with supplemental oxygenation as needed. Butorphanol (0.1&#x2013;0.2 mg/kg i.v.) and/or acepromazine (0.005&#x2013;0.01 mg/kg i.v.) are often useful to facilitate a smooth recovery.</p>
</sec3>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Postoperative care and follow-up</title>
<p>Patients are routinely discharged 1 or 2 days after stenting with a 3&#x2013;6-week tapering dose of prednisone (initial dose of 1&#x2013;2 mg/kg/day orally), continued anti-tussive therapy (hydrocodone 0.25 mg/kg orally q6&#x2013;12h or higher doses if tolerated) and a course of broad-spectrum, oral antibiotics. Owners should anticipate an initial dry cough that improves over the following 3&#x2013;4 weeks. Aggressive medical management of coughing is imperative for a good long-term outcome and the majority of patients will require life-long medication following tracheal stenting. The initial recheck examination is approximately 2 weeks after stenting or sooner if problems arise. Repeat examinations are performed regularly (every 3&#x2013;6 months if possible, sooner if the patient&#x2019;s clinical signs worsen).</p>
</sec2>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Malignant or benign airway obstruction</title>
<p>Veterinary patients can present with advanced stages of malignancy in which traditional therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy are associated with excessive morbidity, cost or poor <xref ref-type="page" id="page_"/>outcome. Presenting clinical signs may be associated with the tumour location and subsequent local effects rather than the systemic effects of the tumour burden, e.g. a tracheal tumour resulting in subsequent airway obstruction (Figure 6.4). Benign conditions can also result in subsequent tracheal stricture formation, leading to progressive airway obstruction. The techniques described above have been used for the treatment of tracheal malignancies or stenoses secondary to trauma when surgical procedures were declined, not indicated, or expected to result in excessive morbidity or mortality. The author has placed stents for intrinsic malignant tracheal obstructions; however, tracheal stents could also provide palliation for extrinsic compression of the airways.</p>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheal foreign bodies</title>
<p>IR techniques are useful for retrieval of obstructive tracheal or bronchial foreign bodies, particularly in very small patients where surgery or endoscopy would be either dangerous or impossible. Occasionally, tracheal diameter restrictions require extubation before tracheoscopy/bronchoscopy can be performed. The endoscopes used are often occlusive in these small patients, impairing adequate ventilation. The techniques described above allow passage of very narrow snares or stone baskets through a bronchoscope adapter and ET tube while a complete anaesthetic circuit is maintained (Figure 6.5).</p>

<title>Radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>A thorough understanding of anatomy is an essential part of diagnostic imaging of the heart and cardiovascular system. This section covers the normal physiological and radiographic anatomy of the heart and the major vessels. An introduction to performing radiographic cardiac mensuration is also provided. The following section on interpretive principles covers the radiographic assessment of cardiac chamber enlargement, major vessel enlargement and differential diagnoses.</p>
<p>A full discussion of the ultrasonographic anatomy of the heart is beyond the scope of this manual. Chapter 2 provides information on performing an echocardiographic examination.</p>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Basic cardiac anatomy</title>
<p>The heart is the largest mediastinal organ and its anatomy is complex. The heart develops from paired endocardial tubes that arise from splanchnic mesoderm. These gradually fuse and undergo elongation, various dilatations and constrictions, and finally partition into chambers to form the heart. A full description of the embryological origin of the heart is beyond the scope of this chapter, but a good understanding of cardiac formation will improve understanding of congenital heart disease.</p>
<p>Partitioning of the heart results in four chambers (right and left atria and right and left ventricles) and two great arteries (the aorta and main pulmonary artery):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Blood enters the right atrium (RA) from the cranial and caudal venae cavae and the coronary sinus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blood leaves the right ventricle (RV) via the main pulmonary artery</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blood enters the left atrium (LA) from the pulmonary veins</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blood leaves the left ventricle (LV) via the aorta.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Valves divide the chambers. Each valve has a fibrous annulus and a number of cusps or leaflets. The atria are separated from the ventricles by atrioventricular valves: the mitral valve on the left and the tricuspid valve on the right. Both atrioventricular valves have two cusps and the term &#x2018;tricuspid&#x2019; is a misnomer derived from human terminology. The ventricles are separated from the major arteries by semilunar valves (both have three cusps); the aortic on the left and the pulmonic on the right.</p>
<p>The four chambers of the heart are encased within the pericardium or pericardial sac. There are two layers forming the pericardium:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The <italic>fibrous</italic> pericardium &#x2013; a strong external layer</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The <italic>serous</italic> pericardium &#x2013; a thin lining that covers the heart. This is divided into parietal and visceral layers and there is a small amount of lubricating fluid between these layers.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The heart itself is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries. The left and right main coronary arteries arise from the root of the aorta. Venous drainage is via the coronary veins and the coronary sinus.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Normal cardiac radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>The heart dominates a thoracic radiograph as it is the largest single soft tissue opacity in the thorax. It sits within the mediastinum from approximately the third to the sixth intercostal space. The larger, more dorsal part of the heart is known as the <italic>base</italic> and the smaller, more ventral part is known as the <italic>apex</italic>.</p>
<p>In the lateral view the apex is formed by the interventricular septum (IVS). The heart lies at an angle within the thorax (easily seen on the lateral view) with the apex positioned more caudally than the base. The apex usually points towards the <italic>left</italic> on a dorsoventral/ventrodorsal (DV/VD) view. Variation in the location of the apex on a DV/VD view may be extrinsic (e.g. due to alteration in lung volume) or intrinsic (a congenital malpositioning of the heart). The latter may be an incidental finding or associated with other pathological abnormalities (e.g. situs inversus in Kartagener&#x2019;s syndrome) (Figures 7.1 and 7.2).</p>
<p>The actual outline of the heart is not seen on a radiograph. Instead, the term <italic>cardiac silhouette</italic> is used to include the heart, pericardium, pericardial contents (such as fat and a small amount of fluid) and the origin of the aorta and main pulmonary artery. This is in contrast to an echocardiographic examination where the heart, origin of the major vessels, pericardium and pericardial contents are seen as separate structures. The outline of the cardiac silhouette is smooth, and details such as the coronary grooves and the separation of atria from the ventricles are <italic>not seen</italic>. The coronary arteries and veins are also not seen radiographically. However, it is possible to infer the location of the major chambers on a radiograph and to identify pathological changes in their size to some extent (see below).</p>
<table-7.1/>
<p>The central and ventral margins of the cardiac silhouette are easily outlined on a radiograph as these areas are surrounded by contrasting air in the lungs. It is not possible to outline the margins of the heart in the area of the heart base as the surrounding soft tissues, i.e. the major blood vessels (aorta, main pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins) and lymph nodes, have the same radiographic opacity. It is often difficult radiographically to appreciate changes and pathology in this region, and ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) are useful as alternative imaging modalities.</p>
<p>Many factors alter the appearance of a normal cardiac silhouette on a radiograph and this is a major source of misdiagnosis and confusion in thoracic radiography. These include tremendous variation with <italic>breed</italic>, as well as variation with respiratory phase, age and body condition and radiographic view (see below).</p>
<fig>
<label>7.2</label>

<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The cardiac silhouette and apex are located more in the right hemithorax than in the left and there is no evidence to suggest that this is associated with a mediastinal shift. Note the normal aorta (arrowed) on the left and the gastric fundus (St) also seen on the left; there is no suggestion of a situs inversus in this dog.</p>

<title>Identifying the cardiac chambers</title>
<p>The internal chambers of the heart and the lumens of the great vessels can only be visualized on a radiograph with the administration of positive contrast media. This is known as angiocardiography (see Chapter 1). However, it is possible to use the location of the borders of the various chambers to assess cardiac or great vessel enlargement on a standard radiographic series.</p>
<p>Normal angiocardiograms are very useful in understanding the location of the chambers within the shadow of the cardiac silhouette (Figures 7.3 and 7.4). These have been used to formulate useful diagrams showing the radiographic location of the cardiac chambers (Figures 7.5 and 7.6).</p>
<p>The presence of pericardial effusion usually precludes the evaluation of changes in specific cardiac chambers.</p>
<p>Some basic rules help in the assessment of cardiac chambers:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In the dog the LV and LA are located on the left and caudal aspect of the heart; the RV and RA are located on the right and cranial aspect of the heart</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The position of the cardiac apex can be used to separate the right and left sides of the heart</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On a lateral view the RV is cranial to the apex and on a VD/DV view it is to the right. The reverse is true for the LV</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The exact apical point can be difficult to determine due to the variation in cardiac position. This can sometimes make evaluation of left- <italic>versus</italic> right-sided enlargement difficult</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The two atria are located dorsal to the level of the caudal vena cava (CdVC) on a lateral view</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The dorsal and caudodorsal borders of the LA do not have a distinct outline as the pulmonary veins enter in this area and the right pulmonary artery also overlaps this region.</p></list-item>

<p>Many factors can alter the appearance of the normal heart on a radiograph. It is extremely important to be aware of the influence of these factors to avoid the misdiagnosis of normal anatomical variation as disease. These include breed, pericardial fat, age, body position, respiratory phase and cardiac cycle.</p>

<title>Breed</title>
<p>The canine heart varies tremendously between different dog breeds; breed-associated conformational variation is the single most important cause of variation in the normal canine cardiac silhouette. A basic outline of these differences is shown in Figures 7.9 and 7.10; however, there are many more variations that cannot be listed here. A good understanding of these differences is paramount to allow better cardiac assessment in thoracic radiography. It may be useful to build up a collection of normal thoracic radiographs of different breeds for easy reference.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pericardial fat</title>
<p>An incorrect diagnosis of cardiomegaly is often made in animals with a large amount of <italic>pericardial fat</italic> (see also Figure 1.24, p. 15). Pericardial fat contributes to the overall size of the cardiac silhouette but it is often possible to identify the presence of fat on careful inspection. Pericardial fat has a lower opacity compared with the heart and often the cardiac margin is not as sharp. The latter is due to the gradual change in opacity from soft tissue (heart) to fat to air-filled lung, rather than the sharp soft tissue&#x2013;air interface seen in thinner animals. Altering radiographic technique may also assist in identification of pericardial fat.</p>
<p>In the cat, pericardial fat is seen better in DV/VD rather than lateral radiographs. Pericardial fat should be suspected if a large amount of falciform fat is present, and may have a characteristic triangular corner on the right cranial margin of the cardiac silhouette on the DV/VD view (Figure 7.11).</p>

<p>(a) Lateral and (b) DV radiographs of a normal Golden Retriever. This breed often appears to have right-sided cardiomegaly on the lateral view due to the large amount of sternal contact (similar to wide shallow-chested dog breeds) and the rectangular shape of the cardiac silhouette. On the DV view the cardiac size appears normal and the apex is moderately displaced into the left hemithorax. The cardiac silhouette varies markedly between different dog breeds. (c) Lateral radiograph of a normal Dobermann. The cardiac silhouette is extremely upright due to the deep narrow-chested nature of this breed. (d) DV radiograph of a normal Greyhound. The cardiac silhouette is very rounded in shape (compared with b) and the apex lies in the midline.</p>

<p>Note the triangular soft tissue opacity border effacing the right side of the cardiac silhouette (arrowed). This is due to a large amount of pericardial fat (even though it appears as a soft tissue opacity and should not be confused with pathology). A CT examination confirmed that no lung changes were present in this cat.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>In about 40&#x0025; of older cats the heart has a more horizontal, cranially sloping position.</p>
</fig>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Age</title>
<p>Young dogs appear to have large hearts. This is, in part, due to the relatively small size of the thoracic cavity. Thus, it is particularly important to take into account shape changes as well as overall cardiac size in younger animals.</p>
<p>About 40&#x0025; of cats over 10 years old have a cranially sloping cardiac silhouette with increased sternal contact (Figure 7.12). The reason for this is poorly understood and no association with increased cardiac size has been found. It is considered likely to be associated with age-related changes in thoracic conformation.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Body position</title>
<p>Variation in body position will cause variations in the appearance of the cardiac silhouette due to the effects of gravity. Consistency in the radiographic technique is important in assessment of sequential radiographs and helps to avoid misinterpretation. Generally right lateral and DV radiographs are acquired for radiographic assessment of cardiac disease (see Chapter 1).</p>
<p>Regardless of view, the cardiac silhouette is always slightly larger than the heart itself due to the effects of magnification. Specific changes in the appearance of the canine cardiac silhouette on different radiographic views are given in Figure 7.13 (see also Figures 1.27, p. 17 and 1.29, p. 18).</p>
<table-7.13/>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Respiratory phase</title>
<p>Expiratory radiographs create a false impression of cardiomegaly as the overall thoracic size is decreased, whilst the cardiac size stays the same (for examples of inspiratory and expiratory radiographs see Figure 12.9, p. 246). Sternal contact increases at expiration, which exacerbates the impression of cardiomegaly; there is also a small but real increase in cardiac size during expiration.</p>
<p>At expiration the cardiac silhouette can be more difficult to outline cranially due to adjacent mediastinal fat and caudally due to overlapping of the diaphragm. In addition, loss of air content in the lung tissue contacting the cardiac silhouette creates a surrounding hazy indistinct zone.</p>
<p>The effects of all of these changes are exaggerated in older, obese and shallow-breathing dogs.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cardiac cycle</title>
<p>Variations due to cardiac cycle seldom cause major changes or radiographic misinterpretation. They are most easily seen in large-breed dogs and dogs with a slow heart rate.</p>
<p>Most radiographs are exposed during ventricular diastole simply because it is longer than systole. Near the end of ventricular systole the atrial borders can be rounded and bulging and the ventricles may appear as slightly smaller with a narrow &#x2018;V&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape (Figure 7.14). On VD/DV views the main pulmonary artery can be more prominent in systole. One report suggested that there was less alteration in shape due to cardiac cycle on the VD view than the DV view in cats.</p>
</sec3>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Measuring the cardiac silhouette</title>
<p>It is important to be able to assess cardiac size radiographically and many techniques have evolved in order to do this. Note that radiographs are often inaccurate in the assessment of heart size and identification of specific chamber enlargement. Ultrasonography remains the gold standard for chamber size assessment (see Chapter 2).</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Guidelines for cardiac size</title>
<p>Numerous papers have been published on the subject of quantifying the normal heart size and various methods are in use. These techniques have many limitations and should only be used in combination with a good understanding of the normal sources of variation in the cardiac silhouette. A good general principle is that the heart should be considered radiographically normal unless there is an obvious change in size or shape. Note also that a radiographically normal heart by no means excludes cardiac disease.</p>

<title>Vertebral heart score/vertebral heart size</title>
<p>A novel system of cardiac measurement was proposed in 1995, which aimed to circumvent the limitations in other methods attributable to inherent breed variation in cardiac size. It is called the vertebral (or Buchanan) heart score (VHS). In this technique the long and short axes of the cardiac silhouette are measured on a lateral view and totalled. They are then scaled against the thoracic vertebral column (Figures 7.15 and 7.16).</p>
<p>The VHS is useful for those new to evaluating cardiac size on radiographs and also for the sequential assessment of cardiac size on repeat radiographs of the same patient. It has not been proven to be superior to subjective assessment. The suggested mean value for dogs in the original multibreed study was 9.7 &#x00B1; 0.5v (8.5&#x2013;10.5v) (v: vertebrae). However, considerable breed variation exists even in the VHS, and later studies have established breed-specific normals (see Figure 7.16b).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Trachea and carina position</title>
<p>The location of the trachea and carina can be useful in assessing cardiac size and chamber enlargement (Figure 7.17). On a lateral radiograph the trachea diverges from the thoracic spine. The angle of divergence is fairly standard amongst cat breeds but shows variation between dog breeds. The greatest angle is seen in deep-chested dogs, whereas in shallow-chested breeds the trachea may be almost parallel to the spine. This should not be erroneously interpreted as representing cardiac enlargement.</p>
<p>Just cranial to the tracheal bifurcation there is a normal <italic>ventral bend</italic> in the trachea (Figure 7.18). This is often lost in animals with left-sided cardiac enlargement; however, it may not be present in normal, shallow, round-chested dog breeds.</p>

<caption><title>Basic principles of tracheal and bronchial displacement on the lateral radiograph.</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
<p>The positions of the trachea, carina and caudal mainstem bronchi can be very useful to assess cardiac chamber enlargement. In this series of figures the changes in tracheal and bronchial position on a lateral radiograph are illustrated for various conditions. Note that there is also variation in tracheal position between different breeds of dogs. (a) Normal. The trachea and caudal mainstem bronchi have a gentle ventral divergence from the thoracic spine. Note the normal ventral bend (arrowed) in the trachea just cranial to the carina. (b) Left ventricular enlargement in isolation. The LV elevates the entire trachea when it is enlarged and there is loss of the normal ventral bend cranial to the carina. (c) Left atrial enlargement in isolation. The LA creates a triangular or wedge-shaped soft tissue opacity at the caudal border of the cardiac silhouette and pushes the left caudal mainstem bronchus (shown in dark blue) dorsally. (d) The effect of a cranial mediastinal mass is shown for comparison. A cranial mediastinal mass (shown in pink) can elevate the trachea cranial to the carina anywhere along its length. Depending on the size and location of the mass, this may be focal elevation or more commonly elevation of the entire pre-cardiac trachea. The cardiac size will be normal. (e) Right atrial enlargement or right atrial mass in isolation. It is very rare to see severe focal right atrial enlargement. An enlarged RA can focally elevate the trachea cranial to the carina. (Note that a heart base mass can also elevate the trachea in this position but usually has a different appearance on the DV/VD view; see Cardiac neoplasia.)</p>

<p>The carina should be located at the fourth or fifth intercostal space. The round radiolucent ring-like structures extending out from the trachea are cross-sectional views of either the left or the right cranial mainstem bronchus (see Chapters 10 and 11). On a VD/DV view the angle between the left and right mainstem bronchi is around 60 degrees at the bifurcation. The mainstem bronchi should create an upsidedown V shape on this view (Figure 7.19).</p>

<title>Pericardial fat stripe</title>
<p>It can be difficult to assess cardiac size when a pleural effusion is present. Fat present between the fibrous pericardium and the pericardial mediastinal pleura may remain visible on the lateral view in animals with pleural effusion. This is known as the <italic>pericardial fat stripe</italic> and may aid radiographic assessment of the heart in animals with pleural fluid (Figure 7.20).</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Aorta</title>
<p>The aorta is divided into three sections:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The ascending aorta: short and arises from the cranial aspect of the heart. Has the same orientation as the LV</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The aortic arch (or transverse arch): short and curves caudally. Gives rise to the brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The descending aorta: long and can be divided into thoracic and abdominal portions.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The aortic isthmus is the junction of the ascending aorta and the aortic arch. The ascending aorta contributes to the cranial heart base area and cannot be seen clearly due to superimposition (see Figure 7.3). The aortic arch and descending aorta are identified on both lateral and DV/VD views. (Figure 7.21). In the normal animal the left border of the descending aorta is identified on the VD/DV view.</p>
<fig>
<label>7.21</label>

<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
</fig>
<p>The aortic diameter is similar to the height of adjacent vertebral bodies; aortic size does not alter in association with hypovolaemia or volume overload (unlike the CdVC).</p>
<p>A focal bulge in the aorta (sometimes also referred to as an elongated, redundant or tortuous aorta) at the aortic isthmus may be seen in a proportion of older cats (Figure 7.22). One study found that this was present in 28&#x0025; of older (&#x003E;10 years) cats. The change does not appear to be associated with systemic hypertension or hyperthyroidism.</p>

</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Caudal vena cava</title>
<p>The CdVC receives blood from the abdomen, pelvis and hindlimbs. The final abdominal tributaries are the hepatic veins. The CdVC enters the thorax by crossing the diaphragm on the right side within the plica vena cava. It then traverses between the accessory and right caudal lung lobes to enter the RA dorsal to the inlet of the coronary sinus. It lies in close association with the right phrenic nerve.</p>
<p>The majority of the intrathoracic CdVC is easily seen on radiographs (Figure 7.23). On the lateral view the CdVC crosses the caudal half of the right ventricular border and can often be seen overlapping the cardiac silhouette for a short distance. On VD/DV views it is seen to the right of the median plane between the caudal right border of the heart and the diaphragm.</p>
<fig>
<label>7.23</label>
<caption><title>Close-ups of (a) lateral and (b) DV radiographs of a dog showing the normal size and location of the CdVC (green lines in (a); arrows in (b)).</title></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="fig_.png" mime-subtype="png"/>
</fig>
<p>The diameter of the CdVC is highly variable due to variations in intrathoracic pressure during respiration and stage in the cardiac cycle. It may also vary in pathological conditions such as right-sided heart disease, hypovolaemia or CdVC obstructive conditions (caval syndrome, masses, etc.; see Acquired vascular diseases). Enlargement of the CdVC is more likely to suggest right-sided heart disease in the dog when:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>CdVC:Ao &#x003E;1.5 (strongly suggestive of right-sided heart abnormality)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CdVC:VL &#x003E;1.3</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CdVC:R4 &#x003E;3.5.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Where Ao = aorta; CdVC = the greatest diameter of the CdVC not overlapping the heart or diaphragm; R4 = diameter of the right fourth thoracic rib just ventral to the spine; and VL = the length of the thoracic vertebra over the tracheal bifurcation. A word of caution: there was shown to be considerable overlap in the CdVC:Ao ratio between normal patients and those with right-sided heart disease.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cranial vena cava</title>
<p>The cranial vena cava (CrVC) receives blood from the head, neck, thoracic wall and forelimbs. The axillary veins (from the forelimbs), together with the internal and external jugular veins, converge to form the right and left brachiocephalic veins. These then unite to create the CrVC. It travels in the cranial mediastinum and receives the costocervical and internal thoracic veins, as well as the azygos vein just cranial to the RA; it finally empties into the RA.</p>
<p>The CrVC is not seen as an individual structure on a radiograph unless a pneumomediastinum is present. It forms the ventral border of the cranial mediastinum on the lateral view.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Azygos vein</title>
<p>The azygos vein forms from the first lumbar veins and passes through the aortic hiatus into the thorax. It then receives intercostal, subcostal, oesophageal and broncho-oesophageal veins and terminates in the CrVC. It is not seen on a radiograph unless a severe pneumomediastinum is present or it is markedly enlarged. It then appears as a wavy vessel immediately ventral to the thoracic spine, receiving tributaries from every intervertebral space (Figure 7.24). It may rarely be seen in very deep-chested, narrow breeds, such as the Greyhound, in the absence of a pneumomediastinum.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Thoracic duct</title>
<p>The thoracic duct originates between the diaphragmatic crura. It has a variable course within the thorax but usually courses cranially along the right dorsal border of the aorta. Its termination is variable but it usually enters the CrVC or left jugular vein.</p>
<p>The thoracic duct is not seen on radiographs. It can be identified using radiographic or CT lymphangiography or on heavily T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Main pulmonary artery</title>
<p>The main pulmonary artery arises from the pulmonic valve and arches dorsally and caudally. It splits into right and left pulmonary arteries immediately caudal to the level of the aortic root. These then form further branches within the left and right lung. The ligamentum arteriosum (the ductus arteriosus in fetal life) joins the proximal part of the left pulmonary artery.</p>
<p>The main pulmonary artery is usually not seen on a lateral radiograph as it is superimposed on the cardiac silhouette. On occasion it may be identified as a round soft tissue opacity located immediately ventral to the carina, and should not be confused with a nodule in this location (see Figure 7.38b). The left and right branches may be radiographically identified on the lateral view. The left branch runs slightly more cranial and also dorsal to the right branch. On VD/DV views the main pulmonary artery contributes to the cranial left cardiac silhouette (Figure 7.25). It appears more prominent during systole and also on a VD view compared with a DV view. This should not be interpreted as pathology. The left and right main branches are initially superimposed on the heart, but further along their course the caudal lobar right and left pulmonary arteries are seen as tubular soft tissue structures coursing caudolaterally in association with the lateral aspects of the caudal mainstem bronchi.</p>

Normally, the artery and vein of each pair is approximately the same size.</p>

<title>Interpretive principles</title>
<p>Thoracic radiographs are extremely useful in the evaluation of the patient with cardiovascular disease. However, it should be noted that radiography and echocardiography are complementary techniques and it is important to understand the limitations and benefits of these two imaging modalities in the assessment of cardiac disease.</p>
<p>In simple terms, echocardiography is far more accurate in identifying chamber enlargement and other structural abnormalities than radiographs. Echocardiography also provides vital functional information that cannot be obtained radiographically. However, radiographs remain indispensable in the evaluation of pulmonary vascular and parenchymal changes secondary to heart disease. For example, a radiograph will quickly reveal evidence of pulmonary venous congestion and/or cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in left-sided failure, or pleural effusion in right-sided failure. Thoracic radiographs are also extremely valuable in monitoring the progress of therapy in heart failure.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 and the Appendices provide further information on echocardiographic technique and normal echocardiographic measurements.</p>
<p>This section covers the radiographic features of specific cardiac chamber and major vessel enlargement. The evaluation of congestive heart failure is also covered here. It is important to have a good knowledge of cardiac anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology when approaching a thoracic radiograph for the evaluation of cardiac disease. It should be remembered that when radiographic changes are present they do not show the disease itself, but rather the haemodynamic consequences of the condition.</p>

<title>Cardiac chamber enlargement</title>
<p>The limitations of radiographs for the evaluation of specific cardiac chamber size have already been discussed. Often more than one chamber will be enlarged and this will complicate interpretation of changes in the cardiac silhouette. It should be emphasized that artefactual chamber and major vessel enlargement will be seen on poorly positioned radiographs and that the utmost care should be taken in obtaining perfectly straight views.</p>
<p>In the following section the DV view is described rather than the VD view, as the former is more commonly obtained in cardiac patients.</p>
<boxed-text>
<caption><title>Concentric and eccentric hypertrophy: what is the difference?</title></caption>
<p>Ventricular hypertrophy may occur in response to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Increased systolic pressure (a pressure overload) leading to <italic>concentric</italic> hypertrophy: the ventricular wall gets thicker and the lumen size remains normal (or reduced)</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>&#x2013;</label><p>Increased diastolic pressure and volume (a volume overload) leading to <italic>eccentric</italic> hypertrophy (also known as <italic>dilatation</italic>): the ventricular wall remains a normal size and the lumen size increases.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The different types of hypertrophy have implications for radiographic interpretation. Concentric hypertrophy can be extremely difficult to recognize on a radiograph, whereas eccentric hypertrophy is more easily seen. Note that in contrast to the ventricles, only <italic>atria</italic> usually show <italic>dilatation</italic><bold> </bold>in cardiac disease.</p>
</boxed-text>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Right atrium</title>

<title>Right ventricle</title>
<p>Right ventricular enlargement is commonly overdiagnosed on thoracic radiographs. This is partly because the shallow-chested conformation of many dog breeds can mimic certain features of right-sided cardiomegaly (such as increased sternal contact). Great care must be taken to differentiate breed variation from true right-sided cardiac enlargement. When truly present, right ventricular enlargement is often accompanied by left-sided changes and right atrial enlargement, and may be hard to identify as a single entity (Figure 7.31).</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Lateral view:</title>
<p>To evaluate the size of the RV, a line can be drawn from the carina to the cardiac apex; approximately two-thirds of the cardiac silhouette should lie cranial to this line and one-third caudal to it. An increased cranial component (e.g. four-fifths cranial and one-fifth caudal to the line) suggests right-sided enlargement. Rotation of the cardiac apex caudodorsally away from the sternum (i.e. pointing more towards the liver than the sternum) is a sensitive sign of right ventricular enlargement but is not always present. Right ventricular (or atrial) enlargement may displace the trachea dorsally over the heart base and cranial to the carina, but the trachea will still maintain its normal terminal ventral bend (unlike in left ventricular enlargement).</p>

<title>Generalized cardiomegaly</title>
<p>The entire cardiac silhouette may appear enlarged in many diseases and this is called generalized cardiomegaly. It is difficult (and usually inaccurate) to detect mild generalized cardiomegaly unless previous radiographs are available from the same patient. A moderate to severe generalized cardiomegaly is seen as an increase in width and height on the lateral view, and width and length on the DV view (Figure 7.34). The heart may also appear more generally rounded than usual. Care should be taken to try and distinguish generalized cardiomegaly from pericardial effusion (see below).</p>

<title>Heart failure</title>
<p>Heart failure can be defined in many ways. One definition is that heart failure is the end result of severe heart disease and is a clinical syndrome, resulting in systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction severe enough to overwhelm the cardiovascular system&#x2019;s compensatory mechanisms. Congestion, oedema, poor peripheral perfusion and/or systemic hypertension result. Radiographic examination provides an invaluable insight into the presence and severity of heart failure.</p>

<p>(a) Lateral radiograph of the same dog as in Figure 7.33 whose marked left atrial and ventricular enlargement is now accompanied by left-sided heart failure. An increase in opacity is evident in the perihilar and caudodorsal regions, due to the presence of cardiogenic alveolar oedema. The CdVC is also wide, due to accompanying right-sided heart disease. (b) DV view. An alveolar infiltrate is present in both left and right caudal lobes. The right caudal lobe is often an early location for oedema in left heart failure. A pleural line is seen between the right middle and caudal lobes (arrowed) and represents a small amount of pleural effusion also present in this patient.</p>
</fig>
<p>Note that severe left-sided heart disease <italic>must also be present</italic> to make the diagnosis of left-sided heart failure. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema may mimic the radiographic appearance (see Chapter 12). One complicating situation is that of an acute onset of heart failure, such as secondary to ruptured chordae tendinae. In this situation substantial left-sided cardiomegaly may not be present. Echocardiographic examination will provide an accurate diagnosis.</p>

<title>Congenital cardiovascular diseases</title>
<p>Congenital cardiovascular diseases are anomalies of the heart and great vessels that have been present since birth. This definition applies even if the condition is not identified until later in life. A wide variety of congenital diseases exists and it is beyond the scope of this manual to explore all of these conditions. Figure 7.44 lists the congenital abnormalities that have been reported in the dog and cat.</p>
<table-7.44/>
<p>In this section, the radiographic, angiocardiographic, echocardiographic and scintigraphic features are described for the main congenital cardiac conditions in the dog and cat. It should be noted that in most cases of congenital cardiac disease, only echocardiography (with Doppler evaluation) and radiographs are required as part of the work-up.</p>
<p>It should be noted that cats tend to get more complex combinations of congenital abnormalities than dogs and careful, skilled echocardiographic assessment is vital in this species.</p>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Patent ductus arteriosus</title>
<p>PDA is the most common congenital cardiac disease in dogs. Small-breed dogs (including, but not limited to, Chihuahua, Maltese, Poodle, Pomeranian, Bichon Fris&#x00E9;, Shetland Sheepdog) and German Shepherd Dogs are predisposed. Bitches are more affected than dogs. Cats are also affected but the condition is less common than in dogs.</p>
<p>The ductus arteriosus is an important part of normal fetal circulation. It extends from the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta and in the fetus functions to divert blood away from the lungs back into the systemic circulation. After birth, pulmonary vascular resistance falls and flow in the ductus reverses. The ductus then closes by constriction of smooth muscle within its wall, brought about by increased arterial oxygen tension that inhibits local prostaglandin release. The ductus is usually closed by 7&#x2013;10 days after birth. It remains in the adult as the ligamentum arteriosum.</p>
<p>PDA results from failure of normal closure of the ductus arteriosus, resulting in a shunting vessel between the descending aorta and the main pulmonary artery.</p>
<p>There are three main types of PDA:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The mildest form of the condition results in closure of the ductus at the pulmonary arterial end only. This produces a clinically insignificant blind-ended pouch called a &#x2018;ductus diverticulum&#x2019;. <italic>No shunting</italic> of blood occurs and this anomaly may only be identified as an incidental finding on postmortem</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The commonest clinically presenting patent ductus is a complete tapering funnel-shaped tube with blood shunting from <italic>left-to-right</italic>. Volume overloading of the <italic>left side</italic> of the heart causes left atrial dilatation and left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The third and least common form for the ductus to take is a non-tapering cylindrical tunnel. This is associated with persistent postnatal pulmonary hypertension and <italic>bidirectional</italic> or <italic>right-to-left shunting</italic> (Eisenmenger&#x2019;s syndrome). These are sometimes known as &#x2018;reversed PDAs&#x2019; and are discussed further, below. The condition results in decreased pulmonary blood flow, a normal to small LV and right ventricular concentric hypertrophy.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Left-to-right shunting</title>
<p>Clinically, a left-to-right shunting PDA is characterized by a continuous machinery-type heart murmur (continuous systolo-diastolic murmur) heard best over the main pulmonary artery. A bounding or &#x2018;waterhammer&#x2019; arterial pulse may also be present.</p>
<p>Most animals are usually asymptomatic when the murmur is discovered. Surgical ligation is recommended in almost all cases.</p>

<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Angiocardiography:</title>
<p>This is usually unnecessary, but should be performed if echocardiography is inconclusive or additional congenital complications are suspected. It is performed by selective catheterization of the aorta, via either a carotid or a femoral approach: contrast medium is injected when the tip of the catheter is just distal to the aortic valve.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>With left-to-right shunting, contrast medium is seen both in the aorta and the main pulmonary artery and its branches immediately after injection.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Often the ductus itself is not identified on angiocardiograms, due to partial superimposition of the aorta and main pulmonary artery. Dilatation of the aorta at the usual location of the shunt is a hint that the left-to-right shunting is due to a PDA.</p></list-item>

<title>Echocardiography:</title>
<p>Ultrasonography is useful both for confirmation of diagnosis and to evaluate the consequences of the PDA on cardiac function. The ductus itself can be seen from either the right parasternal (RPS) short-axis or left parasternal (LPS) cranial window (Figure 7.48). In some cases the ductus is not seen on transthoracic echocardiograms but will be visualized with transoesophageal echocardiography.</p>
<p>Very early in the disease, no changes in chamber size or cardiac function are identified. Later on, the following can be observed:

<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Doppler studies:</title>
<p>If the ductus is visualized, then high-velocity turbulent flow from the aorta, through the ductus and into the main pulmonary artery can be observed (Figure 7.49). Otherwise diagnosis is based on other characteristic Doppler findings:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Main pulmonary artery: continuous high-velocity ductal flow towards the pulmonic valve (up to 4.5&#x2013;5 m/s) (Figure 7.50)</p></list-item>

<title>Right-to-left shunting</title>
<p>Occasionally, <italic>right-to-left</italic> shunting occurs through a PDA due to high pulmonary vascular resistance. This is thought to occur because the non-tapering tubular shape of the ductus in these animals permits aortic pressures to be transmitted to the pulmonary arterial system. The resulting extremely increased pulmonary perfusion eventually leads to intimal arteriolar damage and muscular proliferation, causing marked pulmonary hypertension and reversed flow through the ductus arteriosus (Eisenmenger&#x2019;s syndrome). This change has usually been shown to occur in the first few weeks of life. The pulmonary vascular changes are poorly understood, but are known to be irreversible, thereby precluding surgical treatment for this condition.</p>
<p>The anomaly is quite different in presentation to a left-to-right shunting PDA. Clinical signs include fatigue, shortness of breath and weakness. No murmur or only a soft systolic murmur is heard on auscultation and a split second heart sound may be detected. Differential cyanosis may be seen with normal pink cranial mucous membranes but cyanotic caudal mucous membranes, due to the fact that the PDA originates distal to the brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery. The animal may be polycythaemic.</p>

<title>Pulmonic stenosis</title>
<p>Pulmonic stenosis encompasses any obstruction of blood flow from the RV to the main pulmonary artery. The prevalence is higher in English Bulldogs, but also Beagles, Boxers, Chihuahuas, Schnauzers and all terriers. Pulmonic stenosis is a rare condition in cats. The condition usually occurs in isolation but on occasion other cardiac anomalies, such as tricuspid dysplasia, ASD, patent foramen ovale or VSD, may be present.</p>
<p>The stenosis may occur at different levels:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Valvular</italic> stenosis (most common form): a variety of anomalies may occur including hypoplasia of the valve, thickened valve leaflets, asymmetric valve leaflets and incomplete commissural separation. A fibrous ring may also be present below the valve</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Subvalvular</italic> stenosis (less common): a specific form of this occurs in English Bulldogs and Boxers due to an anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery (Figure 7.55). Many variations are possible, but most commonly the left and right coronary arteries branch from a single large coronary artery that arises from the right aortic sinus of Valsalva and wraps around the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). These cases cannot be treated with balloon valvuloplasty</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Supravalvular</italic> stenosis (rare): may be seen more often in Giant Schnauzers.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The stenosis leads to a pressure overload and concentric hypertrophy of the RV. This in turn leads to decreased right ventricular diastolic compliance, ventricular filling impairment and increased right atrial pressure. Tricuspid regurgitation may result and further raises right atrial pressure with eventual right-sided heart failure.</p>
<fig>
<label>7.55</label>
<caption><title>Normal coronary artery distribution in dogs and humans, and common patterns of single right coronary artery in the latter.</title></caption>

<p>In the type R1 pattern, the right coronary artery (RCA) continues as a single vessel and crosses the caudal crux of the atrioventricular sulcus (open arrow), then continues as the left circumflex (LCx) and left caudal descending (LCD) arteries. In type 2 patterns, the single vessel branches shortly after leaving the aorta. Sub-classifications are made depending on whether the crossing vessel (solid arrow) passes cranial to the pulmonary trunk (PT) (R2A), between the aorta and pulmonary trunk (R2B) or caudal to the aorta (R2C).

<p>The condition is usually asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. However, it eventually leads to exercise intolerance, syncope and possible right-sided heart failure if functional tricuspid insufficiency is present. On clinical examination pulmonic stenosis is characterized by a left-sided systolic heart murmur, most audible at the heart base (ejection type of murmur).</p>
<p>Therapy for the condition includes both medical and surgical options and the appropriate choice depends on the severity of the stenosis and the clinical status of the patient. The condition should be monitored over time as some dogs can gradually develop more severe obstructions.</p>

<title>Aortic stenosis</title>
<p>The vast majority of aortic stenosis occurs in the <italic>subvalvular</italic> region (subvalvular aortic stenosis). This is the most common congenital cardiac malformation in large-breed dogs. <italic>Valvular</italic> stenosis (thickened valves and hypoplastic annulus) is rare, but Bull Terriers are predisposed. A bicuspid valve may also rarely cause a mild valvular stenosis. <italic>Supravalvular</italic> stenosis is also very rare. The remainder of this section relates to subvalvular aortic stenosis.</p>
<p>Large-breed dogs are more commonly affected by subvalvular aortic stenosis. Breed predisposition includes Golden Retrievers, Newfoundlands, German Shepherd Dogs, Boxers, Rottweilers and English Bull Terriers. It occurs occasionally in cats. The condition may be accompanied by other congenital cardiac disorders, such as mitral valve dysplasia and PDA.</p>
<p>The lesion is usually a fixed ridge or ring of fibrous tissue in the LVOT just below the aortic valve. The outflow obstruction leads to increased left ventricular systolic pressure, and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy results. A post-stenotic dilatation of the aorta and sometimes brachiocephalic trunk occurs. Mild aortic regurgitation is often present. Animals with subvalvular aortic stenosis are predisposed to aortic endocarditis, abnormal coronary arterial flow and myocardial infarctions.</p>
<p>The functional and clinical consequences vary with the severity of the obstruction. This ranges from minor obstructions with minimal hypertrophy and no clinical signs, to significant obstructions with concentric hypertrophy of the LV, left-sided heart failure, syncope or sudden death.</p>

<p>These are important in diagnosis and are characterized by high-velocity turbulent aortic flow (see Figure 7.67). The maximum normal aortic velocity in most dogs is 1.7 m/s. However, higher velocities can be seen in normal dogs and also breeds with slightly reduced LVOT size (e.g. Boxers, Golden Retrievers, Bull Terriers).

<title>Ventricular septal defect</title>
<p>VSD is a common congenital disorder in both dogs and cats. Breed predispositions include English Springer Spaniels, West Highland White Terriers and Lakeland Terriers, amongst others. VSD is known to have a genetic basis in the Keeshond with malformations of the conotruncal septum.</p>
<p>Anomalous development of any part of the ventricular septal components may lead to a VSD (see above). However, most commonly the defect occurs at the point of fusion of the membranous and muscular parts of the septum, resulting in a perimembranous lesion. Thus, the defect is most often located &#x2018;high&#x2019; or dorsally on the septum. Occasionally, the defect occurs lower down in the muscular part of the septum.</p>
<p>On the <italic>left</italic> side the defect is usually located in the subaortic septum, just below the aortic valve and typically between the right coronary and non-coronary cusps. On the <italic>right</italic> side the location is more variable. Typically, the VSD opens under the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve (also known as infracristal or under the crista supraventricularis). Less commonly, the opening on the right is in a more cranial location and opens directly into the RVOT above the tricuspid valve (also known as supracristal or above the crista supraventricularis). The full classification of VSDs is complex and is beyond the scope of this manual.</p>
<p>The septal defect allows<italic> left-to-right</italic> shunting of blood unless other significant abnormalities are present, which result in shunt reversal (such as pulmonic stenosis, tricuspid dysplasia or severe pulmonary arterial hypertension). Pathophysiological and clinical effects of the VSD depend upon the size and location of the defect, and the presence or absence of associated malformations. VSDs may be classed as resistive or non-resistive:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Resistive</italic> VSDs are small and provide resistance to flow between the right and left sides</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Non-resistive</italic> VSDs are large (approximately the same size as the aortic orifice), and there is no resistance to flow between the two sides.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The most common type of VSD in the dog is a <italic>small resistive</italic> VSD. However, these are often large enough to have clinical significance. With resistive lesions the flow across the defect depends both on its size and the pressure difference between the left and right sides. Blood is shunted from the high pressure left side to the right side across the defect (in the absence of other abnormalities).</p>
<p>In most cases it has been shown that the shunted volume moves directly into the RVOT, hence right-sided enlargement is not usually a feature of the condition. The shunted blood then enters the pulmonary circulation and finally returns to the left side of the heart. This results in <italic>overcirculation of the pulmonary system and left-sided heart enlargement</italic> (eccentric hypertrophy) if the shunt is significant. If left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increases sufficiently as a result, then left-sided heart failure will ensue.</p>
<p>Less commonly, the defect is lower in the septum and a significant volume of shunted blood enters the RV, rather than exiting immediately via the outflow tract. In this case, right-sided heart enlargement may occur.</p>
<p>Non-resistive VSDs result in the two ventricles functioning as a single chamber. The volume of blood that is shunted, and the direction that it is shunted in, depends purely on the difference between the systemic and pulmonary resistance. In most cases the systemic resistance is much higher and a huge left-to-right shunt occurs. However, this large shunt to the pulmonary circulation will result in increased pulmonary pressure. The RV hypertrophies concentrically in response to this. Both ventricles also hypertrophy eccentrically.</p>
<p>If pulmonary hypertension worsens (pulmonary vascular pathology, reactive pulmonary hypertension) then there will be increased resistance to the right ventricular outflow. The shunt fraction from left-to-right will decrease and eventually shunt reversal may occur should right ventricular systolic pressures exceed left ventricular systolic pressures. The latter is known as <italic>Eisenmenger&#x2019;s complex</italic>;<italic></italic> and right-to-left shunting and cyanosis are observed.</p>
<p>The clinical presentation, prognosis and recommended treatment vary enormously with the type of VSD. In general, small, uncomplicated VSDs have a good prognosis and clinical signs may not be seen. Animals with larger shunts and cardiomegaly have a poorer prognosis. Those with Eisenmenger&#x2019;s complex have a very guarded long-term prognosis.</p>

<p>Colour Doppler investigation is extremely useful to identify VSDs (see Figures 7.70b and 7.71). Shunting through the defect can be demonstrated using Doppler studies, revealing high-velocity and turbulent systolic flow through the defect; the direction of shunting can also be assessed.</p>
<p>The usual velocity of the flow through an uncomplicated small resistive defect (the most common type in dogs) with normal left and right ventricular pressures is &#x2265;4.5 m/s.

<title>Atrial septal defect</title>
<p>ASDs are uncommon congenital abnormalities in the dog. Breeds at risk include the Samoyed, Boxer, Newfoundland and Old English Sheepdog. They are also infrequently seen in cats (mostly endocardial cushion defects).</p>
<p>ASDs can occur at three main locations:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>High in the atrial septum, near the entrance of the pulmonary veins. These are <italic>sinus venosus</italic> ASDs and are very rare</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the middle of the septum. These are <italic>ostium secundum</italic> ASDs and are the most common type. They vary in size. Some authors consider a patent foramen ovale to be a small ostium secundum defect. Conversely, other authors do not consider a patent foramen ovale to be a true ASD, as the atrial septum forms normally but the foramen walls are pushed apart, usually by conditions that increase right atrial pressure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the base of the septum. These are either <italic>ostium primum</italic> defects or <italic>endocardial cushion</italic> defects. Various types of endocardial cushion defects exist and they are often accompanied by abnormal atrioventricular valve development. These defects are usually big and are more commonly reported in cats. A complete endocardial cushion defect comprises a large ASD in the lower atrial septum, a high VSD and fusion of the septal leaflets of the two atrioventricular valves. This results in a communication between all four cardiac chambers and is also known as an <italic>atrioventricular valve canal defect</italic>.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Most ASDs are associated with left-to-right shunting, unless there is a reason for reversal of the flow, with increased right atrial pressure (pulmonic or tricuspid valve malformation or pulmonary hypertension). Just as with VSDs, the defect may be classed as resistive or non-resistive.</p>
<p>The shunting occurs during diastole. Large defects result in significant left-to-right shunting and eccentric hypertrophy of the RV, pulmonary overcirculation and sometimes right atrial dilatation. Right-sided heart failure may result.</p>
<p>If left atrial enlargement is identified then the examiner should look for an additional defect, such as an endocardial cushion defect with mitral regurgitation. These animals may develop left-sided or bilateral heart failure.</p>
<p>Shunt reversal may occur in certain conditions, such as pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension (Eisenmenger&#x2019;s syndrome/physiology).</p>
<p>Most ASDs are not clinically significant and treatment is usually not necessary.</p>

<title>Mitral valve dysplasia</title>
<p>This condition is frequently encountered in dogs, especially Great Danes, English Bull Terriers, German Shepherd Dogs, Mastiffs, Golden Retrievers and Newfoundlands. Cats are also affected and mitral dysplasia may be the most common congenital cardiac defect in this species.</p>
<p>The disease encompasses any combination of malformed valve leaflet or cusps, abnormal chordae tendinae (short, absent or too long) and abnormal papillary muscles (fused, abnormally positioned). Concurrent cardiac abnormalities may be noted in dogs, such as subvalvular aortic stenosis. Most commonly the abnormality is associated with systolic mitral regurgitation. Valvular insufficiency leads to volume overloading, and atrial and ventricular dilatation. Left-sided congestive heart failure may eventually result. Mitral stenosis can also occur and in dogs is seen in the Bull Terrier.</p>
<p>Animals may be asymptomatic or can present with exercise intolerance or even left-sided heart failure. A holosystolic murmur will be heard over the left apex (or left sternal border in cats). The prognosis is variable and influenced by the presence of heart failure.</p>

<p>Ebstein&#x2019;s anomaly is a rare form of tricuspid valve dysplasia. In this condition the base of the cusps of the abnormal tricuspid valve are displaced distally into the ventricle and part of the RV is therefore &#x2018;atrialized&#x2019;.</p>

<title>Tetralogy of Fallot</title>
<p>Tetralogy of Fallot is a complex congenital disorder, resulting from a failure of the conotruncal septum to align properly at the embryonic stage. The Keeshond and English Bulldog are predisposed and the condition is also seen in cats. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cause of <italic>cyanotic</italic> cardiac disease in young animals.</p>
<p>The disease is characterized by four features:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pulmonic stenosis leading to right ventricular outflow obstruction (main pulmonary artery atresia may also be present)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Secondary right ventricular hypertrophy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A subaortic VSD</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dextroposition of the aorta (rightward positioning or overriding aorta).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The right ventricular outflow obstruction and increased right ventricular pressure lead to shunting of blood from the right side to the left via the septal defect. Deoxygenated blood mixes with left-sided oxygenated blood and hypoxaemia results. The LA and LV are small and the pulmonary arteries and veins are underperfused. The bronchial arteries increase the systemic collateral circulation that they provide to the lungs.</p>
<p>Animals present with exercise intolerance, failure to grow, shortness of breath, syncope, cyanosis and secondary polycythaemia. Note that since shunting occurs at the level of the ventricles the cyanosis is generalized and not differential as in reverse PDA. Medical and surgical treatment options exist and the prognosis is variable.</p>

<title>Cor triatriatum sinister and dexter</title>
<p>Cor triatriatum is a rare congenital defect that manifests as a partitioned RA (cor triatriatum dexter, CTD) or even less commonly, a partitioned LA (cor triatriatum sinister, CTS):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>CTD is caused by failure of the right sinus venosus valve to regress during embryogenesis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CTS is caused by an abnormal connection of the LA with the pulmonary veins.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The condition is rare but well documented in dogs. It is extremely rare in cats.</p>
<p>In both CTD and CTS, there is a membrane dividing the atrium into two compartments, resulting in abnormal venous return to the affected atrium (CdVC in the case of CTD and pulmonary veins in the case of CTS). The degree of venous pressure elevation depends on the degree to which the dividing membrane is perforated. If the degree of obstruction is significant then subsequent cardiac failure will occur. This will be left-sided failure in CTS and right-sided failure in CTD. In the latter there may only be congestion of the caudal half of the body (i.e. ascites and hepatomegaly, but no jugular distension) and in this way the condition may mimic a Budd&#x2013;Chiari-like syndrome (see later).</p>
<p>Note that supravalvular mitral stenosis (SMS) closely resembles CTS. The only difference is the level of the obstructing membrane. In SMS the obstruction is distal to the foramen ovale and LAu enlargement will occur; in CTS the obstruction is proximal to the foramen ovale and the LAu is therefore downstream and does not enlarge.</p>

<title>Aortic coarctation</title>
<p>Aortic coarctation is a very rare condition in dogs and even more rare in cats. The disease consists of a narrowing of the aortic lumen that usually occurs at the aortic isthmus, the segment of the aorta between the origin of the left subclavian artery and the insertion of the ductus arteriosus.</p>
<p>It is believed to be due to spreading of the specialized contractile ductal tissue into the aorta to form a sling around it, which after birth becomes part of an obstructive curtain of tissue. The narrowing is responsible for obstruction to the flow into the descending aorta and aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta distal to the obstruction. The narrowing process takes weeks to develop, which leaves time for the LV to adjust to the increased pressure load and for collateral circulation to develop; this is why there are often no clinical signs associated with the disease.</p>

<p>If dogs are screened for presymptomatic DCM, various echocardiographic abnormalities may be identified, such as impaired systolic function prior to unequivocal evidence of LV dilatation. Other cases may have LV enlargement with apparently preserved systolic function. The systolic time interval, PEP:ET ratio, appears to offer the best discrimination between normal and affected dogs. Serial evaluation is required to confirm that these echocardiographic findings precede the development of DCM, and a scoring system has been proposed to monitor these cases.</p>

<title>Boxer cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</title>
<p>Boxer dogs with cardiomyopathy may present with the classical findings of DCM, as described above. Until recently, this was the most common presentation in UK and European Boxers (see Figures 7.96 and 7.97). In contrast, North American Boxers are reported to present with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, of right ventricular origin, with minimal changes initially on echocardiography, although systolic dysfunction and LV dilatation can occur later in the course of the disease. This form is now being increasingly recognized in the UK and Europe. In some affected Boxers, the RV may appear dilated (Figure 7.100) with dysplastic RV apical papillary muscles (Figure 7.100c). However, in many Boxers there may be no echocardiographic evidence of structural abnormalities, despite severe ventricular arrhythmias.</p>

<p>A diagnosis was made of HOCM. There is marked concentric hypertrophy of the LV, evident from (a) the RPS long-axis four-chamber view, (b) the five-chamber view and (c) the short-axis view. There is no evidence of gross abnormality of the aortic valves, LVOT or the ascending aorta on the five-chamber view (b). However, in (b) the mitral valve anterior leaflet in this early systolic frame is shown moving towards the basal septum (*) (where endocardial thickening may be consistent with a &#x2018;kissing&#x2019; lesion). (d) The presence of systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (arrowed) is confirmed by the superior temporal resolution of M-mode at mitral valve level. SAM results in dynamic LVOT obstruction. (e) This can be documented from a left apical view. There is increased aortic outflow velocity with a biphasic acceleration slope (*). In this example, CW Doppler shows aortic peak velocities to be &#x003E;6 m/s. (f) SAM also results in mitral valve incompetence and colour flow Doppler typically shows an eccentric MR jet, coursing towards the posterior-lateral wall of the LA. Ao = Aorta; IVS = Interventricular septum; LA = Left atrium; LV = Left ventricle; LVFW = Left ventricular free wall.</p>

<title>Feline myocardial disease</title>
<p>Cats as a species display the plethora of primary myocardial diseases, classified by the World Health Organization. Imaging, particularly Doppler echocardiography, plays a vital role in determining the definitive diagnosis. Ancillary diagnostic techniques are required to exclude conditions which may secondarily affect the myocardium (blood pressure measurement, clinical pathology, etc.).</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</title>
<p>HCM is the most common form of myocardial disease affecting cats. It is genetically transmitted as an acquired, autosomal dominant trait (proven in Maine Coons). It is characterized by concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, which may be regional or asymmetrical. The wall thickness:LV chamber diameter ratio (= relative wall thickness) is greatly increased. Evidence of diastolic dysfunction is documented by Doppler studies. This is manifested by progressive left atrial enlargement.</p>
<p>Symptomatic cats present with signs of left-sided congestive heart failure (dyspnoea due to pulmonary oedema). This is often of sudden onset, and may be preceded by a stressful incident or fluid loading. There is a long presymptomatic phase. Affected cats may fortuitously have a heart murmur detected, which leads to an early diagnosis. Other cats may be detected by echocardiographic screening schemes in breeds, such as Maine Coons and Persians.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>This is indicated to identify the haemodynamic consequences of heart disease, with evidence of increased left-sided filling pressures:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Left atrial enlargement</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pulmonary venous distension</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pulmonary infiltrate, which may affect any region of the lung field, and be patchy, interstitial, alveolar or mixed. This is consistent with pulmonary oedema (Figure 7.102).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Radiography does not differentiate between the various myocardial diseases. In asymptomatic HCM, there may be no gross radiographic evidence of cardiomegaly or specific chamber enlargement. In symptomatic HCM, left atrial enlargement is evident. Radiographically, apparent biatrial enlargement may be documented, but in most cases, echocardiography shows that the marked left atrial enlargement pushes the interatrial septum and the right atrial wall more to the right and cranially, giving this impression on the cardiac silhouette. The apparent biatrial enlargement gives the classical &#x2018;valentine&#x2019; shaped heart on the DV view (Figure 7.102b). A pleural effusion may be present, associated with biventricular failure.</p>

<title>Restrictive cardiomyopathy</title>
<p>RCM is much more poorly understood than other forms of cardiomyopathy in the cat. It is characterized by relatively normal wall thickness, LV chamber size and systolic function, but marked left atrial enlargement is apparent.

<p>Pulmonary hypertension is a consequence of primary respiratory disease or abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature. Mild degrees of pulmonary hypertension are recognized in brachycephalic breeds of dogs and in obesity (Pickwickian syndrome).</p>
<p>Severe pulmonary parenchymal disease, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in West Highland White Terriers, can result in more significant pulmonary hypertension, although the cardiac manifestations are not usually clinically relevant to the presentation. Pulmonary vascular disease may be secondary to parasitism, such as <italic>Dirofilaria immitis</italic> or <italic>Angiostrongylus vasorum</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Pulmonary vascular disease may be a consequence of an initially left-to-right shunting congenital heart disease, leading to Eisenmenger&#x2019;s physiology (e.g. reverse-shunting PDA or VSD). It is the pulmonary hypertension which results in reversal of the shunting from the pulmonary into the systemic circulation, for those phases of the cardiac cycle where pulmonary pressures exceed systemic pressures, resulting in cyanosis.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the cause of the pulmonary vascular disease is unknown (essential or primary pulmonary hypertension).</p>

<p>(a) RPS long-axis four-chamber view shows marked right atrial and right ventricular dilatation, with concentric hypertrophy of the RV wall. The IVS is flattened, which is also appreciated on (b) the RPS short-axis view. The right branch of the pulmonary artery (RPA) is also markedly dilated as it courses around the base of the heart. (c) The RPS cranial view shows the dilated pulmonary trunk with marked pulmonary insufficiency. (d) The left apical four-chamber view shows tricuspid regurgitation by colour flow Doppler. (e) Mean CW Doppler recorded velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet is 4.6 m/s. By the modified Bernoulli equation, there is a systolic PG (4v<sup>2</sup>) between the RV and RA of 84 mmHg. Therefore, pulmonary arterial systolic pressure is at least 90 mmHg (since normal right atrial pressure is about 6 mmHg). (f) The mean velocity of pulmonary regurgitation is 3.4 m/s (recorded from a RPS cranial view). Therefore, the diastolic PG between the main pulmonary artery and RV is 46 mmHg. Thus, the systolic/diastolic pulmonary pressures are estimated to be at least 90/46 mmHg (but this is an underestimate as the dog is in right-sided failure; RA and RV filling pressures will be increased). This has an impact on the PDA flow. There is some left-to-right diastolic flow but in systole, no flow was evident (&#x2018;balanced&#x2019; PDA as a consequence of the pulmonary hypertension).

<title>Acquired valvular disease</title>
<p>A list of the differential diagnoses of acquired valvular regurgitation is presented in Figure 7.127.</p>
<table-7.127/>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Myxomatous atrioventricular valvular degeneration</title>
<p>Myxomatous atrioventricular valvular degeneration (also known as endocardiosis, chronic degenerative valvular disease) is the most common acquired cardiac disease in small-breed dogs. Commonly affected breeds include the Papillon, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Poodle and Chihuahua. Myxomatous atrioventricular valvular degeneration is uncommon in dogs under the age of 5 years old. The condition is also seen in large-breed dogs and is rarely seen in cats. The aetiology is unknown but the condition is likely to be hereditary in small dog breeds.</p>
<p>The condition may affect either the mitral or the tricuspid valve. Each of these valves consists of two large leaflets (one mural and one septal) and sometimes smaller commissural cusps between the leaflets. Tough fibrous cords called chordae tendinae attach the components of the valve to the papillary muscles. The leaflets have chordae tendinae from both papillary muscles attached to them, the commissural cusps have chordae tendinae from only one papillary muscle.</p>
<p>The pathological changes in myxomatous atrioventricular valvular degeneration can involve the leaflets and the chordae tendinae. The valve leaflets become thickened (most marked at the free edge) and redundant. The thickening may extend to nodular change. The chordae tendinae may also become thickened where they attach to the valve. Eventually they may rupture and result in flail of the valve leaflet.</p>
<p>The clinical presentation of the disease varies from a soft heart murmur to end-stage heart disease and failure. Large dogs may be less tolerant and have a more drastic progression of the condition.</p>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>There is marked variation in radiographic features, depending on the progression of the disease (Figure 7.128). The major features include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Left atrial enlargement (one of earliest and most consistent signs)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Left ventricular enlargement</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Right atrial and ventricular enlargement, depending on the degree of tricuspid involvement.</p></list-item>

<title>Echocardiography</title>
<p>Echocardiography is useful to confirm the diagnosis and assess systolic function.

It is important to examine the entire valve as the lesions may be unevenly spread.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Infective endocarditis</title>
<p>Infective endocarditis involves bacterial infection and inflammation of the cardiac valves in almost all cases, though strictly speaking the term refers to any infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. Transient or persistant bacteraemia is the most common aetiology. The condition is seen mainly in medium to large pure-breed dogs and rarely in cats. German Shepherd Dogs may be over-represented. The mitral valve and aortic valve are the most commonly affected in both species.</p>
<p>Bacteria colonize the valve and create vegetative lesions or destroy the valve, both of which lead to valvular regurgitation. Less commonly the valve may narrow and become stenotic. Organisms reported in canine endocarditis include <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, haemolytic and non-haemolytic streptococci and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Rarer isolates include <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>,<italic> Pseudomonas</italic>,<italic> Erysipelothrix</italic> and infection with the proteobacteria <italic>Bartonella vinsonii.</italic></p>
<p>Clinical presentation of the condition varies. Clinical signs include lethargy, pyrexia, weakness, anorexia, gastrointestinal disease and lameness. A heart murmur is usually, but not always, present. A recent onset of a murmur, pyrexia and the presence of lameness should increase the index of suspicion for infective endocarditis. Blood cultures are used to confirm the diagnosis of bacteraemia, but are not always sensitive.</p>

<title>Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade</title>
<p>Pericardial effusion is the most common pericardial disease seen in small animals. Fluid can accumulate in the pericardial sac due to a variety of disorders that can be systemic, cardiac or pericardial in origin. All generally produce the same end result of cardiac tamponade and congestive heart failure.</p>
<p><italic>Cardiac tamponade</italic> can be defined as compression of the heart due to collection of blood or fluid in the pericardial sac.</p>
<p>The effusion can be classed as a pure transudate, modified transudate, exudate or haemorrhagic (just as in other areas of the body). Chronic effusions can reach large volumes before clinical signs occur as the pericardium is able to slowly enlarge. More acute pericardial effusions (such as those which occur with left atrial rupture) can produce severe tamponade at small volumes (florid tamponade) and even result in death.</p>
<p>Pericardial effusion may be seen in any dog or cat but older large-breed dogs are predisposed. Clinical signs include lethargy, respiratory distress, anorexia, collapse and abdominal distension. Evidence of right-sided heart failure is usually identified on clinical examination. Heart sounds are muffled on auscultation, pulses are weak and pulsus paradoxus may be present.</p>

The latter is more common in dogs.</p>
<p>The condition can develop secondary to chronic idiopathic effusion, mycotic pericarditis, chronic septic pericarditis, foreign body reactions, traumatic pericardial haemorrhage and intrapericardial neoplasia.

<p>Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH) is the most common congenital pericardial anomaly in both dogs and cats. This condition is extensively covered in Chapter 14 in the section on diaphragmatic hernias and so will not be discussed here.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pericardial cysts</title>
<p>Pericardial cysts are rare in dogs and cats. There have been reports of unilocular or multilocular pericardial cyst-like masses in young dogs. These have most often been found to represent organized haematomas. Cysts may also be composed of encapsulated adipose tissue from the omentum or falciform ligament when examined histologically. In many cases the cyst is connected to a fatty pedicle, which enters the diaphragm through a small PPDH. Incarceration of hepatic cysts within the pericardium have been reported in a cat with PPDH.</p>
<p>True endothelium-/epithelium- or mesothelium-lined cysts occur in humans but are extremely rare in the dog and have not been reported in the cat.</p>
<p>Clinical signs of pericardial cysts include abdominal distension, dyspnoea and anorexia. Most cases have concomitant pericardial effusion (see above).</p>

<title>Pericardial defects</title>
<p>Pericardial defects are rare in dogs. Defects may be as extensive as a congenital absence of the pericardial sac (extremely rare) or may be smaller partial defects in varying locations. The aetiology is unknown; congenital, inflammatory, traumatic and necrotic causes have all been considered. Defects ventral to the level of the phrenic nerve are thought unlikely to be congenital. Parts of the heart may herniate through the defect, including part or all of an atrium or myocardial tissue (Figure 7.144). If myocardial tissue becomes incarcerated then ischaemia, necrosis and shock can develop without specific clinical signs. Pericardial defects are most often incidental postmortem diagnoses.</p>

<title>Pneumopericardium</title>
<p>This is a very rare condition that has been diagnosed secondary to trauma and in association with pneumothorax. It can also be seen in combination with bronchial or pulmonary parenchymal tears and pneumomediastinum. Theoretically, an infection with a gas-producing organism may produce a pneumopericardium.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Air must be seen surrounding the entire heart and outline the atria and the intrapericardial parts of the aorta and main pulmonary artery in order to diagnose a pneumopericardium (Figure 7.146). Pneumothorax with air surrounding the pericardium may look like pneumopericardium and is much more common. A horizontal beam (decubitus) view centred on the heart may help to differentiate between air in the pericardial sac and pneumothorax.</p>

<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>CT may be used to confirm the diagnosis, but is probably unnecessary. It may be useful when trying to identify the primary cause.</p>

<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cardiac neoplasia</title>
<p>Cardiac neoplasia is rare in the dog and is seen even less in the cat. The types of neoplasia seen vary between the two species (Figure 7.147). The most common type of cardiac neoplasia in dogs is haemangiosarcoma and in cats is lymphoma. Clinical signs vary with the type of tumour, location and presence of a pericardial effusion. Cardiac neoplasia generally has a poor prognosis.</p>
<p>Radiographs are insensitive for the detection of cardiac neoplasia. Intrapericardial masses need to reach a substantial size before they produce any radiographic size and shape changes in the cardiac silhouette. Ultrasonography is much more valuable in evaluating the presence of cardiac masses but, as described in the section on pericardial diseases, small masses may be missed, particularly in the absence of pericardial effusion. An extremely careful examination is required from both LPS and RPS windows and in long and short axis. Every attempt should be made to visualize the entire RA and the tip of the auricular appendage. CT is also extremely useful, particularly in the evaluation of heart base masses.</p>

<title>Right atrial or auricular neoplasia</title>
<p>The most common right atrial neoplasm is haemangiosarcoma. This may be primary or metastatic and older German Shepherd Dogs and Golden Retrievers are predisposed. Canine haemangiosarcoma has usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis, and the lungs, spleen and liver in particular should be examined for evidence of metastatic disease. Animals usually present with a haemorrhagic non-clotting pericardial effusion (see Pericardial diseases).</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Heart base neoplasia</title>
<p>Heart base masses are usually chemodectomas, but ectopic thyroid and parathyroid tumours may be found less commonly in this location. Chemodectomas (also known as non-chromaffin paragangliomas, members of the APUDoma (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation)) group of neoplasms) are tumours of the aortic bodies. These are congregations of neuroendocrine cells responsible for detecting blood pressure changes. Brachycephalic breeds are predisposed to chemodectomas and this is thought to have an association with chronic hypoxia.</p>
<p>Occasionally, chemodectomas are seen in other locations, such as the cranial mediastinum. In the heart, they wrap around the aortic root and main pulmonary artery. They are locally invasive and expansile. Metastasis is seen in dogs and cats but is not common (occurs in approximately 10&#x2013;20&#x0025; dogs) and is slow to occur. Metastatic sites include the lung, LA, pericardium, liver and kidney.</p>

<title>Acquired vascular diseases</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Dirofilariasis</title>
<p>Heartworm disease, caused by the nematode <italic>Dirofilaria immitis,</italic> affects both dogs and cats in endemic regions. The parasite has a worldwide distribution, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions but with an increasing prevalence in temperate regions, particularly where there is a high urban (and pet) density and appropriate mosquito vectors. The life cycle of the parasite is similar in dogs and cats, but the parasite takes longer to reach patency in cats. Cats are also inherently more resistant to infection.</p>
<p>Adult heartworms live in the pulmonary arteries and in severe infections may also be present in the RV. Microfilariae produced by the adult female heartworm are released into the circulation. These are then ingested by feeding female mosquitos in which they undergo several moults to form an infective stage transmitted by the mosquito into another canine or feline host. About 3 months later the parasite reaches an immature adult stage and enters the vascular system. It then migrates to the heart and lungs where it matures into the adult worm. The pulmonary arterial response to heartworms in the cat is more severe than that in the dog, and in general the clinical manifestations of the disease tend to be more severe in this species.</p>
<p>The manifestations of heartworm disease depend on the number of worms, the chronicity of infection and on interactions between the parasite and host. Most dogs with heartworm infection are asymptomatic. Presenting signs in symptomatic dogs may include lethargy, coughing, poor condition, ascites and syncope. More serious consequences of heartworm disease, such as parasitic eosinophilic pneumonitis, may occur. Rare complications include eosinophilic granulomatosis, thromboembolic disease, pulmonary hypertension, glomerulonephritis, caval syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).</p>
<p>Clinical signs in cats are often chronic and non-specific. These include anorexia, weight loss, vomiting, dyspnoea and coughing.</p>
<p>More acute signs are usually due to aberrant worm migration (more common in cats than dogs) or worm embolization, and include shock, salivation, haemoptysis, neurological signs, vomiting, syncope and even death.</p>

<title>Angiostrongylosis</title>
<p><italic>Angiostrongylus vasorum</italic> is a metastrongylid nematode that infects domestic dogs. <italic>A. vasorum</italic> has a worldwide distribution and within Europe is endemic in southern England, France, Ireland and Denmark. Foxes are presumed to act as a wildlife reservoir for the parasite. The adult worm is oviparous and lives in the right side of the heart or the pulmonary arteries, from where the eggs are carried to the pulmonary capillaries. The eggs hatch and first-stage (L1) larvae migrate through the alveolar epithelium, are coughed up, swallowed and passed in the faeces. The life cycle is indirect and larvae undergo subsequent moults within a molluscan intermediate host, to become third-stage (L3) larvae. When a dog ingests an intermediate host, infective L3 larvae are liberated into the dog&#x2019;s small intestine. The L3 larvae undergo two further moults in the mesenteric lymph nodes and the L5 larvae migrate via the liver to the right side of the heart, completing the life cycle.</p>
<p>The most common clinical signs associated with angiostrongylosis are coughing and dyspnoea caused by the inflammatory response to the eggs and migrating larvae at the level of the alveolar membrane. The second common manifestation of angiostrongylosis is a coagulopathy. Subcutaneous, mucosal and internal haemorrhages may all be seen. Neurological signs associated with cerebral haemorrhage may also occur. Bleeding may occur with or without concurrent respiratory disease and the pathogenesis of the coagulopathy is undetermined. A minority of dogs suffer collapse episodes or sudden death, possibly due to aberrant larval migration into the myocardium. The majority of affected dogs are young and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels appear particularly predisposed to clinical disease.</p>
<p>Angiostrongylosis should be suspected in any young dog presenting with compatible clinical signs and a typical radiographic pattern (see below). The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the presence of L1 larvae in the faeces or airway cytology samples. Other diagnostic findings are variable. Eosinophilic inflammation in airway cytology samples is less common than might be expected. The results of coagulation function testing are inconsistent and in some cases may be normal.</p>

<title>Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension</title>
<p>Idiopathic pulmonary hypertension is a syndrome characterized by increased pulmonary arterial pressure due to hypertrophy of the tunica muscularis and tunica intima with no primary or discernible cause. The condition may be suspected in patients presenting with respiratory and right-sided heart disease in which no underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease can be demonstrated. In advanced disease, cor pulmonale and signs of right-sided heart failure (hepatomegaly, ascites, jugular pulse) may result due to prolonged pressure overload.</p>

<title>Pulmonary thromboembolism</title>
<p>Pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) results in interruption of the blood supply to a portion of the lung due to obstruction of a pulmonary artery(ies) by embolic material (blood clots, parasites, tumour fragments, bacterial aggregates, bone marrow fat, etc.) delivered by the blood stream. Primary thrombosis (formation<italic> in situ</italic>) may result from local stasis, turbulent blood flow or vascular injury. Hypercoagulable states, such as those that exist with glomerulonephritis, Cushing&#x2019;s disease, pancreatitis or DIC, also predispose to thrombus formation in both the pulmonary and systemic circulation.</p>
<p>The consequences of PTE depend on the magnitude of the obstruction and the pre-existing condition; they may range from insignificant to severe ventilation&#x2013;perfusion mismatching, development of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.</p>

<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<p>Pulmonary angiography may delineate abrupt termination or filling defects in large pulmonary arterial segments, or areas of decreased or absent perfusion.

<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>Helical CT angiography is a standard examination for suspected thromboembolism in humans. In dogs it is a useful and efficient technique to detect arterial thrombi in first- and second-order pulmonary arteries. Thrombi in subsegmental vessels may be too small to image reliably. An automatic power injector is required for a post-contrast scan. Multislice CT gives superior results.</p>

<title> Budd&#x2013;Chiari-like syndrome</title>

<title>Coronary artery diseases</title>
<p>The right and left coronary arteries arise from the aortic bulb immediately distal to the aortic valve and supply the muscle of the heart (Figure 7.164). Coronary artery disease is extremely important in humans but rare in dogs and cats. A brief discussion of coronary disease in the dog and cat is given here.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Congenital anomalies</title>
<p>There is variation in the anatomical pattern of the right and left coronary arteries. Five types of coronary arterial patterns have been identified in the dog (see Figure 7.55). Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery can lead to subvalvular pulmonic stenosis in English Bulldogs and Boxers. For surgical or interventional radiological correction of subvalvular pulmonic stenosis, exact knowledge of the anatomical pattern is required.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Angiography:</title>
<p>Selective coronary angiography is required to identify the coronary artery pattern (Figure 7.165).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Coronary arterial and ischaemic heart disease</title>
<p>Ischaemic heart disease is rare in dogs and cats. Myocardial infarction can occur secondary to atherosclerosis or other forms of <italic>arteriosclerosis</italic> in both the dog and cat. <italic>Arteriosclerosis</italic> is arterial wall hardening, loss of elasticity and thickening, leading to luminal narrowing. Specific forms of arteriosclerosis include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Lipid deposition and thickening of the intimal cell layers within arteries (<italic>atherosclerosis</italic>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Calcification of the tunica media of muscular arteries</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Thickening of the walls of small arteries or arterioles due to cell proliferation or hyaline deposition (<italic>arteriolosclerosis</italic>).</p></list-item>
<p>Atherosclerosis has been strongly associated with diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism (but not with hyperadrenocorticism). Mineralization of the walls of the coronary arteries may occur in chronic cases of arteriosclerosis. The gradual occlusion of the coronary arteries leads to myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction and fibrosis. The outcome may be sudden death, acute or chronic heart failure.</p>
<p>Ischaemic heart disease has been postulated as a cause of sudden death during anaesthesia or sedation. Myocardial infarction (generally left ventricular free wall) has also been reported secondary to HCM in the cat. Ischaemic heart disease can also rarely occur as a result of incarceration of the LV in a pericardial defect (congenital) or tear (traumatic) with strangulation of one or both coronary arteries (see Figure 7.144).</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Imaging findings:</title>
<p>Survey radiographs may reveal coronary artery mineralization in dogs (Figure 7.166). It can be difficult radiographically to distinguish coronary mineralization from aortic mineralization without the use of angiography. Coronary angiography is the diagnostic technique of choice, but is seldom used in animals.</p>
<p>With echocardiography, ischaemic myocardium can show thinning, regional hypokinesis or akinesis and reduced or absent contractility.</p>

<title>Radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>The mediastinum is the space between the left and right pleural cavities and encloses all the midline structures of the thorax (Figures 8.1 and 8.2). Its lateral limits are the mediastinal pleurae, which are reflections of the parietal pleurae as they leave the thoracic inlet and diaphragm. The mediastinum is continuous cranially with the fascial planes of the neck via the thoracic inlet and caudally with the retroperitoneal space through the aortic hiatus.</p>
<p>Structures within the mediastinum include the heart and great vessels, trachea, oesophagus, thoracic duct, nerves, lymph nodes and thymus. All mediastinal structures, with the exception of the air-filled trachea and the lumen of the oesophagus, if air-filled, are of soft tissue opacity and so the normal mediastinum appears as a fairly homogenous soft tissue opacity with little contrast between adjacent structures (Figure 8.3). Even if large amounts of fat are deposited in the mediastinum, this is not usually sufficient to outline mediastinal soft tissue organs due to the low-contrast radiographic technique used for the thorax.</p>
<p>The ventral margin of the mediastinum is contiguous with the dorsal surface of the sternum. Radiographically there is often a band of soft tissue opacity dorsal to the sternum, which is a composite shadow of the transverse thoracic muscle, internal thoracic artery and vein, sternal lymph nodes and other structures. Often a large retrosternal fat deposit is located at the level of, and caudal to, the xiphoid process. This often highlights the cardiac apex due to its opacity. The structures of the ventral floor of the mediastinum should not be confused with pleural or mediastinal effusion.</p>
<p>The mediastinum may be considered as being divided into three transverse sections by the heart: cranial, middle (containing the heart) and caudal parts; it is divided into dorsal and ventral parts by a dorsal plane at the level of the carina (see Figure 8.2).</p>
<p>Three major mediastinal reflections are present:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Cranioventral:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Represents the displacement of the cranioventral part of the mediastinum by the right cranial lung lobe (see Figures 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contains the internal thoracic arteries, veins and lymphatics</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ventrodorsal (VD) view (dogs): thin curvilinear opacity on the left of the vertebral column</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lateral view (dogs): curvilinear soft tissue opacity running from the level of the first rib to the sternum.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Caudoventral:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Created by the accessory lobe, extending across the midline and pushing the mediastinum to the left (see Figure 8.2)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Not seen in lateral views</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Seen better on the VD than the dorsoventral (DV) view, but is not consistently visible (Figure 8.5)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Appears as a fine band of soft tissue opacity running between the left side of the diaphragm and the apex of the heart</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Has previously been mistakenly referred to as the cardiophrenic/sternopericardiac ligament. This structure is not radiographically visible (see also Figure 8.16).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Plica venae cavae (see also Figure 8.16):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Surrounds the caudal vena cava (CdVC)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Not visible radiographically as an individual structure.</p></list-item>
<p>As the mediastinum is a difficult area to examine clinically, diagnostic imaging plays an important role in the detection and investigation of mediastinal abnormalities. Survey radiography is the imaging modality of choice for initial screening of the mediastinum, which should be assessed on two orthogonal views of the thorax. The lateral view allows examination of many of the normally visible structures, but does not allow assessment of mediastinal shift (see below). The DV or VD view allows full assessment of the position of the mediastinum and is more sensitive for the presence of mediastinal fluid and for definitive diagnosis of a mediastinal mass. The VD view allows a more complete assessment of the caudal mediastinum than the DV view, as the heart drops away from the diaphragm slightly, increasing the space available for the caudal mediastinum.</p>
<p>Optimal radiographic quality is vital; particular care must be taken to ensure that the thoracic limbs are extended cranially to avoid superimposition of the triceps muscle mass on the cranioventral thorax, mimicking the appearance of a cranioventral mediastinal mass on a lateral view.</p>
<p>According to the body condition of the animal, the mediastinum may contain a variable amount of fat. Obese or brachycephalic breeds have larger fat deposits and this will cause widening of the mediastinum on the DV/VD view (may be greater than twice the width of the vertebral column). This can be difficult to differentiate from a true cranial mediastinal mass (Figure 8.6). Ultrasonography often assists in the differentiation (see below).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiographic visualization of structures</title>
<p>Some mediastinal structures are readily visible on all thoracic radiographs (Figure 8.7). Many of the mediastinal structures are not normally visible, which may be because:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>They are too small to cause sufficient differential attenuation of the primary beam</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The radiographic low-contrast technique for the thorax does not allow mediastinal fat to outline these structures sufficiently</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>They are in contact with other structures of the same opacity and so undergo border effacement.</p></list-item>
<p>Most of these structures, with the exception of the azygos vein, the main pulmonary vessels and the tracheobronchial lymph nodes, lie within the cranial mediastinum and silhouette with one another (border obliteration or effacement). In the normal animal the tracheobronchial lymph nodes and the main pulmonary vessels silhouette with the heart base, and the azygos vein silhouettes with the aorta and ventral longitudinal ligaments of the vertebrae.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Lymph nodes</title>
<p>The cranial sternal (also known as sternal, retrosternal or presternal) lymph nodes are usually paired but some variation exists. These nodes lie just dorsal to the sternum, at the level of the second sternebra. Note that the sternal lymph nodes receive efferent lymphatics from the thoracic wall and abdominal cavity. If these nodes are enlarged then abdominal disease should be considered.</p>
<p>The cranial mediastinal lymph nodes vary in number. These nodes lie in the cranial mediastinum adjacent to the cranial vena cava (CrVC), brachiocephalic trunk, left subclavian artery and trachea.</p>
<p>The bronchial lymph nodes are divided into pulmonary and tracheobronchial groups. The pulmonary nodes are often absent. The middle tracheobronchial lymph node is the largest of the group and forms a V shape lying between the mainstem bronchi at the heart base, caudodorsal to the carina. The apex fits neatly into the angle formed by the tracheal bifurcation (Figure 8.8a). The right and left tracheobronchial lymph nodes lie on the lateral side of their respective bronchus. They sit immediately cranial to the carina, the right just ventral to, and the left just dorsal to the trachea (Figure 8.8a).</p>
<p>Specific radiographic features are seen when these lymph nodes are enlarged (Figure 8.9). Mineralization of the lymph nodes may be seen as a sequel to fungal disease (Figure 8.8b).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Juvenile mediastinum</title>
<p>In the juvenile animal the thymus may be visible due to its relatively large size. In the cat this is best seen on the lateral view as a crescent-shaped opacity, paralleling the cranial border of the heart in the cranioventral thorax (Figure 8.13). In the dog it can be best seen on the DV view as a triangular opacity, extending from the midline towards the left side, the so-called thymic sail (Figure 8.14). It may be occasionally seen cranial to the cardiac silhouette on the lateral view.</p>
<p>The thymus (Figure 8.15) reaches its maximum size at 4 months old, and then progressively undergoes involution until it is no longer visible at about 1 year of age. Occasionally, a thymic remnant may be seen in older animals as a narrow radiopaque line in the position of the previous thymus.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Sussdorf&#x2019;s space</title>
<p>Sussdorf&#x2019;s space refers to a region in the caudal mediastinum in humans, which is mentioned in some canine anatomy and radiology texts as being ventral to the aorta, to the right of the distal oesophagus (Figure 8.16). It derives embryologically from a remnant of the omental bursa becoming trapped within the thorax as the diaphragm develops. In humans it is also known as the cavum mediastini serosum, the persisting pneumatoenteric recess or the infracardiac bursa, and may be a potential space for herniation of abdominal organs.</p>

<title>Interpretive principles</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Mediastinal shift</title>
<p>This term does not usually relate to mediastinal disease but rather gives valuable information on disease processes on either side of the mediastinum. The mediastinum is a mainly midline structure, so displacement or shift to one side or the other, seen on the DV/VD view, is a strong indicator of <italic>change in the volume of one hemithorax</italic>. This is an important radiographic sign to recognize. For example, identification of mediastinal shift can be very important in correct diagnosis and prompt treatment of potentially life-threatening diseases, such as diaphragmatic hernia. Mediastinal shift is recognized by a change in the position of the heart, trachea, aortic arch and CdVC, and by asymmetry between the sizes of the two hemithoraces. It may persist after the active disease process has resolved, as a result of adhesions or lobar collapse.</p>
<p>Mediastinal shift can not be evaluated on a lateral radiograph. However, it must be noted that changes secondary to the shift may be seen on the lateral view. For example, the cardiac silhouette may appear to be elevated from the sternum due to collapse of the underlying lung lobe and mediastinal shift towards that side (see also Figure 13.13, p. 330).</p>
<p>Care must be taken to ensure that the VD or DV radiograph is correctly positioned and free from rotation before assessment is made of the position of the mediastinum, as rotation of the animal will falsely suggest mediastinal shift (Figure 8.17). If the apex of the heart has moved in the <italic>same direction</italic> as the sternum then any apparent mediastinal shift may be an effect of rotation. If the apex of the heart is moved <italic>away</italic> from the sternum, then true mediastinal shift must be present. Where there is doubt, a straight radiograph should be obtained.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of mediastinal shift can help differentiate between pathological and physiological processes; for example, an increase in opacity of the right middle lung lobe with ipsilateral mediastinal shift suggests lobar collapse, whereas an increase in opacity of the right middle lung lobe without mediastinal shift suggests lobar consolidation or a mass.</p>
<p>The direction of the mediastinal shift should be noted. In general:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Unilateral decrease in volume causes shift towards that side (ipsilateral shift) (Figure 8.18a)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unilateral increase in volume causes shift away from that side (contralateral shift) (Figure 8.18b)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Presence of an intrathoracic mass causes shift away from that side (contralateral shift) (Figure 8.18c).</p></list-item>
<p>Causes of mediastinal shift include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Unilateral lung collapse (concomitant signs should be looked for: increased opacity of the lung, cranial displacement of the diaphragm on affected side, etc.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pleural disease with pleural adhesions</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unilateral pleural effusion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unilateral pneumothorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unilateral lobar overinflation due to unilateral pulmonary emphysema or compensatory hyperinflation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Large single or multiple pulmonary masses</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unilateral diaphragmatic hernia/rupture</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Deformities of the thoracic wall or spine, such as scoliosis or pectus excavatum.</p></list-item>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Abnormal visualization of mediastinal structures</title>
<p>It is unusual to see all the mediastinal structures as they are mostly of soft tissue opacity and hence silhouette positively (or border efface) with each other. If usually non-visible mediastinal structures are clearly definable, this must be due to the presence of a contrasting substance between them. There may be increased visibility of the cranial mediastinal structures on a lateral view in extremely obese animals, but on the DV/VD view, little more can be seen due to the thickness of the tissue at this point. The most common clinical situation in which mediastinal structures become visible is when gas highlights the serosal or outer surfaces, indicating pneumomediastinum (see below). A rare but concerning scenario is the presence of an infiltrating metal opacity outlining the serosal surfaces of mediastinal structures, suggesting extravasation of a previously administered contrast medium agent.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Mediastinal masses</title>
<p>It is important to distinguish a true mediastinal mass from a normal anatomical variant. Dogs with a wide shallow thoracic conformation, such as brachycephalic breeds, often have a wide mediastinum (see Figure 8.6). Obese small-breed dogs will have increased fat deposits in the mediastinum, again mimicking a mediastinal mass lesion, often accompanied by clinical signs that further support this diagnosis, such as dyspnoea and exercise intolerance.</p>
<p>Mediastinal masses may be located anywhere within the mediastinum, depending on their aetiology and tissue of origin. Mediastinal masses have been divided into five main locations (Figure 8.19). As with other parts of the body, location may suggest the organ or tissue of origin. For example, a perihilar mass is likely to be due to either enlargement of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes or a mass at the heart base. Often masses can be so large at presentation that their origin is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Assessment of displacement of other intrathoracic structures is useful to determine the origin of such masses. The majority of masses are of soft tissue opacity, thus not permitting further differentiation on the basis of radiological appearance, but occasionally masses may be mineralized (e.g. teratoma) or of fat opacity (e.g. mediastinal lipoma).<italic></italic> Ultrasonography can be very useful in further assessment of these lesions, either using the heart or liver as an acoustic window, or, if the mass is large enough, by a direct transthoracic technique.</p>
<p>Occasionally, it is difficult to decide whether a mass near the midline originates from the mediastinum or from a lung lobe adjacent to the mediastinum. This can be a challenging distinction to make. Factors that may assist in differentiation are shown in Figure 8.20 (see also below and Figure 8.27).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Mediastinal effusion</title>
<p>Mediastinal fluid results in further effacement of the contents of the mediastinum, and generalized mediastinal widening will usually be present. Reverse fissures may occasionally be visible on the DV/VD view. These are seen as smooth triangular soft tissue opacity projections, extending caudolaterally from the midline (Figure 8.21). Fluid may move freely between the pleural and mediastinal spaces if the mediastinal fenestrations remain perforate.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Free fluid <italic>versus</italic> loculated fluid and mass</title>
<p>Loculated fluid, such as may occur with mediastinitis, can result in a focal widening of the mediastinum and can appear similar to a mass lesion. Ultrasonography is very useful in determining the cause of a focal thickening/widening of the mediastinum. Positional radiography may displace free fluid and aid in this distinction (see also Chapter 13).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Alternative imaging of the mediastinum</title>
<p>Due to the limitations of radiographic assessment of the mediastinum it is important to realize the role of alternative imaging techniques in investigation of this region.</p>
<p>Transthoracic ultrasonography of the normal mediastinum is generally unrewarding due to the presence of air-filled lung between the thoracic wall and the mediastinum. However, many structures within the normal mediastinum can be identified using ultrasonography when a pleural effusion is present (see Chapter 13). In animals with mediastinal disease, ultrasonography is very useful in differentiating mediastinal fluid from a mass, and in determining the nature and extent of a mass. Ultrasonography also permits obtaining an ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or tissue biopsy. The cranial mediastinum can be accessed via parasternal, intercostal or thoracic inlet windows, the middle mediastinum via the cardiac notch and the caudal mediastinum either parasternally or via a transhepatic approach. Transoesophageal ultrasonography has been used in the dog to examine the heart base and great vessels, but this technique requires general anaesthesia and expensive equipment and is not widely available (see Chapter 2).</p>
<p>Computed tomography (CT) (Figure 8.22) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are very useful for examining the mediastinum in both dogs and cats. Both allow evaluation of the mediastinum without superimposition from other structures and have better contrast resolution than standard radiography, allowing distinction between solid, fatty, cystic, calcified and vascular structures. CT images of the mediastinum should usually be viewed using a soft tissue window; intravenous contrast medium administration (CT angiography) is particularly helpful in distinguishing mediastinal vessels from masses.</p>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diseases</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pneumomediastinum</title>
<p>Pneumomediastinum is the presence of free gas (usually air) within the mediastinum. It always results from another disease process and the key to investigating and treating the condition lies in identifying the aetiology. When pneumomediastinum occurs alone there are usually no associated clinical signs, and with time the condition spontaneously resolves. However, pneumomediastinum may be accompanied by pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema and/or pneumoretroperitoneum. Clinical signs may then reflect dyspnoea or tachypnoea, secondary to the pneumothorax or discomfort, secondary to the subcutaneous emphysema. Rarely, a large-volume pneumomediastinum may compress the CrVC and CdVC and azygos vein, leading to diminished venous return and circulatory collapse.</p>
<p>An important rule of thumb is that if pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax are present simultaneously, then the pneumomediastinum may have led to the pneumothorax, but that the converse cannot be true. Pneumothorax does not lead to pneumomediastinum as the mediastinum is collapsed by the gas in the pleural space.</p>
<p>There are many possible causes of pneumomediastinum and these are listed in Figure 8.23.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiography is essential in the diagnosis of pneumomediastinum. It allows assessment of the extent of the condition, shows associated lesions and complications, may identify the cause and allows assessment of the resolution or progression of the condition. Radiological appearance is similar in all cases (Figure 8.24):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Increased radiolucency of the mediastinum with dissecting, infiltrating, linear radiolucencies delineating the outer surfaces of different mediastinal structures, greatly increasing visualization of these structures, such as the aorta, oesophagus and cranial mediastinal vessels</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ventral border of <italic>longus colli</italic> muscles can be seen inserting on the ventral border of the sixth thoracic vertebra</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Both the luminal and the serosal surfaces of the trachea can be seen</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Extensive subcutaneous emphysema may also be present, making radiological interpretation more challenging, due to the superimposition of linear and reticulated gas shadows</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Radiographs of the neck or abdomen may demonstrate the causative lesion or extension of free gas into the retroperitoneal space</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pneumoretroperitoneum originating from pneumomediastinum is incidental but should be differentiated from abdominal hollow viscus rupture, which is a surgical emergency (see Figure 8.24c)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Oesophageal perforation will lead to mediastinal fluid accumulation so the presence or absence of this should be carefully assessed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pneumomediastinum can progress to pneumothorax if the volume is large enough (although the converse is not true) and this can hinder diagnosis.</p></list-item>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<p>If oesophageal or tracheal perforation is suspected, administration of 5&#x2013;10 ml of a non-ionic iodinated contrast medium, such as iohexol, may identify the site of perforation. Lateral and DV/VD radiographs should be taken immediately and 5&#x2013;10 minutes after administration to allow time for extravasation of the contrast medium.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Other imaging modalities</title>
<p>Due to the presence of free gas, ultrasonography is not useful. Advanced imaging techniques, such as CT or MRI, are rarely needed to make the diagnosis, although they may assist in identifying the cause (Figures 8.25 and 8.26).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Masses</title>
<p>Mediastinal masses can occur anywhere within the mediastinum, with the most common sites being cranioventral and perihilar. Clinical signs depend on the size and position of the mass. Patients with cranial mediastinal masses usually present with signs of dyspnoea, coughing and exercise intolerance. Occasionally gagging, vomiting or regurgitation may be present secondary either to oesophageal compression or megaoesophagus due to paraneoplastic myasthenia gravis with thymoma.</p>
<p>Horner&#x2019;s syndrome, vocalization changes and laryngeal paralysis may result from peripheral nerve entrapment.</p>
<p>Mediastinal masses may also compress vascular or lymphatic structures. This may lead to head, neck and possibly forelimb swelling if the CrVC is involved, or ascites if the CdVC is involved.</p>
<p>Causes of masses within the mediastinum and their main radiological signs are listed in Figure 8.27.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiological appearance is similar in all cases, but depends on the position and size of the mass (see Figure 8.27):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>When small, the mass may silhouette with other mediastinal tissues and so only be visible as a subtle widening of the appropriate region of the mediastinum</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As the mass enlarges, displacement of nearby or associated structures should become evident. There is commonly border obliteration between a cranial mediastinal mass and the cardiac silhouette, which can make it difficult to assess the heart. However, large masses will push the heart caudally and displace the trachea. Location of the carina caudal to the sixth intercostal space on a lateral view is a sign of cardiac displacement, rather than enlargement (Figure 8.28a)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The DV view is the most useful view to differentiate a mediastinal mass from a mass in the cranial lung lobes (see Figures 8.20 and 8.28ab)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small fat or soft tissue opacity lesions with an eggshell-like mineralization are occasionally seen in the mediastinum of cats. These are foci of nodular fat necrosis and of no clinical significance (Figure 8.28c)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mediastinal and/or pleural fluid are commonly present in association with mediastinal masses, resulting in further border effacement of intrathoracic structures. With large cranial mediastinal masses combined with pleural effusion, the mass and the cardiac silhouette are often completely obliterated by fluid. However, if caudal displacement of the carina is present (caudal to the sixth intercostal space), a diagnosis of cranial mediastinal mass can still be made</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Additional positional views, such as standing lateral or erect DV/VD views, using a horizontal beam may be useful to differentiate a mass from fluid (see also Chapter 13)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The accessory lobe sits in a pleural reflection that can become filled with fluid in pleural effusion. This can make it difficult to differentiate caudal mediastinal masses from loculated pleural fluid or accessory lobe or diaphragmatic masses</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mediastinal haemorrhage can lead to haematoma formation with mass effect. Its margins can be somewhat moulded to the mediastinal border, which helps to distinguish it from other mediastinal masses (Figure 8.28d)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Additional pathology, such as megaoesophagus (may suggest thymoma with paraneoplastic myasthenia gravis) or abdominal lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly (may suggest lymphoma), should be looked for.</p></list-item>
<p>Further imaging techniques, such as contrast studies, ultrasonography and CT, may be required to try to identify the site of the lesion.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Oesophagography may identify involvement or displacement of the oesophagus.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Angiography may be useful to delineate masses or identify vascular invasion, malformation or involvement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Positive-contrast peritoneography may be performed to investigate cases of suspected PPDH or diaphragmatic rupture or hernia.</p></list-item>
<p>These procedures have now been largely superseded by ultrasonography.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>Ultrasonography is invaluable in assessing mediastinal masses, particularly those located in a cranioventral position where a suitable transthoracic acoustic window can be accessed. The caudal mediastinum is harder to image with ultrasonography, but a subcostal, or parasternal, approach may be successful. Assessment can be made of the echogenicity and margination of the mass, and any involvement of the other mediastinal structures. Mediastinal origin of a mass may be confirmed by identifying movement of the right and left lung lobes over the static mass.</p>
<p>Ultrasonography allows guided FNA or biopsy techniques to be performed for cytological diagnosis, and hence appropriate treatment to be instigated. It is essential to obtain a coagulation profile before performing a biopsy. It should be remembered that the mass may represent a large mediastinal blood clot in a coagulopathic animal.</p>
<p>Ultrasonography is also particularly helpful in distinguishing cranial mediastinal fat or fluid from a true mass:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fat has a characteristic hyperechoic and hyperattenuating appearance and usually surrounds but does not displace vessels (Figure 8.29)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Effusion will usually be anechoic (see below)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Masses vary in appearance but are often hypoechoic compared to fat, displace mediastinal vessels, may have central vasculature identified with colour Doppler and may be accompanied by effusion (Figure 8.30).</p></list-item>
<p>It is not possible to confirm definitively the cause or origin of a mediastinal mass using ultrasonography; many masses appear identical on unltrasound scans. Biopsy remains the gold standard; however, certain ultrasonographic features may be useful in narrowing the differential list:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Mediastinal lymph node enlargement and lymphoma:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lymphoma may be represented by a number of enlarged nodes or a focal mass, often thymic in origin</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cranial mediastinal and presternal lymph nodes are usually easily identified as hypoechoic nodular masses surrounding the mediastinal vessels (Figure 8.31). They may occasionally be cystic or heterogenous</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Multicentric lymphoma is also the most common cause of caudal mediastinal mass lesions. This region is harder to interrogate ultrasonographically</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Certain ultrasonographic features may be more suspicious for malignant neoplasia rather than reactive nodal change. These require further investigation in animals but include abnormal size and shape, abnormal (non-hilar) angioarchitecture, altered echogenicity of the hilus and evidence of nodal necrosis. Contrast harmonic ultrasonography shows potential for the evaluation of malignant nodes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>FNA often provides confirmation of the diagnosis, without the need for biopsy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Thymoma:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ultrasonographic appearance may vary, and may look identical to thymic lymphoma (Figure 8.32)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Large thymomas are often echogenic with small to large cystic regions</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small thymomas may mimic abnormal lymph nodes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On occasion, thymomas may invade the CrVC.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Oesophageal lesions: rarely, it is possible to identify an oesophageal mass lesion ultrasonographically (see Chapter 9). This is facilitated by the presence of pleural effusion, and a transhepatic route usually provides the best acoustic window</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mediastinal cyst (see below)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mediastinal haematoma:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Varies greatly in appearance over time since haemorrhage occurred</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A simple haematoma is avascular and usually shows ultrasonographic resolution with time</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The presence of central vasculature within the mass suggests the presence of an underlying haemorrhagic lesion, i.e. the mass is not purely a large haematoma</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Often co-existing effusion is present.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>CT is very useful in the diagnosis and evaluation of mediastinal masses (Figure 8.33). It provides further information on a radiographically identified mass and can also allow identification of a mass not seen or only suspected on standard radiographs. CT potentially allows distinction between tumours, abscesses, cysts and haematomas.</p>
<p>Biopsy remains the gold standard and CT-guided biopsy (Figure 8.34) may be performed in masses that are not amenable to biopsy under ultrasound guidance. CT is also extremely useful to guide surgical intervention or radiation therapy.</p>
<p>Intravenous contrast medium should be administered, unless there is a clinical contraindication. Pre- and post-contrast techniques allow assessment of the margins and vascularity of the lesion and the association between the mass and the vessels within the mediastinum, allowing differentiation between masses that are locally invasive and those which are merely space-occupying.</p>
<p>CT angiography with a rapid injection pump will allow assessment of both arterial supply and venous drainage and facilitate surgical planning.</p>
<p>Tumour staging may be carried out, with assessment of local lymphadenopathy.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Scintigraphy</title>
<p>Scintigraphy using sodium <sup>99m</sup>Tc-pertechnetate or iodine-123 can be used to identify neoplastic ectopic thyroid tissue. Radionuclide uptake in the mass is indicative of thyroidal origin of the tissue (Figure 8.35).</p>
<p>Larger and more intense masses are more likely to be malignant (ectopic thyroid carcinoma or metastatic thyroid carcinoma infiltrating cranial mediastinal lymph nodes). Smaller and less intense masses may also represent hyperfunctioning ectopic thyroid tissue (especially in hyperthyroid animals or animals that have previously undergone thyroidectomy). Evaluation of the scintigram in light of the animal&#x2019;s history and hormonal status is mandatory; a biopsy sample is needed for definitive characterization of benign <italic>versus</italic> malignant disease.</p>
<p>Scintigraphy performed with indium-111 labelled white blood cells may be used to identify occult abscesses.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cysts</title>
<p>A variety of mediastinal cysts may occur in cats and less frequently in dogs. These include cysts of pleural, branchial, thymic, lymphatic, bronchogenic and neoplastic origin. Mediastinal cysts are often benign incidental findings, though compressive effects may be present. It should also be noted that occasionally cyst rupture may lead to chronic mediastinitis.</p>
<p>Idiopathic mediastinal cysts are commonly seen in older cats. These are usually solitary mass lesions in the cranioventral mediastinum and are benign and asymptomatic, unless very large. The contents are usually of low cellularity and aspiration is usually unnecessary.</p>
<p>In dogs, large fluid-filled cystic structures are occasionally identified in the caudal mediastinum. The exact origin of these cysts cannot always be determined, but paraoesophageal abscessation, cystic lung tumours or parasitic cysts should be considered.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Findings are as for other mediastinal masses.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A cranioventral location is most common.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small idiopathic mediastinal cysts in cats may appear as faint, barely visible soft tissue opacities on a lateral view cranial to the heart (Figure 8.36a).</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>Findings are diagnostic for a cystic lesion (see Figure 8.36b):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Thin-walled anechoic structure(s)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complex cysts may have a more echogenic fluid content</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Beware of cysts associated with neoplasia (such as cystic thymoma).</p></list-item>
</sec3>

<list-item><p>Contrast-enhancing rim</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CT-guided aspiration can be performed.</p></list-item>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Effusion</title>
<p>Mediastinal effusion or fluid is uncommon. Effusions include pus, lymph, blood, chyle, transudate and modified transudate.</p>
<p>In chylomediastinum, effusion from the thoracic duct will initially be limited to the mediastinum, but the fluid has usually entered the pleural space by the time the animal shows clinical signs.</p>
<p>Haemomediastinum may result from trauma. This may occur due to bleeding from one of the great vessels (usually rapidly fatal) or the haemorrhage may extend into the mediastinum from trauma to the neck. Other causes of mediastinal haemorrhage include coagulopathy, neoplastic erosion of vessels and, rarely, rapid involution of the thymus (which is usually fatal).</p>
<p>Oesophageal perforation results in mediastinitis, and initially small volumes of fluid may distribute evenly throughout the mediastinum.</p>
<p>Some neoplastic masses may produce a modified transudate.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>A DV view is the most useful:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Reverse fissures are visible at the heart base</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Some widening of both the cranial mediastinum and the caudoventral mediastinal reflection is seen.</p></list-item>
<p>On the lateral view, the apex of the heart and the cranioventral mediastinal reflection may be obscured, but changes may be minimal.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>Ultrasonography has limited use in the presence of small volumes of fluid due to the difficulty in locating a suitable acoustic window. It may be useful to guide sampling techniques. It can be difficult to differentiate pleural and mediastinal fluid just on the basis of ultrasonography. However, this distinction is easier in the cranial thorax where more typical appearances are identified:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fluid in the pleural space of the cranial thorax is visualized as two discrete pockets separated by the narrow mediastinal pleura (Figure 8.37)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cranial mediastinal fluid causes a widened mediastinum and the mediastinal vessels are separated from fat by irregularly shaped fluid pockets.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>CT is much more sensitive for small volumes of mediastinal fluid and also allows identification of pocketed fluid. CT numbers can be measured, which may provide useful additional information about the nature of the fluid, particularly if a sample is unobtainable. Altering the position of the animal (e.g. sternal <italic>versus</italic> dorsal recumbency) and repeating a CT sequence will assist in displacing fluid, allowing better evaluation of co-existing lesions.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Mediastinitis</title>
<p>Mediastinitis implies infection or inflammation in the mediastinum and results in thickening of the mediastinal pleurae and exudate production. It can develop from a primary disease process, such as chronic fungal (<italic>Histoplasma</italic> or <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species) or bacterial (including <italic>Actinomyces</italic> and <italic>Nocardia</italic> species) granulomatous mediastinitis. Spirocercosis has also been associated with mediastinitis (see Chapter 9).</p>
<p>Mediastinitis may also occur secondary to perforation of the trachea or oesophagus, or as an extension of an infectious or inflammatory process from the cervical soft tissue, pericardium, pulmonary parenchyma or pleural space. The most common cause is oesophageal perforation.</p>
<p>Clinical features may include tachypnoea, dyspnoea, pain, cough, regurgitation, voice change (secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement) and head and neck swelling.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Widening and perhaps increase in opacity of the mediastinum may be seen, particularly on the DV/VD view.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the inflammation is focal then discrete thickenings or mass lesions may be seen, which must then be differentiated from neoplastic mediastinal masses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pneumomediastinum may be present if the mediastinitis is secondary to tracheal or oesophageal perforation.</p></list-item>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<p>If oesophageal perforation is suspected then oral administration of a small volume (5&#x2013;10 ml) of non-ionic water-soluble iodine-containing contrast medium, such as iohexol, may identify the site. Both lateral and DV/VD views should be taken to look for evidence of extravasation of the contrast medium. If no extravasation is seen on initial films then repeat films should be taken 5&#x2013;10 minutes later to look for slow leakage.</p>
<p>In cases of chronic oesophageal perforation, the original perforation may have closed and no contrast leakage will be evident.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>The usefulness of ultrasonography depends on the site and extent of the mediastinitis and whether or not any fluid or pleural thickening is loculated or focal. Appearance of mediastinitis includes:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Gross thickening and increased echogenicity of the mediastinal pleurae, and small to moderate amounts of echogenic fluid</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Enlarged lymph nodes and free gas may also be identified.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>As with mediastinal fluid, CT is very sensitive to small volumes of exudate or subtle thickening of the mediastinum. Small volumes of mediastinal gas are easily seen when present. Contrast-enhanced CT images should show areas of inflammation or necrotic areas to allow the extent of the disease to be assessed.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Mediastinal oedema</title>
<p>Mediastinal oedema may accompany any condition that produces oedema elsewhere. It is often overlooked due to the concurrent presence of mediastinal effusion, but may be more readily recognized now that CT and MRI are more commonly used to evaluate the mediastinum.</p>

<title>Radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>The oesophagus is a tubular structure connecting the pharynx to the stomach, and is bound at each end by a sphincter. The cranial sphincter is composed of the paired thyropharyngeal and cricopharyngeal muscles. The caudal sphincter is complex and comprises the following:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Focal thickening of the muscular part of the oesophageal wall</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interdigitating gastric rugal folds</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A sling formed by the deep oblique smooth muscle of the lesser gastric curvature and the right diaphragmatic crus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The acute angle of entrance into the gastro-oesophageal junction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Positive intra-abdominal pressure compressing the intra-abdominal section of the oesophagus.</p></list-item>
<p>The oesophageal wall is composed of four layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis and serosa. The muscularis is a striated muscle in the dog, but in the cat the caudal third is a smooth muscle with the overlying mucosa having characteristic herringbone-like folds.</p>
<p>Thoracic (including the stomach area) and cervical (including the pharyngeal area) radiographs should be obtained in all animals suspected of having oesophageal disease. The oesophagus is located in the dorsal mediastinum, slightly to the left of the midline. It is rarely visible on survey radiographs, although occasionally a portion of it may be visible on the left lateral view as a poorly defined, tubular, faint soft tissue opacity between the heart base and the diaphragm (Figure 9.1).</p>
<p>The oesophagus may become visible in animals with pneumomediastinum. It may also be seen in emaciated animals with a deep, narrow thoracic conformation.</p>
<p>Small amounts of oesophageal air may be recognized in normal animals, secondary to aerophagia, dyspnoea, excitement or sedation. Air tends to accumulate at four sites in the oesophagus:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>As a triangular gas opacity in the most proximal cervical oesophagus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cranial to the first rib</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Between the first rib and the heart, dorsal to or superimposed on the trachea</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Caudal to the heart, between the aorta and the caudal vena cava (CdVC).</p></list-item>
<p>General anaesthesia may cause marked generalized dilation of the normal oesophagus, mimicking megaoesophagus. Further studies may be warranted in animals with clinical signs of oesophageal disease and oesophageal air visible on survey radiographs.</p>
<p>The absence of abnormal oesophageal findings on survey radiographs does not preclude the presence of oesophageal disease. Secondary signs of oesophageal disease should be looked for. These include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pneumomediastinum</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ventral displacement of trachea</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tracheal stripe sign</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mediastinitis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pleural effusion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Aspiration pneumonia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hypertrophic osteopathy.</p></list-item>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interpretive principles</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheal stripe sign</title>
<p>The tracheal stripe sign (Figure 9.2) is also known as the tracheal band or tracheo-oesophageal stripe sign. The draping of the ventral wall of the oesophagus over the dorsal tracheal wall results in border effacement of the two walls. The tracheal stripe sign indicates oesophageal luminal air. Care should be taken not to confuse a tracheal stripe sign with a pneumomediastinum, where mediastinal gas may surround the external surface of the oesophagus (see Chapter 8).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Redundant oesophagus</title>
<p>This is an occasional incidental finding. It is usually identified as a ventral, but occasionally lateral, deviation of the oesophagus in the thoracic inlet area in mainly young brachycephalic breeds, especially English Bulldogs (Figure 9.3) and Shar Peis. It has also been described in the cat.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast radiography</title>
<p>The technique for oesophagography and the choice of contrast media are described in Chapter 1.</p>
<p>The different muscular anatomy of the canine and feline oesophagus creates specific appearances following contrast medium administration. The canine oesophagus has a longitudinal linear pattern on positive contrast studies (Figure 9.4). In the cat the smooth muscle of the terminal third of the oesophagus creates a striated herringbone appearance (Figure 9.5).</p>
<p>It is important to understand normal oesophageal function. Contrast medium usually proceeds rapidly through the oesophagus. Primary peristalsis is generated in the pharynx and carries a bolus aborally to the lower oesophageal sphincter. If primary peristalsis fails to propel the bolus to the stomach, then a secondary peristaltic wave is quickly generated by intraluminal distension and complete transport of the bolus to the stomach occurs. Transit time of the bolus is longer in cats than in the dog.</p>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diseases</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Megaoesophagus</title>
<p>Megaoesophagus is strictly a descriptive term and simply indicates dilatation of parts (segmental) of or the entire (generalized) oesophagus. The condition may be congenital (uncommon) or acquired (common). The greatest challenge is to determine the cause.</p>
<p>A familial predisposition for congenital megaoesophagus has been suggested in the Irish Setter, Great Dane, German Shepherd Dog (Figure 9.6), Labrador Retriever, Chinese Shar Pei, Newfoundland, Miniature Schnauzer and Wirehaired Fox Terrier. Congenital segmental oesophageal dysfunction has been reported in Shar Peis and Newfoundland Retrievers. German Shepherd Dogs, Golden Retrievers and Irish Setters have been reported to have an increased risk for developing acquired megaoesophagus. Congenital megaoesophagus in cats is rare, but Siamese cats may be predisposed.</p>
<p>The underlying cause of acquired megaoesophagus is often unidentified (idiopathic), although it may be secondary to one of many possible causes (Figure 9.7). Early diagnosis and elimination of predisposing diseases are essential for successful management because prolonged dysfunction can cause irreversible distension. Adult-onset idiopathic megaoesophagus is associated with a poor to grave prognosis. The prognosis for cats with megaoesophagus is guarded.</p>
<p>Animals with megaoesophagus usually present with regurgitation or may occasionally be asymptomatic. In congenital cases, signs are usually first noticed after weaning.</p>
<p>It is important to note that many animals without oesophageal disease will appear to have a gas-filled, dilated oesophagus on survey radiographs as a result of aerophagia, sedation, general anaesthesia or oesophageal intubation (accidental or oesophageal stethoscope, endoscopy). Care should be taken not to confuse this incidental finding with a genuine megaoesophagus. Repeat radiographs should be undertaken in the conscious patient, and a contrast study might be indicated if confusion remains.</p>

<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<p>These are required if the oesophagus is not identified on survey radiographs. Contrast medium defines the degree of oesophageal dilatation, the lack of function, the extent of involvement and structural abnormalities and helps evaluate the lower oesophageal sphincter region (Figure 9.9). Barium mixed with food (&#x2018;barium burger&#x2019;) usually provides the best depiction of oesophageal abnormalities. In mild cases the oesophagus is marginally to slightly widened, allowing some pooling of barium (regular tube-like or irregular in outline).</p>
<p>There is a risk of aspiration pneumonia.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Fluoroscopy with contrast medium</title>
<p>This is indicated for early, mild or segmented disease and oesophageal motility evaluation. In early disease, the oesophagus is not dilated but rather has a decreased propulsive ability.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Scintigraphy</title>
<p>This is useful to identify those animals with subtle oesophageal motility abnormalities and consistent clinical signs but with no identifiable abnormality on routine diagnostic imaging. <sup>99m</sup>Technetium sulphur colloid is generally used.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Oesophagitis</title>
<p>Oesophagitis can be caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER), trauma, foreign bodies, ingestion of caustic substances, structural abnormalities (hiatal hernia, neoplasm) and chronic vomiting. It has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for the development of megaoesophagus in dogs. Oral dry administration of tablets (particularly of tetracycline or doxycycline) has been associated with development of oesophagitis in cats.</p>
<p>The presence of GER does not necessarily lead to oesophagitis and may be seen in normal patients. Reflux oesophagitis occurs when acidic gastric content remains within the oesophageal lumen for a prolonged period and fails to be neutralized by bicarbonate. Intra-abdominal surgery (such as ovariohysterectomy), old age and no or prolonged fasting (approaching 24 hours) before anaesthesia are associated with a higher risk of developing reflux oesophagitis.</p>
<p>Once oesophagitis has developed, a vicious cycle can ensue whereby inflammation decreases the tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter, predisposing to GER and further exacerbating inflammation. This may eventually lead to the development of an oesophageal stricture.</p>
<p>The prognosis of patients with uncomplicated oesophagitis tends to be good.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>This is usually normal. Findings may include generalized or focal oesophageal dilatation (air/ingesta/fluid). Underlying causes (such as hernias, neoplasia or foreign bodies) may be identified.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<p>These are usually necessary for diagnosis. Findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Generalized or focal oesophageal dilatation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Thickened oesophageal wall</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Irregularities of oesophageal mucosa, prominent mucosal striation and prolonged retention of contrast material (Figure 9.10)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Signs of ulceration, perforation and stricture formation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changes are often most evident in the terminal oesophagus.</p></list-item>
<p>Contrast studies may sometimes be normal.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Fluoroscopy with contrast medium</title>
<p>This is indicated to rule out oesophageal spasticity, GER and anomalies predisposing to the latter. It is more accurate than static contrast studies in the diagnosis of GER.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Oesophageal stricture</title>
<p>Oesophageal strictures are most commonly intraluminal acquired lesions and may occur secondary to trauma or severe inflammation. Typical scenarios include stricture formation (Figure 9.11) secondary to an oesophageal foreign body or reflux oesophagitis under anaesthesia. Strictures due to congenital or extraluminal disease are rare. Examples include perioesophageal fibrosis due to mediastinitis or external compression due to a perioesophageal mass (Figure 9.12). Degrees of oesophageal strictures (and hence prognosis) vary greatly, ranging from a minor reduction in oesophageal diameter with reduced distensibility, to near total closure of the oesophageal lumen. There may be a gradual progression of clinical signs as the stricture worsens.</p>
<p>Patients with severe oesophagitis at the site of stricture, those with long strictures and those with dense, thick mature accumulations of fibrous connective tissue at the stricture site have a more guarded prognosis.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>This is usually normal. Prestenotic oesophageal dilatation (gas/ingesta) may be seen.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<p>Positive contrast studies (barium burger) are often needed to confirm the diagnosis of stricture. They are useful in assessing the number, location and length of strictures and the diameter of the narrowed segment. Persistent luminal narrowing on sequential radiographs differentiates the stricture from oesophageal spasm. Prestenotic oesophageal dilatation may be evident. Normal longitudinal striations tend to converge and/or become irregular at the site of injury to the mucosa.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Fluoroscopy with contrast medium</title>
<p>This enables optimal evaluation of the length of strictures and maximal diameter of the narrowed segment, and the assessment of motility.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>This modality is useful in diagnosing compressive strictures caused by an extramural mass. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may be performed under ultrasound guidance.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Oesophageal diverticulum</title>
<p>Oesophageal diverticula are rare pouch-like sacculations of the oesophageal wall that may be congenital (Figure 9.13) or acquired. Congenital diverticula occur most often in medium-sized to small-breed dogs. Clinical signs of diverticula are related to the underlying oesophageal disease or to local food stasis and inflammation.</p>
<p>Two types of acquired diverticula may occur:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pulsion diverticula result from conditions of increased intraluminal pressure, secondary to obstruction (stricture or foreign body) or altered motility. The oesophageal wall thins and weakens and bulges out under increased intraluminal pressure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Traction diverticula result from traction on the oesophageal wall, secondary to perioesophageal inflammation, fibrosis and adhesions. These are often small and insignificant.</p></list-item>
<p>The accumulation of ingesta within the diverticulum leads to oesophagitis, mechanical obstruction (seen with large diverticula) and disturbed oesophageal motility. Severe cases with mucosal ulceration may eventually perforate, resulting in mediastinitis.</p>
<p>Diverticula should not be confused with a normal redundant oesophagus. Extending the patient&#x2019;s neck should result in the disappearance of a &#x2018;false diverticulum&#x2019;.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>

<list-item><p>Traction diverticula usually have triangular shape with wide base at the oesophagus, thick wall and tip pointing to the area of adhesion.</p></list-item>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Oesophageal neoplasia</title>
<p>Fibrosarcoma and osteosarcoma developing from malignant transformation of Spirocerca lupi granulomas (see below) are the most common malignant oesophageal neoplasms in dogs. Other oesophageal neoplasms are extremely rare and constitute less than 0.5&#x0025; of all cancers in the dog and cat. These may be of primary oesophageal, perioesophageal (lymph nodes, thyroid, thymus and heart base; see Chapter 8) or metastatic (thyroid, pulmonary and gastric carcinomas) origin.</p>
<p>Primary neoplasms include leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma (Figure 9.14), carcinoma and chondrosarcoma in the dog, with squamous cell carcinoma being the most common in the cat. Leiomyomas show a slow growth rate and lack of invasiveness, and on occasion may only be recognized at necropsy.</p>

<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<p>A positive or negative (pneumo-oesophagram) contrast medium may be employed. An intraluminal mass/filling defect and/or obstruction with contrast medium pooling cranially will be demonstrated.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>This may give additional information. Ultrasonographic access should be attempted via the thoracic inlet, intercostal spaces or transdiaphragmatic route, depending on the radiographic location of the mass. Ultrasound-guided FNA can also be considered.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>This is recommended when surgery is contemplated. It is the most sensitive diagnostic imaging tool for pulmonary metastasis and also allows evaluation of regional lymph nodes.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Oesophageal foreign body</title>
<p>Foreign bodies are common in the dog, particularly in young dogs (up to 2&#x2013;3 years) and terrier breeds. They are unusual in the cat. Retained oesophageal foreign bodies may cause partial or complete mechanical obstruction, accentuated by muscle spasms and tissue oedema around the foreign body. They most commonly lodge at the thoracic inlet, at the base of the heart or at the oesophageal hiatus. Thoracic (including the stomach area) and cervical (including the pharyngeal area) radiographs should be obtained.</p>
<p>Complications, such as aspiration pneumonia or oesophageal perforation (with secondary pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, mediastinitis, pleural effusion, pleuritis, tracheo-oesophageal fistula), and underlying pathology should be ruled out. The longer the foreign body has been lodged, the greater the chance for perforation and the greater the risk of rupture during oesophageal retrieval. Sharp foreign bodies also have an increased risk of perforation.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Findings may include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Radiopaque foreign body (Figure 9.15)</p></list-item>

</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Fluoroscopy</title>
<p>This may be used to guide retrieval of the foreign body. It is an effective method of guiding treatment and complications are uncommon.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Vascular ring anomaly</title>
<p>Vascular ring anomalies are congenital malformations of the major arteries of the heart that entrap the intrathoracic oesophagus and cause oesophageal obstruction (see also Chapter 7). The condition is likely to be heritable in German Shepherd Dogs, Irish Setters and Greyhounds. Vascular ring anomalies are uncommon in the cat. There are several described vascular ring anomalies of which the persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) is by far the most common (95&#x0025; of cases). Other less common vascular anomalies include persistent right or left subclavian arteries, double aortic arch (may cause dyspnoea), persistent right aorta, left aortic arch and right ligamentum arteriosum, and aberrant intercostal arteries. Frequently, additional cardiac or vascular anomalies (such as persistent left cranial vena cava, CrVC) are present but may not be of clinical significance.</p>
<p>Certain clinical signs are similar in all vascular ring anomalies. Most animals present as thin and stunted with a history of regurgitation of solid foods at the time of weaning. Rarely, the ductus arteriosus may remain patent in PRAA (corresponding radiographic signs of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) should be looked for; see Chapter 7) and can be auscultated with its characteristic machinery or continuous murmur. Patients with double aortic arch anomalies may be dyspnoeic due to concomitant entrapment of the trachea.</p>
<p>The prognosis is variable as the oesophageal dilatation and hypomotility are not fully reversible. In general, patients with generalized megaoesophagus or dilatation caudal to the heart have a poor prognosis, and contrast medium administration may be necessary to evaluate this. The earlier the condition is corrected, the better the prognosis.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Oesophageal dilatation or pulsion diverticulum (air/ingesta) cranial to stricture with abrupt tapering at about the fourth intercostal space to the sixth rib (Figure 9.17)</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Moderate or marked focal leftward curvature of the trachea near the cranial border of the heart in DV/VD radiographs is a reliable sign of PRAA in young dogs with consistent clinical signs (Figure 9.18). Oesophagography is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Moderate or marked focal narrowing of the trachea</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If a well defined normal left descending aortic margin is visible on the VD/DV view, one of the less common vascular ring anomalies should be considered</p></list-item>

</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<p>Contrast medium (barium burger) is recommended for complete evaluation prior to surgery and for prognostic purposes.

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Selective angiography</title>
<p>This is occasionally performed for definitive confirmation of the type and location of the vascular anomaly prior to surgery. It should be considered if there is suspicion of an atypical vascular ring anomaly or PDA with PRAA.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>This is advised in cases of PDA. It is also useful to exclude other congenital cardiac abnormalities.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Spirocercosis</title>
<p>The nematode Spirocerca lupi may lead to the development of oesophageal granulomas and neoplasms. The condition is common in endemic areas (most tropical and subtropical countries) but otherwise very rare. Although any breed can be affected, the condition is seen more commonly in large-breed dogs. Infections in cats are seldom reported. Eggs containing first-stage infective larvae are eaten by coprophagous dung beetles. Dogs then ingest the beetle or a paratenic host and the larvae penetrate the gastric wall, migrate through arteries and finally reach the thoracic aorta in about 3 weeks. After 10&#x2013;12 weeks in the aorta the larvae migrate to the oesophagus and it is here that the adult develops within nodules in the oesophageal wall. With time, a granuloma forms and is typically situated in the terminal oesophageal wall. In atypical cases, it may be hilar and smaller. Granulomas may undergo neoplastic transformation to fibrosarcomas/osteosarcomas in 26&#x2013;41&#x0025; of cases. Animals typically present with regurgitation (or less commonly vomiting) or an oesophageal mass may be identified as an incidental finding.</p>
<p>Complications can occur due to perforation of the oesophagus (mediastinitis, pleuritis, mediastinal haematoma, aberrant migration with abscess formation) or rupture of the aortic aneurysm (acute haemothorax). Parotid salivary gland hypertrophy with hypersalivation may also occur.</p>

<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>Computed tomography (CT) is recommended when surgery is contemplated for mass resection. It is the most sensitive tool for detection of thoracic metastasis.

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>This will allow visualization of hypertrophic parotid salivary glands. An attempt can be made to scan the S. lupi granuloma using the liver as an acoustic window, via a diaphragmatic approach (Figure 9.24). Ultrasonography may also be useful to investigate mediastinal complications.</p>

<title>Gastro-oesophageal intussusception</title>
<p>Gastro-oesophageal intussusception is a rare condition and results from invagination of the stomach, with or without other abdominal viscera (spleen, duodenum, pancreas and omentum), into the caudal oesophageal lumen.</p>
<p>Predisposing factors include megaoesophagus, congenital oesophageal abnormalities, incompetency of the lower oesophageal sphincter and chronic vomition. It has been reported to be more common in younger dogs (&#x003C;3 months). The highest prevalence has been reported in German Shepherd Dogs, or large-breed dogs in general.</p>
<p>The clinical signs include regurgitation, vomiting and distress. Rapid deterioration occurs should a large portion of the stomach prolapse into the oesophagus. This constitutes a surgical emergency with mortality rates in excess of 95&#x0025;.</p>

<title>Radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>The trachea is a semi-rigid air-filled tube that connects the larynx with the bronchial system. The trachea ends caudally with a crest, called the <italic>carina</italic>, which divides and channels the airflow into the two mainstem bronchi. In a normal dog and cat the carina should be located at the level of the fourth or fifth intercostal space (Figure 10.1).</p>
<p>The tracheal wall consists of C-shaped cartilages, interconnecting tracheal ligaments and respiratory mucosa. Dorsally the open cartilages are connected by the trachealis muscle and connective tissue.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The tracheal wall is only distinguishable from neighbouring cervical and mediastinal soft tissue if air is present in the oesophagus, giving the &#x2018;tracheal stripe sign&#x2019; (see Chapter 9), or if the tracheal cartilages are mineralized.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In cross section the canine and feline trachea is slightly wider than it is high.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The oesophagus is dorsally adjacent to the cranial cervical trachea and continues along the left dorsolateral aspect of the mid cervical to cranial thoracic trachea, where it courses again to the dorsal aspect of the tracheal bifurcation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The lateral view is most useful for assessment of the trachea, although the dorsoventral (DV) or ventrodorsal (VD) view is useful to assess lateral displacement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Radiographs should be made with the head in a neutral position to avoid artefacts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Separate radiographs should also be taken of the cervical and thoracic tracheal segments as exposure and positioning requirements differ.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contrast studies have been used in the diagnosis of tracheal disease, such as tracheal rupture and tracheal masses. However, tracheobronchoscopy has largely superseded this technique, as the aspiration of contrast media can exacerbate respiratory problems.</p></list-item>

<title>Tracheal location</title>
<p>On a lateral radiograph the course of the trachea is roughly parallel to the cervical spine.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The trachea forms an angle with the thoracic spine that varies with body type (approximate range of 10&#x2013;20 degrees).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The most caudal part of the trachea often narrows in the DV view and angles ventrally before bifurcating into mainstem bronchi on the lateral view.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The trachea is a relatively rigid tube that does not collapse in length and, at least not normally, in diameter.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cervical flexion shortens the distance between the larynx and the carina and therefore results in some tracheal deviation, usually seen at the thoracic inlet (Figure 10.4).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Any space-occupying lesion along the normal tracheal course will also result in deviation rather than collapse of the tracheal lumen. Tracheal deviation should therefore always be assessed in context to avoid misinterpretation.</p></list-item>
<p>In the DV or VD view, the trachea is superimposed on the vertebrae and sternebrae, although it may deviate slightly to the right at the thoracic inlet and in the cranial mediastinum, especially in small barrel-chested breeds and obese animals.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Incidental tracheal narrowing</title>
<p>The lumen of the caudal cervical trachea frequently appears narrowed with a dorsally concave tracheal border in dogs without contributable respiratory signs. This phenomenon is often referred to as &#x2018;pseudocollapse&#x2019; (Figure 10.5). This is a misnomer because:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>This condition is always caused by a true reduction in the tracheal lumen, but probably not marked enough to cause clinical signs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A relatively wide dorsal trachealis muscle allows partial invagination of extratracheal structures into the tracheal lumen (sometimes referred to as &#x2018;redundant tracheal membrane&#x2019;)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rotation of the tracheal cross-sectional plane in relation to the axial plane of the neck exacerbates the radiographic effect</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Extension of the head and neck promotes compression and narrowing of the lumen.</p></list-item>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Dynamic changes with inspiration and expiration</title>
<p>The tracheal luminal diameter should not alter markedly between inspiration and expiration. Dynamic variation in the tracheal lumen is increased by:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Softening of the tracheal rings</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Flaring of the tracheal rings</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obstruction to airflow</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Respiratory effort.</p></list-item>
<p>Pharyngeal, laryngeal and intrathoracic conditions can all influence tracheal dynamics and therefore these areas should also be assessed radiographically. The phase of respiration is important in the diagnosis of tracheal collapse and thus radiographs should be made in both inspiration and expiration, including both the cervical trachea and the thoracic trachea.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Echotracheography</title>
<p>The cervical trachea can be identified ultrasonographically in both sagittal and transverse planes. However, the presence of aerated lung in the thorax impairs the usefulness of intrathoracic tracheal ultrasonography. Ultrasonography has been used to identify tracheal collapse in the cervical region, where the trachea may be seen as a crescent shape during collapse. However, radiography and fluoroscopy remain more sensitive indicators of this condition.</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheal computed tomography</title>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Indications and limitations</title>
<p>Tracheal computed tomography (CT) is a useful technique to investigate:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Collapse</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rupture</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obstruction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mass lesion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Placement of a stent.</p></list-item>
<p>Advantages of tracheal CT compared with other modalities include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Cross-sectional evaluation of the entire tracheal length</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Real-time evaluation during the respiratory cycle.</p></list-item>
<p>The technique is limited by the anaesthetic requirements.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Intubation can either be difficult to achieve or render the study non-diagnostic.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dynamic studies are preferentially performed in conscious animals, which is only possible in very compliant patients.</p></list-item>
<p>A very useful application of tracheal CT is for the follow-up examination of dogs with intraluminal stent treatment for tracheal collapse. This is because it allows differentiation of intraluminal fluid accumulation from excessive granulation tissue, which is otherwise a difficult task (Figure 10.6).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Technique</title>
<p>The animal should be placed in lateral or ventral recumbency, preferably using short-term injection anaesthesia. A helical CT scan of the entire tracheal length should be performed, with a 2&#x2013;3 mm slice width and a pitch of 2.</p>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diseases</title>
<p>Tracheal diseases can be categorized according to morphological and/or dynamic origin, and by intraluminal, mural or extrinsic (external to wall) conditions as listed in Figure 10.7.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheal hypoplasia</title>
<p>Tracheal hypoplasia is a congenital narrowing of the trachea by at least 50&#x0025; of the cross-sectional lumen, affecting the entire length of the trachea. The tracheal rings are almost complete with a negligible dorsal muscle.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>There is an increased incidence of the condition in English Bulldogs and English Mastiffs, but tracheal hypoplasia has also been described in the Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd Dog, Weimaraner and Basset Hound.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The condition is rarely seen in the cat.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tracheal hypoplasia is one component of the canine brachycephalic airway obstruction complex, which includes stenotic nares, elongated soft palate and everted laryngeal saccules.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Concurrent congenital abnormalities, such as megaoesophagus and pulmonic and aortic stenosis, have also been identified.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The condition can be diagnosed at an early age, and affected animals may present with stridor, dyspnoea, reduced exercise tolerance and coughing. Excitement exacerbates the condition, which is often progressive during the day. Recurrent respiratory infections may lead to bronchopneumonia.</p></list-item>
<p>Dogs and cats with mucopolysaccharidosis VII, a rare genetic lysosomal storage disease causing dysfunctional bone and cartilage formation, can have a similar narrowing of the internal tracheal diameter with thickened misshapen tracheal cartilages.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Imaging findings</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Radiographically, the trachea appears uniformly narrowed (Figure 10.8) compared with the variation of luminal size along the length of the trachea seen with tracheal collapse.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wall thickening (Figure 10.9) may be identified, which can be a result of chronic inflammation or genetic malformation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tracheal growth may be retarded in some animals, which later have a period of compensation, thus the diagnosis should be made with caution in young animals.</p></list-item>
<p>The smallest ratio of trachea:thoracic inlet in Bulldogs with no clinical signs of respiratory disease has been established as 0.09 (see Figure 10.2).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheal stenosis</title>
<p>Tracheal stenosis is a rare condition and occurs as a result of bite wounds, prolonged intubation or tracheal surgery, although segmental tracheal stenosis may occur congenitally. It may be asymptomatic, despite a reduction of up to 80&#x0025; in the size of the tracheal lumen in cross section. However, in severe cases, stenosis may result in exertional dyspnoea, wheezing and coughing, with the potential for cyanosis, syncope or asphyxiation.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Imaging findings</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Readily recognizable radiographically as a focal narrowing in the trachea (Figure 10.10).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May be variable in the number of tracheal rings involved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Loss of cartilage tissue results in soft tissue proliferation, which may be seen as an irregular margin of the stenosed region.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CT can be very helpful for determining the exact location and extent of stenosis (Figure 10.11).</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interventional radiology procedures</title>
<p>Intraluminal tracheal stent placement can allow alleviation of airway obstruction. The technique is discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheal collapse</title>
<p>Tracheal collapse is a progressive, degenerative disease of the tracheal cartilage rings, predominantly affecting middle-aged to older small- and toy-breed dogs.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Hypocellularity and decreased glycosaminoglycan and calcium content result in subsequent dynamic tracheal collapse during respiration.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Elongation of the dorsal trachealis muscle and elastic dorsal tracheal membrane, and flaring of the tracheal rings, results in a flattening of the trachea into a crescent shape.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tracheal collapse may be: inspiratory, involving the cervical region; expiratory, involving the intrathoracic region; or mixed, where the entire trachea may be involved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The location and degree of collapse are variable and a mild degree of tracheal collapse is quite commonly seen in older small and toy breeds, often without clinical signs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collapse may extend to the bronchi.</p></list-item>
<p>Clinical signs range from a mild, intermittent &#x2018;honking&#x2019; cough to severe respiratory distress and cyanosis.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Coughing can be elicited by tracheal compression and may be exacerbated by excitement, such as pulling against a collar, or drinking cold water.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tracheal collapse may be associated with tracheobronchitis, laryngeal oedema, emphysema, hepatomegaly, left heart failure and cor pulmonale.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A presumably genetic condition has been observed by one of the authors [TS] in Golden Retrievers from a breeding colony where total tracheal collapse occurred after minimal pulling against the collar.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bronchoscopy is very useful in the diagnosis of tracheal collapse and a scoring system has been developed, which serves as a gold standard (Figure 10.12).</p></list-item>
<p>Cervical tracheal collapse can also occur as a consequence of laryngeal or nasopharyngeal airway obstruction in dogs or cats (laryngeal paralysis, masses, laryngitis, nasopharyngeal polyps).</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Increased inspiratory effort creates sufficient negative intratracheal pressure to collapse the tracheal lumen.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This is particularly typical for cats, where degenerative cartilage ring disorders have only been described in mucopolysaccharidosis.</p></list-item>
<p>It is therefore important to look for an upper respiratory tract obstruction in any cat with tracheal collapse.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Imaging findings</title>
<p>Radiography, fluoroscopy and CT are all used in the diagnosis of clinically significant tracheal collapse.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The lateral view is most useful in demonstrating the tracheal lumen.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>DV radiographs may demonstrate a fusiform widening of the trachea in areas which are narrowed from the lateral view, although superimposition of the spine may reduce visualization of this effect.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The craniocaudal tangential view (Figure 10.13) of the thoracic inlet may be used to demonstrate tracheal collapse, but is difficult to perform. A crescentic appearance of the trachea is seen when tracheal collapse is present.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fluoroscopy is particularly useful to demonstrate dynamic changes in phase with respiration at the cost of reduced image detail.</p></list-item>
<p>Inspiratory and expiratory lateral radiographs should be taken to demonstrate both cervical and intrathoracic collapse. Timing of exposure can be challenging as affected animals often suffer from shallow breathing. Figure 10.14 demonstrates the effect of respiration phase on the radiographic appearance of the collapsing trachea.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>An inspiratory study demonstrates collapse of the cervical segment and dilatation of the thoracic segment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Expiratory views show collapse of the thoracic segment and a normal appearance of the cervical segment (Figure 10.15). In marked expiration or coughing, the tracheal lumen may become completely occluded (Figure 10.16).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ventral wall of the trachea usually remains straight, whilst the dorsal border is blurred or irregular due to uneven flaring of the tracheal rings and/or inflammatory mucosal changes (Figure 10.17).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Radiography of the larynx, pharynx and nose can be helpful to rule out upper airway obstruction as a cause of cervical tracheal collapse, particularly in cats (Figure 10.18).</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interventional radiological procedures</title>
<p>Intraluminal tracheal stent placement is a valid technique in the treatment of tracheal collapse in selected cases (for further information see Chapter 6).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheal laceration and avulsion</title>
<p>Tracheal lacerations or avulsions are rare but serious conditions most commonly associated with trauma, such as road traffic accidents and bite injuries, or following overzealous intubation (most commonly seen in cats).</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Tracheal laceration and avulsion may occur as a result of wound dehiscence following tracheal surgery, e.g. for a tracheal neoplasm, or more rarely following neoplastic tracheal wall invasion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tracheal avulsion has specifically been reported as a rare consequence of neck hyperextension during trauma.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clinical signs include dyspnoea, of variable severity depending on the size of the lesion, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum and possibly pneumothorax. However, clinical signs are often delayed and may be related to subsequent stenosis.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Imaging findings</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The tracheal wall lesion itself may not be directly visible, with secondary features being more readily identifiable (Figure 10.19).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The shape of the trachea may be altered with irregularity of the walls and/or lumen.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A pneumomediastinum is commonly identified and this may be relatively localized or generalized. This pneumomediastinum may occasionally extend to a pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum or pneumoretroperitoneum.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A &#x2018;pseudotrachea&#x2019; may be identified radiographically, seen as a ballooned area of the trachea, where a complete rupture has occurred. Tracheal rings are not present in this section. Local mediastinal structures only focally distend with air, giving the false impression of an intact tracheal wall (Figure 10.20).</p></list-item>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheal masses</title>
<p>Endotracheal masses include neoplasms, granulomas, polyps and haematomas. Local haematomas may also occur with rodenticide toxicity, although diffuse narrowing of the trachea is more common in this condition.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Tracheal masses are rare and often not identifiable if small or surrounded by exudates. They may be focal and polypoid, or sessile and plaque-like.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tracheal granulomas can occur as a result of infection (parasitic, fungal or bacterial) or following tracheotomy. Inflammatory masses include lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and lymphoid hyperplasia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tracheal neoplasia (Figure 10.21) is rare in dogs and cats. Tumours may also invade the trachea extramurally, e.g. thyroid carcinoma, lung neoplasm, aortic body tumour and oesophageal tumour, although this is not a common finding.</p></list-item>
<p>Clinical signs depend on the degree of obstruction. The condition can be asymptomatic until it is quite advanced, as up to half the airway may be compromised without the appearance of clinical signs. However, close examination may reveal a slow inspiratory phase of respiration, followed by a more rapid expiratory phase. Progressively, stridor and rattles, paroxysmal coughing, gagging, dyspnoea and dysphonia may occur.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Imaging findings</title>
<p>Radiography is relatively sensitive but non-specific for the diagnosis of tracheal masses.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The main radiographic finding is a local obstruction of the radiolucent tracheal lumen by a lesion of soft tissue opacity (Figure 10.22).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Underinflation of the lung may be seen with cervical tracheal obstruction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intrathoracic obstruction may result in air trapping, seen as a hyperlucent lung field and caudal displacement of the diaphragm.</p></list-item>
<p>Contrast-enhanced CT allows assessment of the exact location and extent of tracheal masses (Figure 10.23).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interventional tracheal radiology</title>
<p>Intraluminal tracheal stent placement can allow alleviation of airway obstruction caused by tracheal masses that are not readily accessible via surgery, or when surgery is declined, or not indicated. The technique is discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Foreign material in the trachea</title>
<p>The ease with which foreign bodies in the trachea can be seen depends upon the opacity, location, size and view used.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Tracheobronchial secretions and superimposition of skeletal structures may impair visualization of the foreign body.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inhaled foreign bodies are most commonly found in young animals, with larger types, such as teeth and small stones, lodging at the tracheal bifurcation, and smaller foreign bodies, such as grass awns, passing into the bronchi.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The left caudal lobe bronchus is the most common site as this lobe continues in a straight line on from the trachea.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small foreign bodies may be coughed out, unless they are barbed or pointed, or are surrounded by mucus, which may adhere them to the tracheal wall.</p></list-item>
<p>Clinically, animals with tracheal foreign bodies are more likely to present with dyspnoea and respiratory noise, whilst animals with bronchial foreign bodies more commonly produce a cough of sudden onset. The latter are most commonly working dogs. Haemoptysis may be seen. Chronic cases of plant awn inhalation may progress to abscessation, with perforation of the bronchus and the development of pneumonia, pyothorax and infection of distant sites (see Chapter 14). The variable consequences of partial or complete airway obstruction are discussed further in Chapter 11. In cats, the prominent ossified clavicles can be superimposed on the tracheal lumen and should not be confused with a tracheal foreign body.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Imaging findings</title>
<p>At least two radiographic views should be taken to localize tracheal foreign bodies.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Radiopaque foreign bodies, such as stones, bones, teeth and marbles, are easily seen (Figure 10.24a).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Plastic or organic foreign bodies are less visible, although the non-anatomical shape may help in identification.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p> An endotracheal tube that has been bitten through and dislodged during anaesthetic recovery can easily be seen radiographically (Figure 10.24b) and removed endoscopically.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mucus surrounding the foreign body may be seen as a focal increase in soft tissue opacity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fluid in the tracheal lumen is not radiographically visible since it does not create clear margins. However, aspirated barium liquid is frequently seen after oesophagography studies due to its mineral opacity. Small amounts are of no clinical consequence.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interventional radiological procedures</title>
<p>Interventional radiological techniques are useful for retrieval of foreign bodies in the trachea and mainstem bronchi. In small patients where surgical or endoscopic intervention could severely compromise airway patency, interventional radiological techniques are particularly valuable. These techniques are described in Chapter 6.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheitis</title>
<p>This condition may occur as a result of viral, bacterial or parasitic infection, or from non-infectious causes, such as prolonged barking, collapsing trachea or chronic cardiac disease.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Irritation by gas, dust or allergy may result in tracheitis, and severe cases may be associated with bronchitis or bronchopneumonia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Exudate, necrosis and mucosal proliferation, as well as contraction of the trachealis muscle, may result in narrowing of the tracheal wall.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clinically, a dry, sometimes paroxysmal, cough is seen and may be associated with discomfort or rarely dyspnoea. The animal is otherwise healthy in uncomplicated cases of tracheobronchitis.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Imaging findings</title>
<p>Tracheitis is often radiographically unremarkable unless it is severe or complicated by tracheal collapse, cardiac or pulmonary disease. Acute severe tracheobronchitis may result in marked luminal narrowing and may mimic tracheal hypoplasia.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title><italic><bold>Oslerus osleri</italic> infection<italic></bold></italic></title>
<p>This parasitic infection (previously known as <italic>Filaroides osleri</italic>) is relatively rare nowadays and is usually identified in dogs less than 2 years old, in particular in kennelled dogs, such as Greyhounds.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Direct transmission from dog to dog is possible, including from dam to pup through faeces and saliva.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clinical signs include a mild to paroxysmal, hacking and often unproductive cough, which may end in retching, and is unresponsive to antibiotics.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The trachea is sensitive to palpation and, unless a secondary infection is present, a normal body temperature is found.</p></list-item>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tracheal haemorrhage</title>
<p>Tracheal haemorrhage can occur locally secondary to injury from external or internal trauma, particularly during intubation accidents, or more commonly, diffusely as a result of generalized bleeding disorders in dogs and cats. In particular, rodenticide intoxication can lead to diffuse thickening of the tracheal wall with submucosal haemorrhagic infiltrate and is often associated with other sites of haemorrhage, particularly in the mediastinum and lungs.</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Extrinsic conditions affecting tracheal position and opacity</title>
<p>A variety of conditions of neighbouring organs can affect the radiographic position and opacity of the trachea. In most cases these do not result in clinical tracheal disease. Marked extrinsic tracheal compression may become clinically apparent.</p>
</sec3>

<title>Enlarged cardiac silhouette</title>
<p>Cardiac enlargement involving the heart base and marked pericardial effusion can cause dorsal deviation of the thoracic trachea.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Unless the cardiac enlargement is focal, such as with heart base tumours, the entire trachea is typically dorsally deviated without being bent. This feature distinguishes most cardiac diseases from many other conditions that do bend the trachea.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>In pulmonic stenosis, the dilated post-stenotic main pulmonary artery segment can protrude dorsally from the cranial heart base and superimpose on the ventral aspect of the caudal thoracic tracheal lumen.

However, only a minority of dogs with pulmonic stenosis demonstrate a &#x2018;hat sign&#x2019;. This is also an example of how an external soft tissue lesion can create the false impression of luminal narrowing of the thoracic trachea (Figure 10.29, see also Figure 7.56a, p. 116).</p></list-item>

<title>Persistent right aortic arch</title>
<p>A persistent right aortic arch (PRAA) is the most common vascular ring anomaly in dogs, where the aortic arch is formed by the right instead of the left aortic branch. The trachea and oesophagus are trapped between the right-sided aortic arch and left-sided ductus arteriosus.<italic></italic> Deviation and focal compression of the thoracic trachea occur due to entrapment.

<title>Radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>The bronchial tree begins at the termination of the trachea with its division into the right and left principal (or mainstem) bronchi. The principal bronchi are short and each divides into lobar bronchi (also known as secondary bronchi); these supply the various lobes of the lung and are named according to the lobe they supply (Figures 11.1 and 11.2<italic>)</italic>.</p>
<p>The right principal bronchus divides into four lobar bronchi, one for each lobe of the right lung: cranial, middle, caudal and accessory. The left principal bronchus divides into two lobar bronchi: cranial and caudal. The cranial secondary bronchus then divides to supply the cranial and caudal segments of the left cranial lung lobe. The left caudal secondary bronchus supplies the left caudal lung lobe.</p>
<p>Within each lobe the lobar bronchi subdivide further into segmental bronchi (sometimes referred to as tertiary bronchi). The segmental bronchi with the lung tissue they ventilate are called <italic>bronchopulmonary segments</italic>. Each bronchopulmonary segment is independent. Adjacent bronchopulmonary segments normally communicate with each other in the dog through the interalveolar pores of Kohn and channels of Lambert (see also Chapter 12). The segmental bronchi branch into smaller generations of bronchi until the formation of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs and pulmonary alveoli. The number of generations depends on the size of the animal and is difficult to measure.</p>
<p>The bronchial walls are formed by hyaline cartilage rings and spiral bands of smooth muscle. Bronchioles are commonly less than 1 mm in diameter and have no cartilaginous support.</p>
<p>Bronchi and the surrounding tissue, up to the level of the respiratory bronchioles, receive their blood supply from the bronchial artery, which, although variable in origin, is commonly a continuation of the broncho-oesophageal artery. Venous return is via the pulmonary circulation.</p>
<p>On radiographs the bronchi are usually poorly seen unless they have a thickened or calcified wall. Only the larger bronchi in the hilar region can normally be identified on survey radiographs. The location of a bronchus is between the pulmonary artery and the vein with the artery being dorsal (or cranial) in lateral views and lateral in dorsoventral (DV) or ventrodorsal (VD) views. Bronchial arteries are not seen on radiographs. The space between the paired pulmonary artery and vein on a radiograph does not necessarily represent the bronchial lumen. Bronchi should gradually taper towards the periphery.</p>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interpretive principles</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiographic signs of bronchial disease</title>
<p>It is important to note that the severity of the clinical signs in bronchial disease does not always correlate with the radiographic signs. In many dogs with clinical bronchitis the thoracic radiographs may appear normal.</p>
<p>When radiographic changes are present, bronchial disease is identified by increased visibility of the bronchial walls. It is first important to distinguish the reason for increased visibility. Mineralization of the bronchial wall is usually an incidental finding and is discussed in further detail below. Other reasons for increased visualization are usually pathological and may be secondary to bronchial thickening, mucosal thickening or peribronchial infiltration. These changes may be accompanied by alteration in the size and shape of the bronchial lumen.</p>
<p>It is possible to distinguish between normal bronchi, mineralized bronchi, thickened bronchi and those with shape changes on radiographs (Figures 11.3, 11.4 and 11.5). When bronchial walls are thickened they appear as &#x2018;doughtnuts&#x2019; when viewed end-on or as &#x2018;tramlines&#x2019; when viewed laterally. This is also referred to as a <italic>bronchial pattern</italic> (see also Chapter 12).</p>
<p>Changes in size and shape (e.g. saccular, cylindrical shape when viewed in long axis) of the bronchial lumen, followed by loss of the normal tapering of the bronchial lumen towards the periphery indicate the presence of <italic>bronchiectasis</italic>.</p>
<p>When changes in the interstitial opacity occur around a bronchial structure then &#x2018;<italic>peribronchial cuffing</italic>&#x2019; may be seen. This has a similar appearance to a bronchial pattern but the pathological changes constitute a cellular infiltrate in the interstitium rather than the bronchial wall. An unstructured interstitial pattern may also be present.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial and peribronchial mineralization</title>
<p>Mineralization of the bronchial walls along the bronchial tree makes smaller bronchi more readily identifiable. This mineralization is a common and clinically insignificant finding in older animals but can also be seen in younger animals, especially in chondrodystrophoid breeds of dog. It results in the bronchial walls appearing as fine linear shadows when viewed laterally or as fine distinct circles when viewed end-on. These<italic> thin</italic> mineralized &#x2018;rings&#x2019; and &#x2018;tramlines&#x2019; should be differentiated from the thicker soft tissue opacities seen in bronchial disease (Figure 12.26, p. 254).</p>
<p>Bronchial mineralization may also be seen in systemic pathological conditions, such as hyperadrenocorticism and renal secondary hyperparathyroidism (Figure 12.27, p. 254).</p>
<p>In cats calcification of the peribronchial mucus glands may occur without clinical signs. These are seen as small multifocal mineralized opacities, and may be difficult to distinguish from the rare condition broncholithiasis (see Diseases, below).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial obstruction</title>
<p>Bronchial obstruction can be produced by a variety of mechanisms (Figure 11.6). The same classification system can be applied to tracheal obstruction (see Chapter 10).</p>
<p>Morphological obstruction is a structural obstruction of the bronchus and may be further classified as intraluminal, intramural or extramural, depending on the origin of the obstruction. Morphological obstructions may be complete or incomplete depending on their size and location. Rarely a morphological obstruction (especially a foreign body) can create a &#x2018;check valve&#x2019; effect where air is permitted to pass the obstruction during inspiration when the bronchial lumen is wider, but not during expiration when the lumen is narrower. This results in peripheral air trapping and overinflation. This change may not be apparent on inspiratory radiographs but will be identified as a hyperlucent region of lung on expiratory films.</p>
<p>Functional obstructions occur when the bronchi constrict with resultant air trapping. This may occur in asthma or allergic bronchitis and is discussed further below (see Feline chronic lower airway disease).</p>
<p>Dynamic obstructions occur when there is loss of the normal recoil or rigidity of the bronchial walls, resulting in flattening or collapse during forcible expiration or coughing. This condition often accompanies tracheal collapse and is discussed in more detail below (see Bronchial collapse).</p>
<p>The radiographic features of bronchial obstruction depend on the location and degree of the obstruction, the effectiveness of collateral ventilation and the chronicity of the condition (see Figure 11.6).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchography</title>
<p>Bronchography has been used in the past to outline the bronchial tree (see Figure 1.19, p. 12) and therefore allow for further investigation of bronchial disease. It was considered especially useful for the evaluation of chronic obstructive airway disease, chronic bronchitis, bronchial spasm, bronchiectasis (Figure 11.7), bronchial stenosis or compression, bronchogenic neoplasms (see Figure 12.49, p. 265), bronchial cysts and in the identification of radiolucent bronchial foreign material. The contrast medium agent most commonly used was an aqueous suspension of propyliodine.</p>
<p>Although the procedure was relatively simple it was not well tolerated by the patient and only one lung at a time could be assessed bronchographically. Fibre- optic bronchoscopy and bronchial computed tomography (CT) are less invasive and have completely replaced this technique.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial computed tomography</title>
<p>Bronchi and bronchioles are readily visible and easily assessed on thoracic CT examinations in both the dog and cat. The correct choice of algorithm and image display is essential. A standard axial or spiral lung protocol is usually employed throughout the thorax, followed by a high-resolution series (thin slice width, high kV and mA, and high spatial frequency reconstruction algorithms) through the areas of interest. As for lung CT, it is important to obtain images without respiratory motion (see also Chapter 3). A lung window should always be used when examining the lung parenchyma. Small focal lung lesions will not be visualized in a soft tissue window.</p>
<p>The bronchi are seen as thin-walled branching structures with well demarcated, smooth, hyperattenuating inner and outer walls (Figure 11.8). They are generally accompanied by a pulmonary artery and vein. Usually, the artery lies closer and follows the course of the bronchus more rigidly than the vein. The bronchi and larger bronchioles are easily visible, but the smaller bronchioles become increasingly difficult to identify towards the periphery of the lung. They may not be definitively identified within 1 cm of the periphery of the lung margin. Attempts have been made to characterize normal bronchial wall thickness and cross-sectional areas in the dog. In human thoracic CT, well established bronchial measurements and ratios are used to assess wall thickening and bronchiectasis.</p>
<p>CT provides many advantages over standard thoracic radiographs in the evaluation of the smaller airways. Bronchial rupture may be confirmed and localized. Intraluminal material such as foreign bodies and mucus plugs are easily identified. CT achieves visualization of tiny bronchioles that cannot be accessed by bronchoscopy and also has the advantage that intravenous contrast medium can be administered to aid in the differentiation of neoplastic and inflammatory intraluminal masses from foreign material. Bronchiectasis, whilst sometimes difficult to evaluate radiographically, can be definitively identified with lung CT (Figure 11.9). Different types of bronchiectasis may be distinguished on CT images, such as traction bronchiectasis seen in conditions of interstitial fibrosis (see Chapter 12). Dynamic CT studies may be used in the evaluation of bronchial collapse in dynamic airway disease just as for the trachea (see Chapter 10).</p>
<p>CT is helpful in the differentiation of peribronchial infiltrates and peribronchial masses from true bronchial masses and also provides valuable information for presurgical planning (see Figures 12.38, p. 260 and 12.61a, p. 270). Multiplanar reconstructions may be particularly useful. CT-guided biopsy can be used for further evaluation of bronchial and peribronchial mass lesions. This is a useful and relatively safe procedure when minimal aerated lung is penetrated to obtain a tissue sample. CT is also useful for staging neoplastic bronchial disease, as the bronchial and tracheobronchial lymph nodes can be visually assessed for evidence of metastatic disease (see Chapter 8).</p>
<p>A rapidly developing technique in the human medical field is the use of multidetector CT to obtain non-invasive &#x2018;virtual bronchoscopy&#x2019; images. The images produced closely resemble those seen with fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Although it is widely considered that this technique will not replace standard fibreoptic bronchoscopy, it has value in certain clinical situations and may be used to direct more invasive procedures.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial ultrasonography</title>
<p>The presence of aerated lung surrounding bronchial structures means that they are inaccessible to ultrasonographic examination. However, bronchi are occasionally seen on an ultrasound examination when the surrounding lung lobe is collapsed or consolidated, eliminating the air content, thus providing an acoustic window for the evaluation of intrapulmonary structures including the bronchi. When fluid is present within the bronchial lumen they are referred to as &#x2018;fluid bronchograms&#x2019; (see Chapter 12). It is also possible to identify bronchiectasis in this situation.</p>

<title>Diseases</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Canine chronic bronchitis</title>
<p>Chronic bronchitis is an inflammatory disease of the airways. Animals usually present with a history of <italic>chronic harsh cough</italic> (more than 2 months) and exercise intolerance. Typically middle-aged to older small-breed dogs are predisposed, but the disease is also common in large breeds. Tracheal sensitivity may be present on clinical examination and inspiratory crackles and expiratory wheezes may be identified on auscultation. Heart rate is usually normal to low and a pronounced sinus arrhythmia may be present.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of chronic bronchitis in the dog and cat is usually one of exclusion. Other conditions such as infectious airway disease, structural airway disease (collapse, bronchiectasis) and neoplasia must be ruled out.</p>
<p>The condition is never completely cured but can be controlled by a combination of medical therapy, weight loss and environmental changes (reduced smoke, pollutants, heat, etc.). When poorly controlled, bronchitis may result in irreversible bronchiectasis and even pulmonary hypertension (secondary to chronic hypoxia and/or vascular remodelling).</p>

<p>It should be noted that radiographic changes may not be present. Normal thoracic radiographs do not rule out chronic bronchitis.</p>

</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Canine acute bronchitis</title>
<p>Thoracic radiographs in cases of acute bronchitis are indicated mainly to rule out other diseases or complications, especially if clinical signs are severe or prolonged. Many animals with acute bronchitis show no radiographic changes. Acute bronchitis may appear as a bronchial pattern irrespective of the cause and radiographic findings are similar to those seen in canine chronic bronchitis (see above).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Feline chronic lower airway disease</title>
<p>Feline chronic lower airway disease encompasses a multitude of small airway diseases in the cat including <italic>feline asthma</italic>. Inflammation of the airways leads to a reversible obstruction to airflow (functional obstruction) and hence air trapping. The obstruction is due to a combination of bronchoconstriction, bronchial wall oedema and submucosal gland hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Clinical signs vary from chronic coughing and wheezing to severe respiratory distress. The condition can affect cats of any age with Siamese appearing to have an increased incidence. Hyper-responsive airways and reversible airflow obstruction lead to a reduced airway diameter and increased airway resistance. The condition can be extremely severe in presentation and care should be taken when handling dyspnoeic cats.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographs may be normal. It should be noted that the severity of the radiographic signs may not correlate with the clinical signs. Findings include:

<list-item><p>Classically <italic>peribronchial cuffing</italic> is identified, although a variety of bronchial, interstitial and alveolar lung patterns (Figure 11.10) may be observed</p></list-item>

</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchiectasis</title>
<p>The word bronchiectasis was derived from the Greek words &#x2018;bronchos&#x2019; meaning bronchus and &#x2018;ectasis&#x2019; meaning extension. Bronchiectasis is irreversible <italic>bronchial dilatation</italic> often with accumulation of pulmonary secretions. It can be focal or disseminated and it is uncommon in dogs and rare in cats. In cats, a predisposition for older males has been described.</p>
<p>It can occur as a sequel to long-standing infectious or inflammatory pulmonary disease, secondary to airway obstruction or smoke inhalation, as a complication to radiation-induced pneumonitis or in association with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Also, it has been noted that halothane dilates airways by blocking baseline vagal tone.</p>
<p>Bronchial secretions accumulate in the dilated bronchi and predispose the patient to recurrent airway and pulmonary infections.</p>
<p>Dogs with bronchiectasis are commonly presented with a history of chronic productive coughing and recurring pneumonia that initially responds to antibiotics.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">

<title>Primary ciliary dyskinesia</title>
<p>Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), also known as <italic>immotile cilia syndrome</italic>, is a diverse group of inherited structural and functional abnormalities of the respiratory and other cilia, which results in recurrent respiratory tract infections in the dog. More specifically, PCD is an inherited defect in microtubule formation, affecting cilia of the respiratory and urogenital tract and the auditory canal.</p>
<p>Typically PCD is diagnosed in young purebred animals with a reported higher incidence in the Bichon Frise. The condition may be seen in mixed breed dogs and also in cats.</p>
<p>There is a relatively high prevalence of a respiratory disease and the phenotype is almost identical to PCD in humans. The respiratory manifestations include chronic rhinitis, bronchitis and severe pneumonia with or without bronchiectasis. Affected animals are presented with recurrent chronic nasal discharge, productive cough, respiratory distress and exercise intolerance. Additional findings are infertility, hydrocephalus and loss of hearing.</p>
<p>Assessment of deficient mucociliary transport is initially performed with nuclear scintigraphy. Transmission electron microscopy of nasal or bronchial respiratory epithelium or seminal samples provides confirmation of the diagnosis.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">

<title>Scintigraphy</title>
<p>To perform a scintigraphic study (see Chapter 5) a droplet of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA is deposited in the distal aspect of the trachea. The diagnosis is confirmed by the absence of movement of the radiopharmaceutical droplet throughout the scintigraphic study (Figure 11.17). It should be noted that droplet movement <italic>always</italic> indicates normal ciliary function (i.e. no false-negatives). Findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>False-positives (no droplet movement) may occur if the droplet is deposited in an ulcerated area of the trachea, in an area of thick mucus or inside the endotracheal tube</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Occasionally the droplet may move initially, then come to a stop; this happens most commonly because the droplet comes in contact with the end of the endotracheal tube or because it encounters an area of exudate, mucus or ulceration.</p></list-item>

<title>Kartagener&#x2019;s syndrome</title>
<p>Kartagener&#x2019;s syndrome is an uncommon congenital condition that has been reported in several breeds of dogs. It can be considered as a subset of PCD and is characterized by PCD with situs inversus, rhinosinusitis and bronchiectasis.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial collapse</title>
<p>Bronchial collapse may occur concurrently with tracheal collapse (see Chapter 10). Usually animals are presented with a history of chronic non-productive cough or respiratory difficulty. The condition is more common in dogs (especially small and toy breeds) than in cats. The disease is caused by progressive bronchial cartilage degeneration and results in a dynamic bronchial obstruction. Changes may occur in the mainstem bronchi and/or the more peripheral smaller airways. The remainder of this discussion refers to mainstem bronchial collapse. The gold standard for diagnosis of this condition is fibreoptic bronchoscopy. However, radiographic and fluoroscopic examination provide a preliminary two-dimensional (2D) evaluation and dynamic CT may provide a non-invasive screening alternative to bronchoscopy.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:</p>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Narrowed lumen</italic> of principal or lobar bronchi near the carina. This may be demonstrated better on a lateral thoracic radiograph taken during expiration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung fields are usually normal.</p></list-item>
<p>Fluoroscopic and bronchoscopic examination are usually required for evaluation of intrathoracic airway collapse and the mainstem bronchi.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Fluoroscopy</title>
<p>This provides dynamic evaluation of bronchial lumen changes and associated tracheal collapse. The patient can remain conscious for evaluation and can also be assessed during an induced cough. It is surpassed by fibreoptic bronchoscopy as fluoroscopy remains a 2D study.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>This allows identification of the narrowed or collapsed bronchus. Other causes of narrowing such as external compression or intraluminal material can be excluded. Dynamic CT may be used for real-time assessment of collapse.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial foreign body</title>
<p>A variety of foreign bodies may be inhaled, for example plant awns, toys, pebbles, bones, peanuts, dental calculus and even teeth.</p>
<p>The foreign body may cause complete or incomplete morphological bronchial obstruction and hence a wide spectrum of radiographic changes (see Figures 1.19, p. 12, 6.5, p. 85 and 11.7). Smooth foreign bodies (metal, marbles, pebbles) do not cause irritation, but usually cause obstruction. These do not usually pass beyond the carina. Irritant foreign bodies (such as seeds or grass awns with rough surfaces) may cause intense focal bronchial irritation with or without obstruction.</p>
<p>Bronchial foreign bodies should be considered in animals with an acute onset progressing to chronic cough. Animals with laryngeal paralysis are more likely to aspirate material. Eventually pneumonia, bronchiectasis and even pulmonary abscessation may result. Identification of the underlying cause can be a diagnostic challenge.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>The foreign body will be visible if it is radiopaque. No radiographic changes may be seen in the early stages if the foreign body is radiolucent and collateral ventilation is maintained.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Complete blockage of a mainstem bronchus with loss of collateral ventilation causes lobar atelectasis and a resultant increase in opacity and a mediastinal shift towards the affected lobe. Pleural effusion may be seen around the collapsed lobe.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complete blockage of a smaller bronchus with collateral ventilation maintained may cause no radiographic changes or focal consolidations due to infection, and trapped secretions, especially </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>	along a bronchus (Figure 11.18), may be identified.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Incomplete obstruction with &#x2018;check valve&#x2019; effect appears as a hyperlucency and volume gain (mediastinal shift away from the lesion). It is important to acquire both end-expiratory and end-inspiratory radiographs to aid diagnosis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An irritant non-obstructing foreign body causes a focal interstitial opacity with central radiolucency and increased bronchial pattern (Figure 11.19), resulting from focal pneumonia. Over time more severe pneumonia, bronchiectasis and lung abscessation are seen.</p></list-item>
<p>Hypertrophic osteopathy associated with a bronchial foreign body has been reported in a dog.</p>
<p>It should be noted that migrating grass awns may initially present as a <italic>spontaneous pneumothorax</italic> and later as a paralumbar abscess or draining tract with adjacent spondylitis.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>CT is more sensitive than radiography in the detection of bronchial foreign bodies (see Figure 11.19). Secondary pulmonary changes, bronchiectasis and pleural effusion may also be seen and their severity assessed more accurately.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial neoplasia</title>
<p>Bronchial tumours are a type of primary pulmonary tumour. Primary pulmonary tumours are uncommon in dogs and cats. Most primary lung tumours arising from the bronchial epithelium are carcinomas. Cytology and histopathology can provide the definitive diagnosis. Bronchoalveolar carcinoma, for example, has the unique characteristic of extension along the airways and alveolar septa with occasional projections into the alveolar lumen.</p>
<p>The clinical signs of animals with bronchial tumours vary. Chronic cough unresponsive to antibiotics, exercise intolerance, tachypnoea and overt respiratory distress may be seen in dogs. Cats may be presented with signs including anorexia, weight loss, lethargy, tachypnoea, dyspnoea and non-productive cough.</p>
<p>Regional lymph nodes, the pleura and other organs should be assessed for metastatic disease. CT is particularly useful in this respect and should be considered when surgical resection is contemplated.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Canine bronchoalveolar carcinoma (Figure 11.20; see also Figures 12.23, p. 253, 12.40, p. 261, 12.68, p. 274). A varied radiographic appearance has been reported. Solitary nodules, multiple non-circumscribed interstitial nodules, diffuse opacities or alveolar consolidation may be seen</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Feline bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Three main patterns have been described: mixed bronchoalveolar pattern, ill defined alveolar mass and mass with cavitation. All cats have a co-existing bronchial pattern. Cavitation is common, suggesting a tendency for the tumour to form necrotic centres. Mineralization should increase the degree of suspicion for neoplasia. Beware: neoplasia may mimic severe feline chronic lower airway disease.</p></list-item>
<p>Enlarged hilar lymph nodes may also be identified; these are suggestive of metastatic disease. Pleural effusion may be seen and pleural metastases have been reported.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>This is more sensitive than radiography for the detection of small lesions. It allows excellent assessment of the location and course of the tumour, the presence of tissue within the bronchial lumen, cavitation and necrosis, mineralization, etc.</p>
<p>The CT appearance of bronchial neoplasms (Figure 11.21) is variable. CT-guided biopsy may be performed. CT is extremely useful for surgical planning. It may detect enlarged regional lymph nodes suggestive of metastasis and thus assist with tumour staging.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title>
<p>The use of thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is experimental in lung cancer diagnosis and treatment in humans. It has the potential to provide more accurate information on tumour extension/margins before surgical resection.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial rupture</title>
<p>Bronchial rupture is uncommon; tracheal rupture is more common. Usually the rupture occurs within 1&#x2013;4 cm of the tracheal bifurcation. The most common causes are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Blunt trauma to the neck and/or thorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chronic cough</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Venepuncture resulting in bronchial rupture and resultant fatal tension pneumothorax has been reported in a kitten. The aetiology was considered most likely to be occlusion of the upper airways (either directly or due to laryngospasm) plus pressure on the chest or alternatively due to stretching and twisting of the bronchial tree</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Traumatic avulsion of the left principal bronchus has also been reported in a cat</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Foreign body.</p></list-item>
<p>Bronchial rupture will usually result in pneumomediastinum and/or pneumothorax (less common), depending on the location and orientation of the tear. Free gas commonly tracks under the bronchial serosa into the mediastinum.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In cases of tracheal rupture, tracheal discontinuity may be identified on survey radiographs; bronchoscopy is more helpful for identification of bronchial rupture.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>Tracheobronchoscopy is usually employed in this situation, but CT may be useful if this technique has failed to identify the location of the rupture. CT is able to localize small peribronchial gas pockets suggestive of bronchial rupture (see Figure 8.25, p. 189).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia</title>
<p>Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a rare inflammatory condition in the cat and dog and is a multifactorial disease. The characteristic pathohistological finding is granulated tissue plugs within the lumen of small airways, which extend into the alveolar ducts and alveoli. Definitive diagnosis relies on lung biopsy. In humans BOOP may be secondary to a usual interstitial pneumonia. A few case reports exist in dogs, and CT and open or keyhole lung biopsy have been used successfully for diagnosis.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographically various combinations of bronchial, interstitial and alveolar patterns may be seen. One case report in the dog describes a diffuse interstitial pattern in all lung fields. Commonly patchy areas of alveolar pattern and bronchial wall thickening are seen. The radiographic changes are non-specific.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>CT has been reported as a sensitive technique for this condition. One canine case report describes bilateral asymmetrical areas of air space consolidation and bronchial dilatation.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial microlithiasis</title>
<p>Miliary broncholithiasis is a rare sequel to inflammatory bronchial disease reported in cats. Inspissated mucopurulent plugs with calcified concretions are found throughout the bronchi. It can lead to obstructive resorption atelectasis and compensatory emphysema.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Small mineralized opacities scattered throughout the lung fields contained within the bronchi (Figure 11.22)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Atelectasis of obstructed lobes/areas possible</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compensatory hyperinflation and emphysema.</p></list-item>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Broncho-oesophageal fistula</title>
<p>Broncho-oesophageal fistulae may be congenital or acquired. The latter may occur secondary to trauma or an oesophageal or bronchial foreign body. The result of the condition is usually a recurring aspiration pneumonia and hence cough. Definitive diagnosis is by oesophagography (see Chapters 1 and 9), although the fistula may occasionally be recognized on endoscopic examination.</p>
</sec3>

<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:

<title>Normal aspect of the lungs</title>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Lobar anatomy</title>
<p>Dogs and cats have two lungs, which are not symmetrical in terms of size and lobation. The lobar anatomy is based on the bronchial division.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The left lung consists of two lobes (Figure 12.1ab):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Left cranial lung lobe, further divided into a cranial segment and a caudal segment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Left caudal lung lobe.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The right lung consists of four lobes (Figure 12.1ac):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Right cranial lung lobe</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Right middle lung lobe</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Right caudal lung lobe</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Accessory lung lobe.</p></list-item>
<p>The overall volume of the right lung is 25&#x0025; larger than that of the left lung. When the lungs are well inflated, the cranial part of the left cranial lung lobe extends cranially beyond the level of the first ribs and into the right hemithorax. It can be visible on a lateral view, creating a relative lucent area cranial to the first pair of ribs, which is separated from the right cranial lung lobe by a band of soft tissue opacity (cranioventral mediastinal reflection) (see Figures 12.1a and 12.2).</p>
<p>At full inspiration, the right middle lung lobe can expand ventral to the cardiac silhouette. The relatively lucent space between the heart and the sternum, visible on a lateral view, should not be confused with a pneumothorax (Figure 12.3). With incomplete inspiration, the right cranial and middle lung lobes leave a small triangular area free for the right ventricle cranioventrally, termed the cardiac notch, usually at the fourth to fifth intercostal space. This lung-free area is used as a right parasternal window in echocardiography.</p>
<p>In normal animals, the exact margins between the lung lobes are usually not visible due to the fact that the different lobes have a similar opacity and silhouette with each other. Nevertheless, it is useful to know the normal location of pleural fissures as this is where pleural fissure lines and lobar signs will be found in diseased animals:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>On the left side, the cranial segment of the left cranial lung lobe shares limits with two lobes (see Figure 12.1b):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ventrally, with the caudal segment of the left cranial lung lobe; the fissure between the two being located at the level of the fourth intercostal space</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dorsally, with the left caudal lung lobe; the fissure between the two being located at the level of the sixth to seventh intercostal space.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On the right side, the right cranial lung lobe shares limits with two lobes (see Figure 12.1c):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ventrally, with the right middle lung lobe; the fissure between the two being located at the level of the fourth to fifth intercostal space</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dorsally, with the right caudal lung lobe; the fissure between the two being located at the level of the sixth to seventh intercostal space.</p></list-item>

<p>Lung lesions should be described according to their lobar anatomical location if:</p>
<p><BL2></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The specific lobe can be determined</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The lesion distribution follows the lobar anatomy.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Topographical description</title>
<p>Topographical terms are often used to describe a lung area without designating it to a specific lobe. Commonly used terms are (Figure 12.4):</p>
<p><BL2></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cranioventral (outdated synonym: precardial)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Caudoventral (outdated synonym: postcardial)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Caudodorsal</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Midventral (to describe the midventral thoracic area, the term &#x2018;superimposed on the cardiac silhouette<italic>&#x2019;</italic> is frequently used)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Perihilar (synonyms: hilar, central)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Peripheral.</p></list-item>
<p>This terminology can be used in conjunction with the term <italic>lung field</italic> or <italic>zone</italic>, and provides a means to localize a lung lesion accurately where a specific lobe cannot be designated; for example, c<italic>audodorsal lung opacification</italic> based on a single lateral radiograph, instead of <italic>an opacification in one or both of the caudal lung lobes.</italic> These terms are also used to more accurately describe the localization of a lung lesion which does not strictly follow the lobar anatomy in distribution; for example, <italic>perihilar lung opacity</italic> in pulmonary oedema, instead of <italic>an opacification in the craniomedial aspect of both caudal and accessory, and caudodorsomedial aspect of both cranial lung lobes.</italic> The lobar anatomical description is preferred if applicable.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Lung opacity</title>
<p>The normal lung opacity is the result of the summation of:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Gas opacity within the alveoli, bronchioles and bronchi</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Soft tissue opacity of the blood vessels, lung interstitium, bronchial and alveolar walls</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Superimposing soft tissue opacities (e.g. thoracic wall, mediastinum).</p></list-item>
<p>Due to the large proportion of air-filled spaces in the lungs, the normal lung is very lucent (Figure 12.5a). Dogs and cats have very little interstitial lung tissue and no lobular septations (classified as type II lung), which therefore contribute only minimally to the overall lung opacity. A fine reticular background on normal lung tissue, as occasionally seen radiographically, is the result of small vascular and interstitial structures (Figure 12.5b).</p>
<p>The pulmonary vessels can be seen within the parenchyma due to the contrast provided by the surrounding pulmonary gas (Figure 12.5a). Other structures that may be seen in a normal canine lung are the walls of the airways to the level of the primary and secondary divisions of the bronchi; they appear as thin parallel soft tissue or mineralized lines that branch into the periphery (Figure 12.5).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Lung vessels</title>
<p>The lungs contain two distinct vascular systems:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A functional vascular system:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The pulmonary arteries carrying oxygen-deprived blood</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The pulmonary veins carrying oxygen-rich blood.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A nutritional blood supply: the bronchial arteries coming from the aorta, a minor contributor to the pulmonary circulation (1&#x0025; of the cardiac output).</p></list-item>
<p>Only the functional vascular system is radiographically visible. The major pulmonary arteries and veins are the most prominent radiopaque structures within the normal lungs. They are larger at the hilus and then branch and taper progressively towards the periphery. They appear as band-like soft tissue opacities when viewed along their long axis, and as nodule-like opacities when viewed end-on (see Figure 12.5a).</p>
<p>In dogs and cats, the pulmonary arteries are directly adjacent to the bronchial tree along their entire course, whereas the veins separate from the bronchus at the segmental level (bronchoarterial lung type). This means that small pulmonary veins may be seen at some distance from the corresponding bronchus, and that the distance between the arteries and corresponding veins does not exactly represent the bronchial diameter (Figure 12.6). The pulmonary arteries and veins can be differentiated based on their relationship to the mainstem bronchi (Figures 12.7 and 12.8).</p>
<p>The cranial lung lobe arteries and veins can only be differentiated on a lateral view. A left lateral view is better because there is less superimposition of left and right bronchovascular structures. On a left lateral view, the left and right cranial and middle pulmonary vessels are arranged in the following order in an anti-clockwise direction (Figure 12.8a):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Right cranial lobe (most craniodorsal)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cranial segment of the left cranial lobe</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Caudal segment of the left cranial lobe</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Right middle lobe (most caudoventral).</p></list-item>
<p>The right cranial lobe bronchovascular structures can also be located ventral to those of the cranial segment of the left cranial lung lobe on this view. The left cranial lung lobe can be recognized as such because of the short common lobar bronchus, which divides into the cranial and caudal segmental bronchi. Caudal lung lobe arteries and veins can only be differentiated on a dorsoventral (DV) or ventrodorsal (VD) view. A DV view is better because the dorsal part of the caudal lungs is more ventilated than on a VD view (Figure 12.8b). It can be difficult to measure the feline caudal pulmonary arteries and veins on the DV view.</p>
<p>The pulmonary functional circulation is a low pressure system; both arteries and veins are thin-walled and easily distensible and collapsible by physiological or pathological processes. Pulmonary arteries and veins should be approximately the same size, but it is common to see arteries that are slightly larger than the veins in normal animals.</p>

<title>Lung opacity and aeration</title>
<p>Air does not attenuate the X-ray beam; therefore, a change in the amount of pulmonary air does not directly affect lung opacity. However, secondary effects associated with lung expansion and retraction do affect the opacity of the lungs. With inspiration or lung inflation the expanding lungs:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Replace more opaque extrathoracic structures in the image</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compress the heart and the easily collapsible pulmonary vessels. These fluctuations in intrapulmonary blood content are the main reason for respiration-related differences in lung opacity (Figure 12.9).</p></list-item>
<p>The opacity of the lung tissue cranial and caudal to the cardiac silhouette can differ under normal conditions. Large amounts of superimposing soft tissue cranially (shoulders, cranial mediastinum) can make the lungs appear more opaque in this location. Conversely, expiratory views may reveal more opaque caudal lung tissue. Due to the larger amount of lung tissue caudally, and the mobility of the diaphragm, respiratory changes have a higher net result on opacification in this location.</p>
<p>Lung tissue in the mid-thorax can be difficult to evaluate due to the superimposition of the cardiac silhouette. However, the ventral pleural margin can often be identified as a curtain-like structure over the ventral aspect of the cardiac silhouette, and can be used as a landmark (Figure 12.10).</p>
<p>Only a fraction of the normal lung capacity is needed in a normal dog and cat at rest. Consequently, the lungs are often not fully expanded and partial collapse occurs (Figure 12.10). Collapse occurs preferentially at the lung periphery and in the dependent part of the animal. Collapsed lung becomes a soft tissue opacity and radiographically visible if:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A large enough area of lung has completely collapsed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It has structural features, such as air bronchograms</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is contrasted by surrounding aerated lung.</p></list-item>
<p>A large area of incomplete collapse may create only a generalized subtle increase in overall opacity, insufficient to outline the collapsed lung. Physiological lung collapse is a diagnostic problem because:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Radiographically visible collapsed lung is difficult to distinguish from lung pathology</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collapsed lung silhouettes with potential soft tissue lesions.</p></list-item>
<p>To minimize the effect of lung collapse it is therefore useful to obtain lateral radiographs in both left and right recumbency. On a right lateral view, the non-dependent left lung is more aerated and hence easier to interpret. On a left lateral view, the non-dependent right lung is more aerated and hence easier to interpret. This is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon but rather a gradual one. It would not be correct to assume that all radiolucent areas must belong to the non-dependent lung and all radiopaque areas to the dependent lung. However, by comparing both views it can usually be established whether a lung area with soft tissue opacity is more likely to be a dependency-related lung collapse (less opaque in non-dependent position) or a pathological lung lesion (equally or more opaque in non-dependent position). An additional DV/VD view can prove extremely helpful (lung opacity, mediastinal shift) to confirm or refute the radiographic diagnosis.</p>
<p>General anaesthesia promotes lung collapse. It is associated with prolonged recumbency and shallow breathing, and less lung tissue is needed for gas exchange (complete rest, ventilation with oxygen rather than air). Thoracic radiography should therefore be avoided during general anaesthesia and be scheduled before or after the procedure instead. Alternatively, the lungs can be inflated and radiographed in a state of maximal expansion. Manual bag holding is necessary for this technique, which requires appropriate shielding of personnel.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Age and breed variations</title>
<p>Puppies and kittens often have more opaque lungs than adults, which is probably due to an increased water content of the interstitial lung parenchyma and the presence of a thymus (Figure 12.11).</p>
<p>Linear (and much less commonly nodular) markings of interstitial origin increase the overall lung opacity in normal old dogs. This should not be misinterpreted as abnormal. Bronchial markings can be more prominent in older dogs and cats, without being associated with current bronchial disease. Heterotopic bone (also known as pulmonary osteomas, pneumoliths or pleural plaques) can form in the lungs and pleura of skeletally mature dogs, and be radiographically visible as small (1&#x2013;4 mm) nodules of mineral opacity (Figure 12.12). They are particularly common in Collie breeds. They should not be mistaken for metastatic lung lesions. Similarly sized metastases would not be sufficiently opaque to be radiographically visible (with the rare exception of mineralized metastases and miliary lung lesions).</p>
<p>In some animals, thickening of the pleural surface allows the margins of the lobes to be seen, where the X-ray beam is tangential to the border between two lobes.</p>
<p>In chondrodystrophic dogs, early mineralization of the bronchial cartilages is common, and the bronchial walls therefore become clearly identified as parallel lines accompanying the vascular structures, or as ring-like structures when viewed end-on.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Species differences</title>
<p>Cranial lung expansion (cranial to the first ribs) is more pronounced in dogs. The feline lung commonly extends further caudally than the canine lung (at peak inspiration to the level of T12&#x2013;13 in dogs, and L1&#x2013;2 in cats).</p>
<p>In dogs, the dorsal lung margins are completely superimposed on the ventral aspect of the thoracolumbar spine. In cats, the caudodorsal lung margin is separated from the spine by the psoas minor muscle, which originates at the ventral surface of the last two thoracic vertebrae (the last thoracic vertebra in the dog) (Figure 12.13).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Body condition</title>
<p>Obese animals have large amounts of fat around and within the thoracic cavity, which leads to increased X-ray attenuation and generation of scatter radiation. The net result is an increased lung opacity (Figure 12.14) with poor visibility of the bronchovascular structures. Intrathoracic fat restricts full lung expansion during inspiration, which also contributes to the more opaque appearance of the lungs in these animals. These changes should not be mistaken for pathologically increased lung opacity.</p>
<p>In lean dogs and cats, and in deep-chested dogs, the lungs tend to look very lucent. A close inspection with a highly luminescent light source should reveal normal bronchovascular structures and thereby differentiate this variation from a pneumothorax.</p>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interpretive principles</title>

<list-item><p>Wide range of normal anatomical and physiological variations</p></list-item>

<p>Radiologists have developed interpretive principles for the lungs, which are an adaptation of the classic R&#x00F6;ntgen signs. These principles are constantly refined, challenged, changed and individualized, indicating that there is no perfect system to interpret the lungs radiographically. In the following paragraphs the classic interpretive principles to approach the lungs are discussed, and newer alternative ways of appraisal are provided. Regardless of the approach utilized, the final differential list for a given radiographic appearance should remain the same.</p>

<title>Lung patterns</title>
<p>A radiographic pattern is a descriptive term to characterize a regionally or diffusely distributed disease. Lung patterns are an attempt to correlate imaging features of increased lung opacity with the morphological correlate of the lung (Figure 12.18):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Alveolar airspace</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bronchi</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vessels</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Connective tissue (interstitium).</p></list-item>
<p>If only one component is pathologically altered, pattern recognition allows a relatively short list of differential diagnoses. In most lung diseases, more than one component is pathologically altered and a mixed pattern is evident radiographically. Usually one component is most affected and will be radiographically dominant; the predominating radiographic pattern should be treated as the most relevant.</p>
<p>Lung pattern recognition will not be a useful exercise if:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Used to describe a focal lesion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Anatomical and physiological alteration cannot be ruled out</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A mixed pattern with multiple equally contributing components is evident.</p></list-item>
<p>The lung pattern approach is designed to explain why lung opacity is increased. If this question has already been answered, the pattern designation does not contribute to the diagnosis and should be avoided. For example, with a large soft tissue mass in a lung lobe, avoid the attribute <italic>alveolar</italic>.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Alveolar lung pattern</title>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Classic radiographic features:</title>
<p>Increased lung opacity contributed by the alveolar space occurs if:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The alveoli are completely collapsed and void of any air</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The alveoli are filled with fluid or soft tissue material (Figure 12.19).</p></list-item>
<p>The features of the alveolar lung pattern do not translate into a direct visualization of the alveoli, but into a set of more abstract features (Figure 12.20):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Homogenous soft tissue opacification</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Border obliteration with adjacent soft tissue structures or fluid</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Air bronchograms (see below) if bronchi are air-filled.</p></list-item>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Air bronchogram:</title>
<p>When a lung collapses or consolidates, a bronchus may remain gas-filled and open because the bronchial cartilage resists collapse, or the vast alveolar airspace fills up with fluid or exudates prior to the airways. In this situation, an air-filled bronchus surrounded by lung of soft tissue opacity may be visible radiographically, and is called an <italic>air bronchogram</italic> (see Figure 12.20). It indicates:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Lung pathology. Air bronchograms cannot be created by superimposing opacities (e.g. pleural effusion, mediastinal mass)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Alveolar lung pattern. Air bronchograms cannot be created by any other pattern.</p></list-item>
<p>Air bronchograms may not be seen in every case of alveolar lung disease, but their presence is pathognomonic for the alveolar lung pattern. Absence does not rule out alveolar lung pattern.</p>
<p><italic>Margination:</italic>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>If the affected area is smaller than the lobe (Figure 12.21) there are indistinct margins (fluffy, resemblance to a cloud).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If an entire lobe is affected (Figure 12.22) there is border obliteration with adjacent soft tissue structures (e.g. cardiac silhouette, diaphragm) or a lobar sign if the neighbouring lobe is aerated (see below).</p></list-item>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>The lobar sign:</title>
<p>The border between two lung lobes becomes distinguishable if one is consolidated/collapsed and the other one normally aerated. This seemingly trivial feature is called a <italic>lobar sign</italic> (see Figure 12.22). However, it is a useful sign in that it is a pathognomonic feature of the alveolar lung pattern and differential to a fissure line in pleural effusion:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fissure line: two lucent lung lobes separated by an opaque band</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lobar sign: directly adjacent opaque and lucent lung area.</p></list-item>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Size of affected lung lobes:</title>
<p>If a large enough area of the lung is affected by alveolar lung disease, the lung lobe size may change and allow distinction between collapsed and consolidated lung. This is best visualized on a DV/VD radiograph and assessed via the mediastinal shift:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Consolidated lung may be normal or increased in size, and if enlarged may cause a shift of the mediastinal structures away from it (Figure 12.23)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collapsed lung will be decreased in size and may cause a shift of the mediastinal structures towards it (see Figure 12.22)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chronic collapse, especially in cats with right middle lung lobe collapse secondary to airway disease, may result in hyperinflation of adjacent lobes and resolution of the mediastinal shift.</p></list-item>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Partial or non-consolidating alveolar lung pattern:</title>
<p>In many situations, the alveolar airspace of an affected lung area is mostly, but not completely, collapsed or consolidated. The resulting radiographic pattern then consists of a heterogenous soft tissue opacification with residual lucent spots (Figure 12.24). This is colloquially referred to as a &#x2018;salt-and-pepper&#x2019; appearance. Residual lucent grape-like air spaces are occasionally referred to as <italic>air alveolograms.</italic> There may or may not be distinctive air bronchograms. There is usually no border obliteration or lobar sign. Partial alveolar pattern is arguably more common than complete lung consolidation.</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bronchial lung pattern</title>
<p>Increased lung opacity contributed by the bronchial tree can be caused by the following (see also Chapter 11):

<sec4 id="ch-ss">

<list-item><p>Thick walled: inflamed, infiltrated bronchi (usually not as prominent as ring shadows).</p></list-item>
<p>Many peripherally distended irregular bronchi may be seen (bronchiectasis) (see Chapter 11). Differentiation of the bronchial lung pattern from a normal variation can be challenging, because mild to moderate bronchial mineralization is a normal feature in skeletally mature dogs.

It is unknown whether this is attributable to normal degeneration, or to current subclinical or previous disease.</p>

<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Classic radiographic appearance:</title>
<p>There are multiple nodules of soft tissue opacity throughout lung fields (Figures 12.31 and 12.32). The opacity correlates with nodule size and number.</p>
<p>Radiographic visibility of lung nodules is size-dependent. A minimal diameter of 3&#x2013;5 mm is required for a single soft tissue nodule to be visible. Larger nodules are more opaque. Visibility depends on there being a large enough area of aerated lung tissue surrounding the lesion; visibility is poor in a small lung area superimposed on a large soft tissue structure (heart, liver) and nodules will be poorly visible or not visible if surrounded by collapsed/consolidated lung.</p>
<p>Superimposed body wall structures can mimic pulmonary nodules, e.g. costochondral junctions or nipples. They are often multiple with a regular distribution, and can often be identified on the orthogonal view.</p>

<p>The interstitial lung pattern is one of the most elusive radiographic features.

<p>Normal lung opacity is mainly composed of air and blood vessels. Normal lungs appear mostly black (gas opacity) with bands of soft tissue opacity (pulmonary blood vessels). Other pulmonary structures (e.g. bronchial walls) should only minimally contribute to the overall opacity. There is a wide range of normal breed, age and physiological variation in lung opacity, and technically related differences.</p>

<title>Prioritizing the differential diagnosis</title>
<p>Prioritization is an essential last step to establish a <italic>meaningful</italic> diagnosis. Hedging behind endless lists of differential diagnoses does not help the treatment and prognosis of the patient. A definitive diagnosis should be stated clearly whenever possible or when one disease is much more likely than others; for example, a cranioventral air space pattern in a coughing dog with megaoesophagus and fever is most likely to be due to aspiration pneumonia. Other differentials can be thought of (e.g. coincidental pulmonary haemorrhage) but are no more common than chance, i.e. unrelated to the radiographic feature (e.g. patient could coincidentally also have a brain tumour).</p>
<p>In most circumstances, there are several likely diseases that could cause a similar radiographic pattern. In this situation, the list of possibilities should be kept reasonably short and be prioritized by incorporating knowledge of test accuracy and prior probability of disease, which is best estimated by knowing the patient&#x2019;s signalment (age, sex and breed), chief complaint and pertinent history or findings. This may be the most influential step in the process of making an accurate radiographic diagnosis.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, a very large number of diseases could create a similar radiographic pattern. In this situation a differential list would be very long and could not be prioritized, and is therefore not useful. It is then sufficient to say that pulmonary disease is present but the cause is not determined.</p>

<title>Diseases</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Solid pulmonary masses</title>
<p>A pulmonary mass is a fluid, soft tissue or mineralized structure replacing, compressing or displacing the air-filled portion of the lung (Figure 12.37). The clinical implications rest on the assessment of whether the mass is benign or malignant. It can be difficult to differentiate between various types of lung mass solely on imaging features; however, a prioritized differential diagnoses list can be created based on the imaging characteristics described below and other factors, such as:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Age</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Species and breed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Geographical area where animal lives or has travelled to</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Additional diagnostic tests.</p></list-item>
<p>Cystic masses are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Thoracic radiography is usually the initial examination. Radiographically, a pulmonary mass is evident as a discrete opacity, surrounded by (more) lucent lung. Most pulmonary masses are expansile and displace, rather than contain, major airway structures (Figure 12.38). Common features of such masses are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Bronchial deviation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Absence of air bronchograms.</p></list-item>
<p>However, a minority of lung masses are infiltrative and can contain and occlude bronchi (Figure 12.39).</p>
<p>Both types of mass can result in bronchial obstruction and subsequent pulmonary atelectasis or secondary haemorrhage and infection, which can result in:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A large area of alveolar lung disease with air bronchograms and a lobar sign</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Border obliteration between the mass and the adjacent secondary lung changes, making size assessment difficult.</p></list-item>
<p>Features of the alveolar lung pattern can therefore in some circumstances be suggestive of, but are not indicative for, the assessment of the growth pattern of a mass.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Classic R&#x00F6;ntgen signs:</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Size: lesion up to 3 cm is termed<italic></italic> a<italic> nodule</italic>; lesion larger than 3 cm is termed a <italic>mass</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Shape: usually round (equal growth in each direction) but other shapes are possible, especially at the lung margins.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Opacity: usually soft tissue opacity. There may be a central lucency in cavitated lesions, and a mineralized centre may be seen due to dystrophic mineralization.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Location: random. Some diseases extend from the mediastinal lymph nodes into the adjacent perihilar lung tissue (lymphomatoid granulomatosis).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Number: solitary or multiple.</p></list-item>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Neoplasia:</bold></italic> Primary pulmonary neoplasia typically presents as a <italic>solitary nodule</italic> (Figure 12.40) or <italic>mass</italic> (see Figures 12.38a, 12.39a and 12.41). It may be accompanied by additional smaller lesions, representing metastatic disease from the primary neoplasia. Occasionally, concurrent cranial mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy and/or pleural effusion are radiographically visible.</p>
<p>A small solitary nodule is equally likely to be metastatic or primary neoplasia. The larger the nodule is, the more likely it is to be primary neoplasia. Pulmonary neoplasia can also manifest as <italic>diffuse parenchymal disease</italic>:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Interstitial, peribronchial infiltration or a patchy alveolar pattern is possible (e.g. interstitial pattern in canine lymphoma; see Figure 12.34)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May be caused by complications of the neoplastic disease, such as inflammation, infection or haemorrhage</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Lobar consolidation</italic> occurs if a lung lobe is gradually infiltrated or if the lobar bronchus is obstructed by the mass (Figure 12.42). Examples include:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (a rare primary pulmonary angiodestructive neoplasm seen mainly in young to middle-aged dogs). The lung lobe typically has an <italic>increased volume</italic>, resulting in convex, bulging borders</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bronchogenic carcinoma may also occlude a bronchus, causing atelectasis and thus <italic>loss of volume</italic> and concave margins.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A lung tumour may become cavitated, and uncommonly is mineralized, although no correlation between radiographic pattern and histological type of disease has been found.</p></list-item>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Abscesses:</title>
<p>A pulmonary abscess typically has a thick wall with an irregular inner surface. It may be cavitary, if it contains gas, either due to gas-producing bacteria or due to connection with the airways (Figure 12.45). It may be surrounded by abnormal, consolidated lung, or may be well demarcated and surrounded by normal lung. Horizontal beam radiographs may demonstrate a fluid&#x2013;gas interface. It is not commonly associated with pleural effusion.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Granulomas:</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Nodules/confluent nodules/amorphous masses (see Figure 12.33).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Poorly defined margins when active, more sharply marginated when resolving.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Often in association with hilar and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 12.46) and with a bronchointerstitial pulmonary pattern.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May become cavitated (most common in <italic>Paragonimus</italic> fluke infection).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May become mineralized (especially histoplasmosis granulomas) (see Figure 12.33).</p></list-item>
<p>Foreign body granulomas differ from other granulomas in that there is an absence of hilar lymphadenopathy, and they are usually solitary and larger than most other granulomas. They may develop into an abscess, if secondarily infected.</p>
<p>Pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia (PIE) can manifest with single or multiple pulmonary nodule(s)/mass(es) (also known as eosinophilic granulomas), varying in size from 2 to over 10 cm, in addition to more commonly seen peribronchial changes. Tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy is not a consistent feature of this disorder (Figure 12.47).</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Haematomas:</title>
<p>While pulmonary haemorrhage often presents as patchy areas of interstitial or alveolar disease, a haematoma may also appear as a round to oval, well circumscribed soft tissue opacity, and may contain air. A haematoma is typically associated with lung contusions and pneumothorax, and is suspected based on a history of trauma. It can be differentiated from other masses with follow-up radiographs, which show a decrease in its size within several days.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<p>These are not often indicated. An oesophagram (Figure 12.48) can be helpful in differentiating a pulmonary mass from an oesophageal lesion or a hiatal hernia. Bronchography (Figure 12.49) can outline a mass effect, lobar location and relation of a mass to the bronchial system. Bronchography has been superseded by less invasive techniques (e.g. computed tomography, CT).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>A pulmonary mass is typically identified on thoracic radiographs. If there is not much aerated lung present between the mass and the thoracic wall, thoracic ultrasonography may be helpful to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Confirm pulmonary origin of an intrathoracic mass</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Differentiate between a soft tissue and a fluid-filled lesion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Perform ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration for cytology.</p></list-item>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Neoplasia:</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Typically appears as a round, hypoechoic mass but can have a variable appearance, depending on the presence of central necrosis, cavitations and trapped gas (Figure 12.50).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The deep margin of the mass is often smooth, in contrast with inflammatory lesions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It usually arises in the interstitium and displaces the surrounding lung tissue. As a result, no fluid-filled bronchi or normal branching vessels are seen within the mass. Inflammatory and infiltrative lesions may show fluid bronchograms and encroached vessels.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A sterile abscess as a complication of tumour necrosis is indistinguishable from a septic abscess.</p></list-item>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Abscesses:</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>An abscess usually appears as a mass with a cavitated centre and thick walls with irregular internal margins (Figure 12.51).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contents may be anechoic, hypoechoic or echogenic, and often move with gravity to the dependent side. Internal septations are possible.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May contain gas, in addition to the fluid, indicating communication with a bronchus or anaerobic infection.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When an abscess is suspected, an underlying foreign body should be considered. Most foreign bodies will create a clean acoustic shadow within the mass.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>CT is very helpful to confirm the pulmonary origin of a mass seen on radiographs and to determine accurately its extension and any involvement of the surrounding structures, especially when surgical resection is considered (see Figures 12.38b, 12.52 and 12.53). CT may be able to confirm the presence of a solid mass lesion which is not clearly evident on radiographs due to the superimposition of an adjacent alveolar infiltrate (representing secondary oedema, inflammation or tumour extension) on the mass. CT enables detection of smaller nodules than those identified radiographically and may reveal additional lesions, such as metastatic disease and lymphadenopathy.</p>
<p>CT can be very helpful to obtain a guided aspirate of a lesion, when the presence of aerated lung peripheral to the lesion prevents an ultrasound-guided biopsy (see Figure 3.7, p. 69). Pneumothorax and haemorrhage are common complications of this procedure, but they are rarely clinically evident or significant.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Magnetic resonance imaging</title>
<p>Very few publications describe lung mass magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in veterinary medicine. In human medicine, breath-hold techniques enable lung nodules of 5 mm to be detected. A three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo sequence with cardiac and respiratory gating is preferred for imaging lung parenchyma to minimize phase artefacts from cardiac motion (see Figure 4.4a, p. 73).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Metastatic lung disease</title>
<p>Radiography is the screening tool for metastatic lung disease in cases of known or suspected primary neoplasia anywhere in the body. Since radiography is such a simple, fast, non-invasive and inexpensive test, even screening of patients with a relatively low risk of neoplasia is still useful if other complex, time-consuming, invasive and expensive diagnostic tests or interventions are anticipated. Most pulmonary metastases manifest as lung nodules. These need to be differentiated from benign nodular lesions (granulomatous, incidental osteomas) and end-on vessels (see Nodular interstitial lung pattern and Solid pulmonary masses).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Thoracic radiography has a relatively low sensitivity to pulmonary metastases. A pulmonary soft tissue nodule must be 3&#x2013;5 mm in size to be visible. Nodules smaller than this may be visible if multiple nodules summate with each other, or if the nodule is mineralized. Pulmonary metastases rarely mineralize; however, a clearly visible nodule smaller than 3&#x2013;5 mm is most likely to represent an end-on vessel or an incidental mineralized nodule (heterotopic bone, granuloma).</p>
<p>Nodules are more detectable if surrounded by well inflated lucent lung, with maximal contrast between the lesion and the normal lung. Inspiratory, opposite lateral views are therefore essential, since on each view the lung on the dependent side is incompletely inflated, and metastases in that lung could be missed. It is not uncommon that nodules identified on one or both lateral films are not visible on VD/DV views. If a nodule is visible only on one view, this should not lead to dismissal of a lesion.</p>
<p>When a nodule is identified superimposed on the lung fields, an extrapulmonary location, such as the skin (mass, nipple, tick) or mediastinum, should be ruled out by evaluating an orthogonal view and by careful examination of the body wall of the patient. An extrapulmonary location should be suspected if a nodule or mass appears very opaque for its size. This is due to the increased contrast provided by the surrounding air outside the body. While identification of a nodule on two orthogonal views confirms the intrapulmonary location of a lesion with a high degree of certainty, it is often impossible to visualize a nodule on both views, even if real.</p>
<p>The most characteristic radiographic appearance of pulmonary metastatic disease is the presence of well defined soft tissue opacity nodules of variable size throughout the lung fields (see Figures 12.31 and 12.54).</p>
<p>Other manifestations of metastatic lung disease include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Ill defined nodules (particularly in cats) (Figure 12.55)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unstructured interstitial lung pattern (see Figure 12.34)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung consolidation (coalescing nodules, infiltrative lesions) (see Figure 12.31)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Miliary nodular pattern (a large number of small metastases of 2&#x2013;3 mm in diameter spread throughout the lungs) (see Figure 12.32).</p></list-item>
<p>Mesenchymal tumours, which spread primarily via the blood, tend to produce a low number of well defined metastases; whilst epithelial tumours, which spread primarily via the lymphatic system, often produce a large number of relatively small, ill defined nodules. However, this is only a general rule.</p>
<p>Radiographic patterns have been described for several tumour types:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Haemangiosarcoma: most commonly, poorly defined small coalescing nodules (Figure 12.56). Less commonly, well circumscribed nodules or an alveolar infiltrate secondary to haemorrhage may be seen</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Transitional cell carcinoma: most commonly, diffuse interstitial pattern or nodular interstitial pattern</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mammary gland neoplasia in dogs: well defined nodules/ill defined nodules/miliary nodules. Pulmonary alveolar septal metastases is a rare form of mammary tumour metastases described in dogs; the lungs are diffusely infiltrated by carcinoma, predominantly in the arteries and small capillaries of the alveolar septa. It results in a wide range of radiographic manifestations, but most commonly an unstructured interstitial pattern</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mammary gland neoplasia in cats: ill defined nodules/diffuse pulmonary pattern; less commonly, well defined nodules.</p></list-item>
<p>Contrast studies are not indicated.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>Similar to the findings described for pulmonary masses. It may be possible to image a peripheral metastatic nodule (Figure 12.57) and obtain an ultrasound-guided aspirate of the lesion.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>CT is the preferred imaging modality for pulmonary metastases in human medicine. It is more sensitive than radiography for the identification of pulmonary metastatic neoplasia. Nodules 3&#x2013;6 mm in size may be seen with standard techniques, and those as small as 1&#x2013;2 mm can be seen with high-resolution CT techniques (Figure 12.58; see also Figure 3.3, p. 67). CT also identifies a large number of nodules not seen with radiography.</p>
<p>Metastases are more commonly located in the peripheral lung, in a subpleural location, making these lesions more difficult to detect radiographically, but easier to distinguish from vessels on a CT image. Nodules can be distinguished from vessels by the fact that they are not continuous with a vascular structure on adjacent slices (see Figure 12.58c). CT is able to document unusual spread of metastatic disease, such as peribronchial infiltrate (Figure 12.61a), parenchymal bands of increased opacity, subpleural interstitial thickening, subpleural lines, irregular perfusion and ground-glass opacity (Figure 12.61b).</p>

<title>Bullae and blebs</title>
<p>Bullae are gross air accumulations within the lung parenchyma formed by the loss or breakdown of the alveolar walls. Bullae may also be known as pneumatoceles, and the two terms may be used interchangeably. Some authors and medical texts consider pneumatocele a specific term for a large pulmonary bulla. The bulla wall is created by connective lung tissue and visceral pleura, and this defines the bulla type (Figure 12.62). Pulmonary bullae can also be classified according to their origin as:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Congenital bullae: see Congenital lobar emphysema</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Traumatic bullae: the result of blunt thoracic trauma, causing a sudden rise in intrathoracic pressure. Air cannot be exhaled due to reflexive epiglottic closure (diving reflex), leading to lung laceration. Chronic lung diseases with frequent coughing can also weaken pulmonary parenchyma and lead to lung laceration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Idiopathic bullae: found in combination with spontaneous pneumothorax, without known cause of gas accumulation.</p></list-item>
<p>Blebs are intrapleural gas accumulations, which arise when air escapes the pulmonary parenchyma and gets trapped between the visceral and parietal layers of the pleura (Figure 12.63):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Often located at the lung apices</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Usually a sequel to parenchymal bullous disease of any origin</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>More difficult to detect radiographically</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>More prone to rupture and to create a pneumothorax.</p></list-item>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cysts</title>
<p>Pulmonary cystic lesions are fluid- or air-filled lesions surrounded by a thin wall of respiratory epithelium. The histological composition of the cyst wall determines the cyst type:</p>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Pulmonary cysts</italic> are formed from alveolar epithelium with no remnant of a bronchial wall on histopathology</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Bronchogenic cysts</italic> are dilated bronchioles or bronchi which have a bronchial wall remnant on histopathology.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cavitating lung lesions</title>
<p>These are defined as soft tissue masses with a fluid- or gas-filled centre. They may develop from an apparently solid nodule or mass, as the centre of the solid structure can liquefy due to a necrotic process. On occasions, a neoplasm may grow around a bronchus thus incorporating the bronchus into the mass; therefore, it is important to distinguish air within a bronchus within a mass from a cavitating lung lesion. Cavitating lung lesions are rare in cats and occur more commonly in dogs. The clinical signs vary with the underlying disease.</p>

<title>Gas-filled pulmonary lesions:</title>
<p>Gas-filled pulmonary lesions (i.e. blebs and bullae) are best visualized if surrounded by opaque lung tissue, which is best achieved with:

<title>Pulmonary emphysema</title>
<p>Pulmonary emphysema is characterized by an abnormal increase in the size of the alveolar air spaces due to destruction of the alveolar walls. It may be associated with bronchiolar obstruction with a valve mechanism (dynamic collapse):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Inspired air enters the pulmonary parenchyma but is unable to escape even with forced expiration (air trapping)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased expiratory intra-alveolar pressure leads to laceration of the alveolar walls and bulla formation.</p></list-item>
<p>It is usually confined to the lung periphery. Clinically manifesting lung emphysema is rare in dogs and cats. It is important not to confuse air trapping with forced inspiration or pneumothorax.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Congenital lobar emphysema</title>
<p>This is a rarely reported congenital bronchial cartilage abnormality or bronchial plug in puppies, leading to dynamic airway collapse and air trapping (see Figure 8.18b, p. 185). Usually only one lung or lobe is affected, but there may be tension collapse of other lobes. It has been reported in Shih Tzu, Jack Russell Terrier, Basset Hound and Pekingese puppies. Single bullous lesions without widespread emphysema can also be congenital in origin.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Acquired pulmonary emphysema</title>
<p>Obstructive bronchiolar disease (chronic bronchitis, feline asthma, bronchial neoplasia, bronchial foreign body) can lead to dynamic airway collapse and air trapping. Chronic compensatory hyperinflation has been reported to cause lobar emphysema. Mild changes are commonly seen in cats with asthma; marked changes are rarely seen in dogs or cats. Changes are usually bilateral.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Radiographs should be taken on both full inspiration and expiration. Emphysema is confirmed if there is no difference between inspiration and expiration in the position of the diaphragm or pulmonary radiolucency. A horizontal beam DV/VD view can be useful, as the dependent lung lobe does not collapse with lobar emphysema.</p>
<p>Signs of pulmonary hyperinflation on expiratory films (Figures 12.70 and 12.71) include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Hyperlucent, enlarged lung fields</p></list-item>

<title>Lung lobe torsion </title>
<p>Lung lobe torsion is an uncommon condition in small animals, but it is potentially life-threatening and requires surgical intervention in most cases.</p>
<p>Rotation of a lung lobe occurs around its axis, usually close to the hilus or rarely also in the middle of a lobe:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>This leads to twisting and occlusion of the bronchovascular structures</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Venous return and lymphatic drainage from the lung lobe are compromised, whereas arterial supply is preserved initially to some degree due to the stronger muscular arterial walls</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This leads to venous congestion, pulmonary oedema, sequestration of blood within the twisted lung lobe and eventually lung lobe necrosis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blood and fluid enter the alveoli and distal bronchi. </p></list-item>
<p>Air can be trapped within the twisted lung lobe due to incomplete bronchial obstruction with a one-way valve effect. Pulmonary emphysema can develop as a consequence of increased alveolar pressure, alveolar or bronchial tears; pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can result from bronchial tears.</p>
<p>Decreased lymphatic drainage, as well as increased interstitial and hydrostatic pressure within the affected lung lobe, leads to production of pleural effusion.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The effusion initially presents as a transudate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It later becomes haemorrhagic or suppurative. </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Necrosis or fibrosis in the later stages of the disease lead to a decrease in lung lobe volume. </p></list-item>
<p>Large-breed dogs with deep and narrow chests, particularly Afghan hounds, are predisposed. Small chondrodystrophic dogs with round chests, such as Pugs, have also been described with spontaneous lung lobe torsion. Small dogs and cats are more commonly reported to have an underlying condition, leading to the lung lobe torsion.</p>
<p>Underlying diseases are characterized by collapse of a lung lobe, which is also suspended in either pleural fluid or air, leading to increased lung lobe mobility. Pleural effusion, pneumothorax, trauma with compression of the thoracic cavity and partial collapse of a lung lobe, but also pneumonia and surgical manipulation, are described as predisposing conditions.</p>
<p>The most commonly affected lung lobes are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Right middle lung lobe (most common in deep-chested dogs)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Left cranial lung lobe, the entire lobe or the cranial part (most common in small, chondrodystrophic breeds).</p></list-item>
<p>All other lung lobes can be affected, and more than one lung lobe can be affected. Mid-lobar torsions are possible. Recurring lung lobe torsion has been described, but is unusual.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>Pleural effusion is a consistent finding in patients with lung lobe torsion. The pleural effusion can be:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Bilaterally symmetrical</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Asymmetrical</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unilateral and centred around the affected lung lobe (Figure 12.73). </p></list-item>
<p>In most cases pleural effusion is the consequence rather than the cause of the lung lobe torsion, and therefore it may be absent very early on in the disease process. However, this very early stage is rarely observed.</p>
<p>A mediastinal shift with displacement of the cardiac silhouette is sometimes present, usually away from the affected lung lobe, but can be towards a lung lobe with chronic torsion. The trachea can be dorsally deviated or have some degree of axial rotation at the level of the carina, caused by the abnormal position of the twisted lung lobe. This is best seen on a lateral radiograph (Figure 12.74).</p>
<p>Consolidation of the affected lung lobe is evident as an alveolar pattern with loss of visibility of the pulmonary vasculature; whereas, the unaffected lung lobes are relatively normal.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The affected lobe is enlarged and has rounded borders due to congestion. </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small air bronchograms or scattered gas lucencies throughout the affected lung lobe (air alveolograms, vesicular gas pattern) result in a foamy appearance of the lung. </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gas bubbles can also be gathered in &#x2018;clusters&#x2019; (Figure 12.75). </p></list-item>
<p>Less commonly, the lung lobe is uniformly opacified without evidence of air bronchograms, as air bronchograms usually disappear after a few days, when the air is replaced by blood or fluid. In chronic cases there is a loss of volume in the twisted lung lobe.</p>
<p>The lobar bronchus to the affected lung lobe is visible only over a short distance and is blunted, narrowed or ends abruptly close to the carina.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Air-filled bronchi running in an abnormal direction (inverted air bronchograms) indicate an abnormal position of a lung lobe (see Figure 12.73b). </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vessels in an abnormal position are rarely observed due to the consolidation of the lung lobe. </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The adjacent aerated lung lobes are displaced towards the centre of the thorax, evident by a change in direction of the blood vessels and bronchi, as well as the pleural fissure lines. </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rupture of a bronchus can lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. </p></list-item>
<p>The change in shape or orientation of the affected lung lobe is best seen after removal of the pleural fluid. In the presence of large amounts of pleural effusion, radiographs should be repeated after drainage of the pleural fluid. In addition, horizontal beam radiographs can provide valuable information by shifting the pleural fluid.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</title>
<p>Positive-contrast bronchograms using barium sulphate have been used to demonstrate the obstructed bronchus. This procedure has been superseded by other imaging modalities and is now obsolete (e.g. ultrasonography and CT).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>This can be helpful in patients with inconclusive radiographic findings and may give additional information about the presence of a lung lobe torsion and/or underlying disease. Ultrasonography can be performed in the non-sedated patient in a standing position or in sternal recumbency, which is tolerated even by dyspnoeic patients.</p>
<p>Ultrasonographic findings include (Figure 12.76):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pleural effusion, particularly around the twisted and congested lung lobe. The pleural fluid can be anechoic to cellular, depending on the haemorrhagic component of the fluid</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Enlarged, consolidated lung lobe, which is either hypoechoic or isoechoic to parenchymatous tissues such as the liver (&#x2018;hepatization&#x2019;) with rounded borders</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In chronic torsions, the lung lobe may be smaller and retracted towards the hilus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Foci of gas trapped within the pulmonary parenchyma recognized as hyperechoic foci with reverberation artefacts. If a large amount of gas is trapped within the twisted lung lobe, the whole lobe is hyperechoic with many reverberation artefacts</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Linear hypoechoic structures without blood flow and with a hyperechoic wall, representing fluid-filled bronchi (fluid bronchograms)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Abnormal course or shape of fluid bronchograms</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Abnormal position of the affected lung lobe, dorsal to the base of the heart, with the tip pointing up, or pointing cranially.</p></list-item>
<p>Care should be taken to assess the thoracic cavity and especially the cranial mediastinum for associated problems, such as mediastinal lymphadenopathy or other mediastinal masses, which are obscured radiographically by the pleural effusion but may be an underlying problem, leading to the pleural effusion and consequent lung lobe torsion.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>examination:&#x2002;Doppler</title>
<p>Doppler (colour or power Doppler) examination can be very helpful to determine whether a consolidated lung lobe is twisted, or if it is filled with fluid or cellular infiltrates (pneumonia, neoplasia). In a lung lobe torsion, typical Doppler findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Absence of venous blood flow</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Absence of, or reduced, arterial blood flow.</p></list-item>
<p>However, Doppler examination is hampered by artefacts produced by the motion of the lung lobe in the pleural effusion, due to the usually increased respiratory rate.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>This is the diagnostic method of choice, other than exploratory thoracotomy, for patients with unclear or inconclusive radiographic and ultrasonographic findings. It requires general anaesthesia, but is diagnostic in almost all cases of lung lobe torsion, and in addition allows screening for underlying diseases, such as lung or cranial mediastinal masses.</p>
<p>CT findings (Figure 12.77) are similar to radiographic findings; however, the position and patency of each bronchus can be better assessed:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>All bronchi should be followed from the carina into their respective lung lobes. This is best achieved on images reformatted in various planes, according to the position of the bronchus to be evaluated. The bronchus to a twisted lung lobe is blunted, ends abruptly or is narrowed considerably and changes its direction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In animals with chronic pleural effusion, it can be very difficult to differentiate a collapsed lung lobe from a twisted lung lobe, since both will have lost volume and collapsed lung lobes are also slightly dorsally rotated in the presence of large amounts of pleural effusion. It is helpful in these cases to scan the patient in dorsal and ventral or lateral recumbency to direct the pleural effusion away from the lung lobe. After ventilating the lungs for a few minutes, the lung lobe should be reassessed for degree of reinflation, position and shape of the bronchus. Failure to inflate in the non-dependent position is a sign of lung lobe torsion or other bronchial obstruction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An abnormal course of pulmonary vessels can also be seen; this is best visualized after intravenous administration of an iodinated contrast medium.</p></list-item>

<title>Lung herniation</title>
<p><italic>Mediastinal lung herniation</italic> (a mediastinal shift caused by the lung) is commonly seen in dogs and cats with lung masses and unilateral hyperinflation or emphysematous changes. Affected lung lobes protrude into the contralateral hemithorax and deviate the mediastinal structures and heart away from midline. It is usually reversible if the increased lung volume can be reduced. In patients with lung removal or lobectomy or lung collapse, the remaining lung tissue will also occupy the vacant space in the contralateral hemithorax.</p>
<p><italic>Cervical</italic> or<italic> thoracic wall herniation</italic> of the lung lobes is very rarely seen in dogs and cats. It can occur due to interruption of the thoracic boundaries with sudden intrathoracic pressure changes, as a consequence of trauma and chronic coughing.</p>

<title>Predominantly alveolar lung diseases and pneumonias</title>
<p>The term alveolar disease in this chapter is used for diseases in which an alveolar radiographic pattern is a predominant feature (see Alveolar lung pattern). Some types of pneumonia that do not produce a predominantly alveolar pattern are also included in this section.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of specific alveolar lung diseases is challenging because:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Most alveolar diseases also affect other components of the lung, e.g. the interstitium and bronchi. Very few diseases affect only the alveolar spaces (e.g. pulmonary alveolar proteinosis)</p></list-item>

<title>Atelectasis</title>
<p>The Greek word &#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x00ED;&#x03B1; means non-expansion of a terminal space. As a medical term, atelectasis is defined as an acute or chronic collapse or airless state of the whole lung or parts of it, caused by congenital or acquired conditions. This broad definition is synonymous with collapse and both terms are used in this manual in this sense.</p>
<p>In the normal lung, surfactant maintains lung compliance and alveolar stability. The negative pleural pressure and surfactant prevent elastic recoil and lung lobe collapse. If either of these is missing then the lung may collapse. There are different types of atelectasis:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Passive atelectasis (Figure 12.83 and 12.84):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Occurs if extra-alveolar pressure moderately increases</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Condition is non-obstructive &#x2013; if pressure normalizes, reinflation is possible</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mild to moderate loss of volume and recoil</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A common form is hypostatic collapse &#x2013; the dependent lung portion collapses under the weight of the non-dependent structures (particularly the heart) if the full lung capacity is not used. This is a physiological process</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Examples include mild pleural effusion or pneumothorax and prolonged unchanged recumbency (especially if anaesthetized).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compression atelectasis (Figure 12.85):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Occurs if extra-alveolar pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Condition is non-obstructive &#x2013; if pressure normalizes, reinflation is possible</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Considerable loss of lung volume beyond recoil</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Examples include tension pneumothorax, large pleural effusion and large thoracic masses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Resorption atelectasis (Figure 12.86 and 12.87):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Occurs if gas enters the alveoli at a slower rate than it is removed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May be either obstructive or non-obstructive</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Non-obstructive form &#x2013; oxygen replaces nitrogen as the predominant alveolar gas. Oxygen diffuses more readily into the bloodstream, leading to a reduction in alveolar volume. This is a physiological process</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obstructive form &#x2013; resorption of alveolar gas following total bronchial obstruction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Examples include supplemented oxygen inhalation (non-obstructive), bronchial foreign bodies, masses and plugs (obstructive).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adhesive atelectasis:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Occurs due to lack or destruction of surfactant. Surfactant normally diminishes surface tension allowing alveoli to inflate</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Condition is non-obstructive &#x2013; major airways remain patent</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Examples include congenital atelectasis, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cicatrization atelectasis (Figure 12.88):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Occurs if fibrosis and scar formation of lung tissue reduces lung compliance</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Condition is non-obstructive &#x2013; major airways remain patent</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Examples include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic pneumonia and adhesive pleuritis.</p></list-item>
<p>The location and degree of lung collapse depend on many factors, including:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pleural surface area:lung volume ratio: lobes or lung areas with a relatively large surface area and small volume have a higher tendency to collapse, e.g. right middle lobe and lobe apices</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collateral ventilation: a term used to describe aeration of the alveoli other than by direct airway connections. This is a major factor in preventing lobar collapse and allowing pulmonary reinflation after pneumonia. It also explains why a lobe may not collapse distal to a complete bronchial obstruction. Gas exchange occurs between lung segments via small pores and channels and airway anastomoses. A check-valve effect of pores of Kohn allows reinflation of collapsed lung areas during inspiration and prevents air escape during expiration. Collateral ventilation also promotes spread of infection throughout a lobe. Collateral ventilation is particularly effective with large pressure differences, e.g. during coughing</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is ineffective with: small pressure differences; pulmonary exudates and secretions obliterating pores and alveoli; and a high pleural surface:lung volume ratio</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gravitational effects: dependent lung areas always have a higher tendency to collapse. Non-physiological recumbency during medical procedures can put additional weight on the dependent lungs and promote collapse. Heart and mediastinal structures can exert pressure on the lungs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tidal volume: reduced activity, particularly under sedation/anaesthesia and during prolonged medical procedures, reduces the air space volume needed and promotes collapse</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inhaled gases: oxygen supplementation promotes resorption atelectasis.</p></list-item>

Ultrasonography is, therefore, a good method for further investigation of lung that is radiographically collapsed or consolidated. Induction of hypostatic lung collapse is also useful to further investigate or allow ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of a soft tissue lung lesion in the proximity of the lung margin.</p>
<p>The animal should be positioned with the affected lung in a dependent position for several minutes prior to scanning. The patient should be scanned before reinflation occurs, either from underneath the table (echocardiology table helpful) or immediately after turning the animal over so that the affected side is upper most.</p>
<p>Ultrasonographic findings include (see Figures 2.6 and 2.8, p. 22):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Highly echogenic lung tissue</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dispersed residual gas pockets</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Usually no fluid bronchograms</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reduced volume of the affected lobe</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sharp pointed or triangular margins are retained</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gradual increase in reverberation in non-dependent position with physiological collapse; this does not occur with pathophysiological collapse, consolidation or mass.</p></list-item>

<title>Relevance of atelectasis in the diagnostic imaging work-up:</title>
<p>Atelectasis is a very common phenomenon, which can occur within minutes of animal positioning during diagnostic imaging procedures. It is useful to be able to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Differentiate atelectasis from non-atelectatic alveolar lung diseases. The lobar shape and position, mediastinal and diaphragmatic shift should be evaluated. Lung volume is reduced in atelectasis, and normal or increased in non-collapsing alveolar diseases</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Differentiate between physiological and pathophysiological forms of atelectasis:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Progression and resolution of collapse: rapid onset and resolution in physiological collapse; chronic, non-reversible collapse in pathological forms of atelectasis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gravitational effects. Radiographs in opposite recumbency and/or with manual inflation should be obtained and assessed. Pathological collapse does not resolve in non dependent position or inflated state</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tidal volume and inhaled gases. The patient should be assessed/reassessed without general anaesthesia, sedation, prolonged recumbency or oxygen supplementation, which all promote physiological atelectasis.</p></list-item>

<title>Pulmonary oedema</title>
<p>Pulmonary oedema is defined as a pathological extravascular fluid accumulation in the lungs, originating from the pulmonary vessels. Direct aspiration is treated as a separate entity in this manual. Oedema develops if interstitial fluid production exceeds the capacity of the pulmonary lymphatic drainage. Increased fluid accumulates initially within the interstitium and then extends into the alveolar spaces. There are four main mechanisms for its development:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Permeability oedema:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased vascular permeability due to alveolar/capillary wall damage</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>High protein content of oedema fluid</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Normal vascular pressure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hydrostatic oedema:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased microvascular pressure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Low protein content of oedema fluid</p></list-item>

<p><BL3></BL2><BL2>&#x2013;	Anuric renal failure</p></list-item>
<p><BL3></BL2>&#x2013;	Excessive intravenous fluid therapy (hyperhydration). Commonly seen in cats.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reduced capillary plasma oncotic pressure:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Due to severe hypoalbuminaemia (&#x003C;10 g/l)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Low protein content of oedema fluid</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rarely leads to pulmonary oedema in dogs and cats</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contributing factor with intravenous fluid therapy (haemodilution).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reduced lymphatic drainage: most likely to be due to neoplasia; rarely leads to pulmonary oedema in dogs and cats.</p></list-item>
<p>In most diseases there is a combination of mechanisms, with permeability and hydrostatic oedema as the most important factors (<italic>mixed oedema</italic>). Because of the clinical implications, pulmonary oedema is often classified as <italic>cardiogenic</italic> or <italic>non-cardiogenic.</italic></p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (congestive heart failure):</title>
<p>Primarily hydrostatic oedema is seen. It is one of the pathological processes in left-sided heart failure. It occurs primarily as a result of increased vascular pressure due to backward left heart failure:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>With mitral regurgitation there is an increased volume of blood within the left ventricle and left atrium</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Elevated left atrial pressure causes increased pressure within the pulmonary veins</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This results in increased interstitial fluid production, which, if lymphatic drainage capacity is exceeded, leads to pulmonary oedema.</p></list-item>
<p>Aetiology includes:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Mitral valve disease. Most common cause in small-breed dogs (myxomatous mitral valve degeneration)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cardiomyopathies. Common cause in large-breed dogs (dilated cardiomyopathy) and most common cause in cats (all forms)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Left-to-right shunts (patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>High-output states (hyperthyroidism, anaemia, etc.) (rare).</p></list-item>
<p>Cardiovascular diseases causing pressure overload (aortic stenosis, systemic hypertension) do not commonly induce left-sided heart failure.</p>

<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Findings with untreated hydrostatic pulmonary oedema (Figure 12.89; see also Figures 12.17, 12.21 and 12.81e) include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Initially an unstructured interstitial pattern, progressing to an alveolar pattern</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pulmonary vascular distension, particularly venous (not consistently seen)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Left-sided cardiomegaly common in cardiogenic oedema</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Normal heart size in hyperhydration, some left heart diseases (bacterial endocarditis, chordae tendinae rupture, myocarditis), and traumatic chordae tendinae rupture and mitral valve prolapse (see Figure 12.21)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Distended stomach from aerophagia if very dyspnoeic</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Right caudal lobe may be more severely affected than other lobes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Individual lung lobes may be affected if their pulmonary vein is obstructed (e.g. with some cases of cor triatrium sinister and anomalous pulmonary venous drainage)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Oedema is labile and may change distribution within the lungs with alteration in the animal&#x2019;s position.</p></list-item>
<p>Cardiogenic or hyperhydration-induced pulmonary oedema responds within a few hours to diuretic treatment (see Figures 12.81ef). Imaging findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pulmonary vessels return to a normal size</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Resolution of the alveolar pattern</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Disappearance of the interstitial pattern, a sign of complete oedema resolution.</p></list-item>
<p>Resolution of lung opacity does not always correlate well with normalization of vascular size. The administration of a diuretic, such as furosemide, may reduce pulmonary venous size before lung pattern resolution occurs.</p>

<title>Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema:</title>
<p>This is primarily a permeability oedema. It is uncommon in dogs and rare in cats. There are three main aetiological subtypes:

<list-item><p>Electric cord bite injury, causing electrocution; most commonly seen in young dogs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pulmonary oedema secondary to decreased interstitial tissue pressure (Figure 12.91):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rare sequel to laryngeal paralysis or other forms of laryngeal obstruction or compression. Bulldogs over-represented due to the high incidence of upper airway disease</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Re-expansion pulmonary oedema is a rare sequel to rapid pleural draining of fluid or air. Occurs within 1&#x2013;2 hours of re-expansion and resolves over a few days.</p></list-item>

<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Other imaging techniques:</title>
<p>Head CT or MRI may be useful in patients with neurological signs:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>MRI has superior soft tissue contrast (seizures, suspected mass)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CT is superior for imaging head trauma (free gas, bone or metal fragments)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Head CT is quicker than MRI and may be easier to accomplish with sedation only, in patients where general anaesthesia is contraindicated.</p></list-item>
<p>Respiratory CT may be used to differentiate pulmonary oedema from other alveolar diseases and identify upper airway obstructions. Laryngotracheal ultrasonography allows assessment of the upper airways. This technique does not require sedation or anaesthesia. It may show laryngeal paralysis or laryngeal masses/swelling; it is particularly useful in cases of laryngeal masses in cats and allows guided biopsy.

<title>Smoke inhalation</title>
<p>This diagnosis is based upon a history of exposure to fire or smoke (Figure 12.95). There is no breed, age or sex predisposition. There is a seasonal bias, with an increased incidence in the winter months. Smoke inhalation results in a variety of pulmonary abnormalities:
<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>There may be no radiographic abnormalities (in approximately 25&#x0025; of reported cases). Radiographic changes (Figure 12.96) may not appear until 16&#x2013;24 hours after the insult. A reduced luminal gas column is seen with laryngeal oedema.</p>
<p>In dogs, radiographic findings have a random distribution; an alveolar pattern is most common. In cats, there is a predilection for the cranial or middle lobes; there is usually a diffuse interstitial pattern or focal alveolar opacities.</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Acute respiratory distress syndrome</title>
<p>ARDS is a human term defined as acute fulminating respiratory failure, resulting from a variety of diseases, leading to diffuse lung injury. It may also be called adult respiratory distress syndrome or shock lung.</p>
<p>ARDS is considered to be a subgroup of non-cardiogenic oedema. It is part of the systemic inflammatory response, leading to increased vascular permeability, pulmonary hypertension and airway constriction and obstruction. Inciting factors may be pulmonary (e.g. smoke inhalation, bacterial pneumonia) or non-pulmonary (e.g. endotoxaemia, pancreatitis, trauma, paraquat and other toxicities, fat embolism) in origin.</p>
<p>Histologically, ARDS is characterized by alveolar inflammation, oedema, haemorrhage, necrosis with formation of hyaline membranes or vascular congestion in conjunction with type 2 alveolar cell proliferation or interstitial fibrosis.</p>
<p>Clinical signs are acute onset of severe and progressive respiratory distress; in some cases signs are associated with an underlying cause (e.g. vomiting, evidence of trauma, etc.). Progressive tachypnoea and dyspnoea are seen in most animals with altered lung sounds.</p>
<p>The most common reported underlying causes in dogs are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Bacterial pneumonia (which may be secondary to smoke inhalation or parasitic pneumonia)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sepsis and aspiration pneumonia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ventilator-acquired pneumonia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung lobe torsion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Non-pulmonary causes: gastric torsion, splenic torsion, trauma, laryngeal obstruction, pancreatitis, parvovirus infection, uraemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), snake venom, drug toxicity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hyperoxia due to high inspired oxygen concentration (may result in lung injury similar to ARDS).</p></list-item>
<p>ARDS is possibly more common in younger dogs; no sex predisposition has been reported. A familial form is suspected in young Dalmatians (&#x003C;1 year old), some of which also have renal aplasia or hydrocephalus.</p>

<title>Uraemic pneumonitis (uraemic pneumonopathy)</title>
<p>Histopathological changes are similar to those of ARDS, and uraemic pneumonitis may be considered part of this syndrome. The high protein content of the oedema fluid suggests permeability oedema due to toxic lung damage. Other factors also are likely to play a role, e.g. reduced oncotic pressure and cardiovascular effects.</p>

<title>Pulmonary vascular embolic events and lung infarction</title>
<p>Pulmonary arterial embolism can occur in dogs and cats due to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Thromboembolic disease</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Iatrogenic foreign material embolism and thrombosis, e.g. coil occlusion of a patent ductus arteriosus and accidentally dislodged coils into the pulmonary arteries, broken off intravascular catheter material</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Neoplastic vascular emboli</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>High heartworm burden or broken off parts during attempted extraction.</p></list-item>
<p>Pulmonary venous embolism is uncommon in dogs and cats. Infarction is an uncommon sequel to embolic disease because:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The lungs have an extensive collateral circulation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Occlusion of central vessels results in ischaemia rather than infarction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Infarcts typically occur in lung periphery.</p></list-item>
<p>Consequences of an infarction depend upon the size and the amount of lung affected:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Small numbers of emboli may cause no clinical or radiographic changes (e.g. transient fat emboli seen during total hip replacement surgery)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Large numbers of emboli can result in severe respiratory distress.</p></list-item>
<p>Infarction is reported more commonly in dogs than cats. Reported predisposing causes for infarction include amyloidosis, pancreatitis, immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia, hyperadrenocorticism, dirofilariasis, neoplasia (thromboembolism) and surgical intervention with bone marrow compression (fat embolism). Renal disease is the most commonly identified underlying cause. Clinical signs include acute onset dyspnoea. Septic emboli may lead to multiple abscessation or pneumonia. Neoplastic emboli may lead to atypical seeding of a metastatic tumour. For more information on pulmonary vascular embolic events and lung infarction, see Chapter 7.</p>

<p>Blunt internal thoracic trauma (barotrauma) is a relatively common cause of lung laceration in cats; for example, following iatrogenic manual or automated hyperinflation of lungs during anaesthesia. It can cause pneumomediastinum, pneumo- or haemothorax, but does not cause widespread contusion.</p>
<p>Perforating lung injuries are uncommon in dogs or cats:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>External: bite, gunshot, stab wound; iatrogenic laceration during fine-needle lung aspiration or biopsy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Internal: intubation injury, penetrating bronchial or oesophageal foreign body or instrument.</p></list-item>
<p>Perforating lung injuries can cause pneumomediastinum, pneumo- or haemothorax; there is usually a local area of pulmonary haemorrhage.</p>

<title>Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (pumice stone lung)</title>
<p>This is a rare condition with widespread mineralized concretion within the alveolar lumen reported in humans, dogs and other animals. It has never been reported in cats. Inflammatory changes may or may not be present. The aetiology is unknown.</p>
<p>Despite its marked radiographic manifestation at an early stage, the clinical onset is insidious and progression is very slow. Cardiorespiratory signs range from completely absent or harsh lung sounds to pulmonary insufficiency and cor pulmonale. The term &#x2018;pumice stone lung&#x2019; relates to the postmortem appearance of the lung, which is stone hard and requires a saw for sectioning.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>There is marked widespread micronodular mineralization in all lung lobes, tapering towards the lung periphery (Figure 12.107). There is slow progression of radiographic signs over time. Differential diagnoses should include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Incidental pulmonary osteomas and mineralized </p></list-item>

<title>Pneumonia</title>
<p>Pneumonia is defined as inflammation of the alveolar parenchyma. The term pneumonia has been used to describe acute and exudative inflammation, and pneumonitis is used to describe chronic proliferative lesions. Regardless of the aetiology, the clinical signs and radiographic features of pneumonia are often similar. In this chapter pneumonias are classified first according to the initial site of involvement and the spread of infection, which can be documented radiographically. The characteristic radiographic findings caused by specific pathological agents are discussed following this classification.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Bronchopneumonia &#x2013; originates at the bronchoalveolar junction. Often acute in onset and infectious in origin. Usually cranioventral in distribution and due to an aerogenous origin. Bacterial causes are most common, often secondary to other lung insult, and result in suppurative pneumonia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lobar pneumonia &#x2013; the entire lobe is affected; usually due to fulminating bronchopneumonia, less commonly due to a tracheobronchial foreign body.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interstitial pneumonia &#x2013; huge variety of causes and probably under-recognized. Predominantly interstitial pattern with viral infection and chronic inflammatory diseases.</p></list-item>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Non-specific canine bacterial pneumonia:</bold></italic> This is the most common cause of pneumonia and often develops as a secondary infection following primary lung insult (e.g. haemorrhage, viral infection). Bronchopneumonia is the most common pathology and is thought to be due to an aerogenous infection. The cranial and middle lung lobes are preferentially affected due to the inherent vulnerability of the bronchoalveolar junction and gravitational effects. In haematogenous infections, the caudal lung lobes may be more severely affected. Involvement of the entire lobe is often seen as extensive collateral ventilation allows rapid spread of infection (lobar pneumonia). Clinical signs are variable but often include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Soft cough with increased respiratory effort</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Anorexia and lethargy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pyrexia is variably present</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clinical signs of an underlying cause, e.g. regurgitation, dysphagia.</p></list-item>
<p>Animals with impaired immune systems or mucociliary clearance (e.g. ciliary dyskinesia) are predisposed. Irish Wolfhounds and brachycephalic dogs are also predisposed.</p>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>A three-view study is very useful to assess all lung areas and differentiate alveolar disease from collapse. The radiographs may be normal (or just have an interstitial pattern) in the early stages. Changes often start in the tip of the lobes. Findings include (see also Figures 11.15, p. 235, 11.16, p. 236 and 12.45):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Alveolar pattern, often affecting the entire lobe (lobar pneumonia) (Figures 12.108 and 12.109)</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Small volume of pleural fluid or pleural thickening in severe cases</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>After recovery, a mild bronchial pattern often remains</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Abscess formation with a cavitating lung lesion is occasionally seen</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If there is necrosis of the lung, may get spontaneous pneumothorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ciliary dyskinesia often results in bronchiectasis, and situs inversus may be seen (right-to-left transposition of thoracic and abdominal viscera).</p></list-item>

<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Other imaging techniques:</title>
<p>For ciliary dyskinesia other techniques include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Nasal radiography, CT and MRI to identify associated non-destructive rhinitis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Brain CT/MRI to demonstrate associated hydrocephalus in some cases</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Scintigraphy to demonstrate lack of mucociliary clearance (see Figure 11.17, p. 236).</p></list-item>
<p>For lung consolidation (and abscessation) thoracic ultrasonography may be used. Findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Homogenous, mid to low echogenic lung (see also Figure 12.51)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Often small areas of gas with reverberation artefacts</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The lung may be mildly, but not markedly, enlarged with rounded borders as seen with lung lobe torsion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Fluid bronchograms</italic> may be seen (Figure 12.111): branching anechoic fluid-filled bronchus. Doppler ultrasonography helps differentiate fluid bronchograms from blood vessels</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Abscesses may be identified.</p></list-item>
<p>Aspirates can be obtained for culture and sensitivity. It should be noted that consolidated lung may mimic the appearance of the liver, especially when large fluid bronchograms are present. Care should be taken not to misdiagnose liver herniation.</p>
<p>CT (high-resolution, contrast-enhanced) may be used for the diagnosis of lung abscessation, interstitial pneumonia and differentiation from other lung diseases (Figure 12.112).</p>

</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Aspiration and fistulous pneumonia:</title>
<p>This is caused by pulmonary intake of large particles or fluid. Aspiration of small quantities of oral contents is common and does not cause problems if there are normal respiratory defence mechanisms. Barium is commonly aspirated if orally fed for alimentary contrast studies; small to medium amounts are well tolerated by animals, but resorption by tributary lymph nodes can take months to years. See Lipid pneumonia (below) for details about oil or milk aspiration.</p>
<p>With defective mucociliary clearance, immunodeficiency or aspiration of large quantities of infective material, aspiration pneumonia may develop. Gastric contents cause chemical damage to the airways and resultant airway constriction and oedema. This may be followed by secondary bacterial infection and development of ARDS. Airway obstruction or constriction may occur.</p>
<p>Aspiration usually affects the cranial and ventral aspect of the lungs, unless the animal aspirated whilst anaesthetized or recumbent when any part of the lung may be affected. Aspiration is common with any condition causing megaoesophagus and dysphagia, and is most commonly seen in the right middle lobe. Clinical signs include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Acute dyspnoea within 2 hours of aspiration; may be longer if particulate material, e.g. food</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Coughing, tachypnoea, wheezing and cyanosis.</p></list-item>
<p>Chronic tracheobronchial foreign bodies may lead to lobar pneumonia, due to occlusion of the bronchus and secondary bacterial infection (see Chapter 11):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Caudal and middle lobes are most commonly affected</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Grass awns are the commonest inhaled foreign body in dogs, usually in summer/autumn</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Large-breed and working dogs predisposed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clinical signs of acute onset coughing after running in vegetation.</p></list-item>
<p>Broncho-oesophageal or bronchogastric fistulae are rare causes of pneumonia and are usually traumatic in origin (secondary to foreign body) but may be congenital. Clinical signs are of recurrent pneumonia and often associated with eating.</p>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Radiographs are normal in the initial stages but develop abnormalities within 12&#x2013;36 hours. In cases of particulate aspiration, radiographic changes may take longer to appear and disappear. The dependent lung at the time of aspiration is predominantly affected. Cranioventral parts of the cranial and middle lobes are most commonly affected, often with lobar opacification (Figure 12.114). Signs of the underlying condition may be seen, especially with oesophageal disease.</p>
<p>A combination of aspiration pneumonia, megaoesophagus and cranial mediastinal mass are commonly seen in thymoma and may be reversible if the tumour can be treated successfully.</p>

</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pulmonary neoplasia</title>
<p>Neoplastic causes of the alveolar pattern may be due to extension of the tumour into the alveoli, bronchial obstruction or inflammatory reaction to the tumour. An alveolar pattern may be seen with both primary and, less commonly, secondary pulmonary neoplasia.</p>
<p>Neoplastic alveolar disease is chronic and does not resolve with standard antimicrobial treatment (see Figure 12.81cd). The lack of short-term temporal evolution helps differentiate it from the more common acute alveolar diseases.</p>
<p>Primary lung tumours frequently cause lobar consolidation either due to obstruction of a bronchus or direct invasion of the lobe, but usually affect single lobes. Air bronchograms are uncommon, in contrast to acute alveolar disease, as the bronchi are often filled by tumour tissue or displaced by it. Lymphoma and some bronchoalveolar tumours grow around the airways, so may result in air bronchograms.</p>
<p>In cats, generalized or multifocal alveolar disease may be seen with primary and metastatic tumours. Neoplasia should be suspected if there is enlargement of an affected lobe, particularly in older animals.</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Predominantly interstitial lung diseases</title>
<p>The pulmonary interstitium consists of the subserosal lung capsule and a network of fibroblasts, collagen and elastic fibres covering the alveolar membranes, airways and vessels. Dogs and cats lack interstitial septae between the lung lobes. The interstitium has a trophic and immunoprotective function, provides a mechanical framework for the alveoli, airways and vessels, and is responsible for the elastic recoil of the lung. Diseases that affect the interstitium often change the pulmonary compliance (see Figure 12.15):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Destruction of the elastic fibre network results in an abnormally <italic>high</italic> compliance, e.g. emphysema, causing distended air spaces on inspiration and expiration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interstitial proliferation results in an abnormally <italic>low</italic> compliance, e.g. interstitial fibrosis, resulting in incompletely distended air spaces on inspiration.</p></list-item>
<p>The major types of pulmonary interstitial disease are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fluid accumulation causing interstitial oedema</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Infiltration with inflammatory or neoplastic cells</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chronic conditions causing collagen deposition, fibrosis and mineralization.</p></list-item>
<p>All of these conditions cause thickening of the alveolar walls and peribronchial tissues, which results in an overall increased opacity of the lungs and blurring of the fine vascular structures (see Interpretive principles, above). Primarily interstitial lung diseases may be localized or diffuse, with systemic diseases often associated with diffuse pulmonary involvement. Interstitial disease can progress to an alveolar pattern if the alveoli become fluid-filled, such as in acute interstitial pneumonia or secondary pneumonia, or if the alveolar walls become markedly thickened and the alveolar sac is compressed. However, identification of an interstitial pattern can help to determine the nature of the disease process. The interstitial pulmonary pattern is a common and often non-specific radiographic sign.</p>
<p>The interstitial pattern must first be differentiated from age-associated changes and physiological causes, such as hypoinflation and obesity. Once the pattern is determined to be significant, a list of differential diagnoses can be formulated. An interstitial pattern is a stage in many disease processes, and the temporal aspect has to be considered in the radiographic interpretation.</p>
<p>All of these remarks refer to the <italic>unstructured</italic> or<italic> fine-structured interstitial pattern.</italic> The nodular pattern, which is also a form of interstitial pattern, is discussed above (see Solid pulmonary masses).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interstitial oedema</title>
<p>Under normal conditions, there is fluid flux from the pulmonary capillaries through small gaps between the endothelial cells into the interstitium, and drainage from the interstitial space by lymphatic vessels (see also Pulmonary oedema, above). Increased interstitial fluid production (oedema) occurs due to one or more of the following:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Increased microvascular hydrostatic pressure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reduced capillary oncotic pressure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased vascular permeability</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reduced lymphatic drainage.</p></list-item>
<p>The pulmonary lymphatics can increase their drainage capacity 3&#x2013;10 fold in an acute situation to prevent oedema from occurring. If this flow is exceeded fluid starts to accumulate, initially in the interstitial tissues surrounding the vessels and lymphatics. The largest amount of fluid tends to gather around the pulmonary arteries.</p>
<p>The interstitial space can expand up to twice its normal volume. When the pressure in the expanded interstitial space rises to a similar pressure to the alveolar interstitium, forward flow decreases and the alveolar interstitium starts to expand, causing alveolar wall thickening. Eventually, the alveolar walls cannot withstand the pressure and gaps or ruptures form in the alveolar epithelium. Filling of the alveoli with fluid is the alveolar stage of pulmonary oedema.</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interstitial pneumonia</title>
<p>Interstitial pneumonia (see also above) is caused by infiltration of inflammatory cells into the alveolar walls (sparing the airways) or by toxic exposure. The original inflammatory or toxic insult may arise from the bloodstream or may be carried by aerosol, resulting in acute damage to the alveolar membranes. A number of different aetiologies (viral, bacterial, parasitic, fungal, toxic) may result in pneumonia manifesting as an interstitial pattern.</p>
<p>Interstitial pneumonias are divided into acute and chronic, with some degree of overlap, and may present at either stage:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Acute pneumonia is often caused by infectious agents and is self-limiting. It does not always cause a radiographic interstitial pattern</p></list-item>

<title>Interstitial fibrosis</title>
<p>Interstitial fibrosis is the end-stage of a variety of pulmonary diseases with irreversible alterations to the collagen-supporting structures of the interstitium. The original insult may be infectious, inflammatory or idiopathic in nature and often cannot be determined when the animal is presented. Acute infectious pneumonias and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema usually do not result in chronic fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis can occur focally, or secondarily to an abscess, infarction or trauma but this is usually insufficient to cause respiratory compromise. Consequences of pulmonary fibrosis are a decrease in functioning lung tissue, compliance and tidal volume.</p>

<title>Radiation-induced lung fibrosis:</title>
<p>Radiation damage to the lung from accidental exposure is rare. However, with radiation therapy for thoracic wall neoplasia and prolonged fluoroscopic and interventional procedures becoming more common, radiation damage to focal areas of the lung may be encountered.</p>
<p>Radiation damage depends on the dose and irradiated volume. Clinical signs are to be expected if more than 25&#x0025; of both lungs are exposed. The lung is one of the most sensitive tissues with late response to radiation:

<p>Dipyridylium derivates (paraquat, diquat, morfamquat) are used as desiccant and defoliant herbicides. Paraquat is one of the most commonly used herbicides worldwide and is highly toxic to animals and humans. It reacts with oxygen to form oxygen free radicals, which are extremely damaging to the lungs. Contamination is usually via oral ingestion, and vascular distribution with particular affinity to the lungs.

<title>Interstitial mineralization</title>
<p>Mineralization of the pulmonary parenchyma may be dystrophic, metastatic or idiopathic. Calcium and other minerals are concentrated in the mitochondria of the cell or in the vesicles in the extracellular space. Minerals are deposited as non-crystalline calcium phosphate (dystrophic), calcium carbonate salts (metastatic) or hydroxyapatite crystals (dystrophic and metastatic).</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Dystrophic mineralization:</bold></italic> This occurs with damaged or necrotic lung tissue in dogs with normal serum calcium, and with diseases of calcium metabolism, secondary to parasitic or fungal granulomas (histoplasmosis), abscessation, neoplasia or metabolic disease (hyperadrenocorticism). Diffuse inflammatory lesions that result in fibrosis, such as chronic uraemia, can also have a component of mineralization. Heterotopic bone (pulmonary osteoma) is considered a form of dystrophic mineralization. Small islands of bone matrix are deposited in the pulmonary parenchyma and mineralize. This is commonly seen in older dogs as an incidental finding. Bronchial walls commonly mineralize in dogs, but rarely do so in cats. Osteosarcomas occasionally form osteoid pulmonary metastases.</p>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing&#x2019;s disease):</title>
<p>This causes dystrophic mineralization of the soft tissues, including the skin, stomach, arteries, skeletal muscles and kidneys. Cortisol alters glucose production in the liver, and this has catabolic effects. Proteins formed in relation to these processes are altered, and may result in increased calcium binding to the organic matrix. The lungs are one of the most frequently mineralized tissues at the microscopic level; macroscopic radiographically evident mineralization is rare. Serum calcium levels are generally within normal limits.</p>
<p>If the degree of mineralization is severe, dogs may experience significant respiratory distress and be oxygen-dependent. This hypoxaemia may be due to impaired gas diffusion across the mineralized alveolar walls.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Metastatic mineralization:</title>
<p>This is caused by altered serum calcium and phosphorus levels with deposition of minerals in the normal tissues. Causes of hypercalcaemia include primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis D, lymphosarcoma, cholecalciferol rodenticide toxicity and disseminated bone cancer, such as multiple myeloma. Tumours (e.g. anal gland carcinomas) can also produce a parathormone-like hormone, which causes hypercalcaemia as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Most instances of metastatic mineralization in the lung are visible only at the microscopic level.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Idiopathic and iatrogenic mineralization:</title>
<p>This includes pulmonary alveolar and bronchiolar microlithiasis (idiopathic) and mineralization secondary to barium aspiration (iatrogenic).</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Interstitial lung mineralization can manifest as:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Normal appearing lung</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small nodular mineralization (heterotopic bone) (see Figure 12.33)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Central or peripheral mineralization of masses (see Figures 12.43 and 12.142a)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unstructured interstitial lung pattern with or without mineralized appearance (Figure 12.142b)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Diffuse marked mineralization (alveolar microlithiasis, barium resorption) (see Figures 12.107 and 12.114a).</p></list-item>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Hyperadrenocorticism:</title>
<p>Radiographic findings in dogs with Cushing&#x2019;s disease are often mild and can be partially caused by artefacts. The obesity of cushingoid dogs means that a high kV setting is required to obtain the radiographs; a high kV reduces image contrast (scatter, high penetration, Compton-related low image contrast). Low image contrast can mimic an interstitial lung pattern. Body condition should, therefore, be taken into account when diagnosing interstitial disease.</p>
<p>Common radiographic findings (see Figures 12.27 and 12.142b) include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Mineralization difficult to see radiographically and usually causes an unstructured interstitial pattern</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Marked bronchial mineralization, most pronounced in the caudodorsal lung fields due to an increased volume of lung in that area</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May progress to an alveolar pattern with air bronchograms</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interstitial pattern does not resolve with diuresis (as opposed to oedema).</p></list-item>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography:</title>
<p>CT is very sensitive to changes in density, and is more sensitive than radiographs at diagnosing pulmonary mineralization (see Figure 12.59). The Hounsfield units (HU) can be measured and compared with the normal values for soft tissue and mineral to determine the presence of mineralization. Soft tissue is usually 30&#x2013;60 HU, and mineralized tissue is greater. CT is also useful in patients with hyperadrenocorticism to identify pituitary or adrenal masses.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Scintigraphy:</title>
<p>Pulmonary mineralization can be diagnosed using nuclear scintigraphy. <sup>99m</sup>Technetium-methylene diphosphonate can be injected intravenously, as for a bone scan. At the 2-hour time point, the pulmonary parenchyma will show an increased uptake of radiopharmaceutical due to binding with the hydroxyapatite crystals in the interstitium, which are similar to those in bone (Figure 12.143). This may be a useful technique if the dog has a mild interstitial pattern and it is unclear whether it is due to pulmonary oedema or diffuse mineralization.</p>

<title>Radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>The pleural membrane consists of a single layer of flattened mesothelial cells that overlie a connective tissue layer containing blood vessels and lymphatics. There are two types of pleura: <italic>parietal</italic> and <italic>visceral</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>parietal</italic> pleura line the inner surface of the wall of the thorax and the diaphragm, enveloping the central thoracic structures including the heart, great vessels and oesophagus to form the mediastinum<italic><bold></bold></italic> (Figure 13.1). They can be divided into costal, diaphragmatic and mediastinal parietal pleura. The parietal pleura tend to curve slightly inward as they cross each rib and to curve slightly outward in the intercostal space. They form a closed cavity on each side that communicates with the contralateral pleural cavity via fenestrations in the mediastinum. These fenestrations are absent in some animals. The pleural space is not continuous with the mediastinum.</p>
<p>The <italic>visceral</italic> pleura cover the lung surface and form the interlobar fissures, merging at the hilus with the mediastinal pleura to form the pulmonary ligaments (Figure 13.1).</p>
<p>The parietal and visceral pleura are separated by the <italic>pleural space</italic>, which is a potential space of normally less than 1 mm in thickness. The pleural space contains a small quantity of fluid (approximately 2&#x2013;3 ml) as a lubricant to minimize friction during respiration. The surface tension of the pleural fluid holds the lung against the thoracic wall. Negative pressure within the pleural space keeps the lungs inflated against their natural tendency to collapse through elastic recoil, and allows the lung to remain partially expanded even after complete expiration. Negative pressure also plays an important role in maintaining expansion of the small airways, which are not supported by cartilage, during inspiration. There is a continuous high turnover of pleural fluid in normal and diseased states. In humans 5&#x2013;10 litres of fluid pass through the pleural space in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The parietal pleura are supplied by the systemic circulation via the intercostal and regional arteries; the visceral pleura are supplied and drained by the pulmonary circulation in the dog and cat, which results in an overall movement of pleural fluid between the parietal and visceral pleura. The lymphatic vessels of the visceral and diaphragmatic pleura drain the pleural cavity. The pleural fluid moves through the capillaries of the parietal pleura into the pleural space where it is absorbed by the capillaries of the visceral pleura and by lymphatics. Visceral pleural lymphatics play an important role in the circulation of pleural fluid. The lymphatics also provide the only means for proteins, red blood cells and particulate matter to return to the vascular system.</p>
<p>In the cat there is thought to be an anatomical variation in visceral pleural drainage that is incompletely understood. Conflicting information is reported in the literature. The clinical significance of this variation is in the tendency of some cats to develop pleural effusion secondary to left heart failure.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the pleura is too thin to be visible on the thoracic radiograph of a normal dog or cat. However, there are circumstances when the normal pleura may be seen as thin pleural lines:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Occasionally the X-ray beam traverses the patient exactly parallel to a pleural fissure and is absorbed sufficiently to create a visible line. This is radiographically indistinguishable from mild pleural thickening</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A sharp line is often seen on the left side of a ventrodorsal (VD) or dorsoventral (DV) view, running from near the apex of the heart to the diaphragm. This line has been (falsely) called the cardiophrenic ligament. It is actually a fold of mediastinal pleura lying between the accessory and left caudal lobes. A more correct radiographic descriptive term is the caudoventral mediastinal reflection (see Figure 8.5, p. 179)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Thickening or calcification of the pleura may occur in older animals, making those membranes that lie parallel to the X-ray beam visible radiographically.</p></list-item>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interpretive principles</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Increased or decreased opacity of the pleural space</title>
<p>The pleural space becomes radiographically visible only when distended with gas, fluid, fibrin or cellular material. When distended with fluid, fibrin or cellular material, it will be visible as an area of increased radiopacity. When distended with gas, the pleural space will be seen as an area of decreased opacity outlining the lung lobes (Figure 13.2). Pleural gas is differentiated from air-filled lung tissue by its lack of vascular or bronchial markings (an intensive light source may be required).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Elevation of the cardiac silhouette</title>
<p>Elevation of the cardiac silhouette from the sternum on the lateral radiograph is a common radiographic feature of pneumothorax in the dog and cat. It may also be seen with pleural effusion, particularly in the cat. The term is misleading as the cardiac silhouette is not really elevated, but rather falls away from the sternum. This phenomenon can be explained by loss of the air-filled lung supporting the heart in its normal anatomical position within the thorax (Figure 13.3). The heart moves towards the dependent side of the thorax, creating a gap between the cardiac apex and the sternum.</p>
<p>When air is present in the pleural space, the gap between the heart and the sternum is seen as a radiolucent (dark) area without lung markings (Figure 13.4a). This radiographic feature may not always be evident if an animal with a unilateral pneumothorax is positioned with the affected side uppermost.</p>
<p>When fluid is present in the pleural space, the gap between the heart and the sternum will be of soft tissue opacity. The cardiac silhouette will be obscured to a variable degree since the fluid surrounding it is of the same opacity. Therefore, elevation of the cardiac silhouette (&#x00B1; trachea) secondary to pleural effusion may give a false impression of cardiomegaly.</p>
<p>Other causes of apparent cardiac elevation on the lateral radiograph, which should be differentiated from pleural abnormalities, include mediastinal fat, hypovolaemia, pulmonary emphysema and overinflation.</p>

<title>Lung lobes and lobar margins in pleural disease</title>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Uniform lung lobe collapse</title>
<p>When air or fluid is introduced into the pleural space, the normal negative pressure is lost and so the lung lobes withdraw from the chest wall. The lung lobes have an inherent elasticity that causes them to collapse uniformly, retaining their shape (see Figures 13.4b and 12.83, p. 283). The narrower parts of the lung and the smaller lobes are more susceptible to the altered intrapleural pressure and therefore tend to collapse first. The right middle and left cranial lobes have a greater surface area to volume ratio and so are more compliant, i.e. more likely to collapse (see also Chapter 12).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Uneven or asymmetrical lung lobe collapse</title>
<p>This may be a sign of underlying pulmonary disease. For example, a contused or pneumonic lung lobe will tend to collapse more readily than a normally inflated lung. If the pleura become thickened or the lung loses its elasticity, the normal triangular shape of the lung lobes may be lost, giving a rounded appearance to their margin. This can also occur where a pleural effusion has been present for some time or where the nature of the effusion causes an inflammatory reaction in the underlying pleura or lung (see Figures 13.4cd and 12.88, p. 285). <italic>Rounding</italic> or <italic>scalloping</italic> of lobar margins is often a feature of so-called &#x2018;reactive&#x2019; effusions (e.g. pus or chyle). It may sometimes be seen in the absence of an effusion where chronic pleural scarring or fibrosis has developed, secondary to severe inflammatory lung disease. Sometimes this is a difficult distinction to make as an effusion may develop secondarily around a diseased lung lobe (see Chapter 12).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interlobar fissures and pleural lines</title>
<p>The division between two adjacent lung lobes is called an interlobar fissure. An interlobar fissure can be seen on a radiograph only under certain circumstances: it must be thickened or filled with fluid or other material, must contrast sharply with air (lung) on each side of it and must lie parallel to the X-ray beam. Fissures lying obliquely or <italic>&#x2018;en face&#x2019;</italic> to the X-ray beam do not attenuate the beam enough to be detected.</p>
<p>When two adjacent lobes are minimally separated at a fissure a <italic>pleural line</italic> is seen. These fine lines either curve towards the heart from the thoracic wall or radiate from the hilus. They are distinguished from other radiodense lines by their location, orientation and the absence of branching. Knowledge of the normal location of the interlobar fissures is helpful in identifying these pleural lines (Figure 13.5).</p>
<p>Larger amounts of pleural fluid more widely separate the lung lobes and highlight the interlobar fissures. These are seen as elongated wedges or triangular opacities, extending from the thoracic wall towards the hilus (Figure 13.6).</p>
<p>The pleural surface must create a sharp interface with air (lung) on each side of it, if it is to be seen. If pleural fluid borders one or two lung lobes with soft tissue opacity, there will be border obliteration between the lung and fluid, and neither of them can be distinguished. If a lung lobe of soft tissue opacity borders a normally aerated lung lobe, the interface between the lobes is highlighted and is called a <italic>lobar sign</italic> (see Figure 12.22, p. 252). This is a sign of alveolar lung disease and should be differentiated from a fissure line indicating pleural disease, where a line or band of soft tissue opacity is seen separating two aerated lung lobes.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pleural fluid and its distribution</title>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Free <italic>versus</italic> trapped or encapsulated fluid</title>
<p>Since fluid is denser than lung tissue, it always moves towards the dependent part of the thorax and the lung floats on top. The exception to this rule is fluid which is encapsulated, trapped or loculated, often as a result of an inflammatory process. Trapped fluid can be difficult to differentiate radiographically from extrapleural masses. Ultrasonographic assessment can be very helpful in such circumstances.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Patient position</title>
<p>The distribution of pleural fluid changes with patient position. With the animal in lateral recumbency, fluid tends to accumulate in the dorsal and ventral part of both hemithoraces, creating border obliteration with the heart and diaphragm and retraction of the ventral lung margins with interlobar fissures in the non-dependent lung (Figure 13.7).</p>
<p>With the animal in dorsal recumbency, fluid will tend to accumulate dorsally in the lumbodiaphragmatic recess and so the heart will usually be visible on the VD view, which can be of diagnostic importance. (It should be noted that there is an increased risk to the patient associated with dorsal recumbency, so this view should only be obtained if it is safe for the patient.) Small amounts of fluid in this location will not be seen radiographically due to the overlying heart, mediastinum, sternum and spine (Figure 13.8ab).</p>
<p>In ventral recumbency, the fluid will accumulate ventrally, surrounding the heart and obscuring it from view on the DV radiograph. The fluid level within the thorax is higher in ventral recumbency than in dorsal recumbency because the ventral part of the thorax is narrower. Thus, the opacity on the radiograph will be greater on the DV view (Figure 13.8cd).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Volume of effusion</title>
<p>The radiographic appearance of different volumes of pleural effusion are shown in Figures 13.9 and 13.10. The elasticity of the lung tissue is such that the smaller lobes and the thinner parts of the lung lobes are more likely to collapse under the pressure of fluid in the pleural cavity. Thus, the first place for fluid to be seen in the lateral view is usually along the sternum (Figure 13.9) where the thin ventral edges of the lung retract easily. In this position, a coating of fluid over the most dependent part of the lung causes only a slight increase in opacity and may be difficult to detect.</p>
<p>As the amount of effusion increases, retraction and separation of the lung lobes from the thoracic wall become evident in all views (Figure 13.10). With mild to moderate effusions, the amount of retraction of the lung lobes seen on the DV or VD view does not reflect the true extent of the pleural effusion. This is because the fluid accumulates with gravity beneath the lungs and only the fluid lying between the lung and the thoracic wall is struck tangentially by the X ray beam.</p>
<p>With massive amounts of pleural fluid the lung lobes are markedly retracted toward the hilus, and some intrapulmonary details are obscured by atelectasis (lung collapse) and the opacity of the fluid. The smaller cranial lobes and right middle lobe are the most severely affected and may disappear from view when they collapse, due to the overlying fluid opacity.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Unilateral <italic>versus</italic> bilateral</title>
<p>Most pleural effusions in dogs and cats are bilateral. Unilateral or uneven bilateral effusions can result from:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Closure of the mediastinal fenestrations, which can be congenital or secondary to a neoplastic or reactive effusion (e.g. pyothorax (Figure 13.11; see also Figure 14.15b, p. 349), chylothorax, haemothorax)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The presence of trapped or encapsulated fluid</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fluid accumulation adjacent to a collapsed lung lobe as a result of reduced intrapleural pressure.</p></list-item>
<p>Unilateral effusion is easiest to identify on VD and DV views. Large volumes may collapse the ipsilateral lung and displace the mediastinum towards the contralateral side. Unilateral effusions are more difficult to identify on lateral views. Increased soft tissue opacity dorsal to the sternum and retracted lung margins are only visible when the animal is positioned with the fluid in the non-dependent hemithorax. Fluid in the dependent hemithorax results in soft tissue opacity superimposed over the inflated upper lung, which may mimic a uniform pulmonary infiltrate.</p>
<p>Freely moveable bilateral effusion results in the lung on the dependent side always being more collapsed than the lung on the non-dependent side, as fluid moves across the mediastinum with repositioning.</p>
<p>Uneven bilateral effusion will produce asymmetrical changes on DV or VD views, reflecting the volume of fluid present in each hemithorax.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pseudoeffusion</title>
<p>Mediastinal fat can elevate the cardiac shadow, outline the ventral margins of the lung lobes and cause them to appear rounded on the lateral view, mimicking the presence of an effusion. This normal feature can be differentiated from an effusion since the cardiac shadow is not obscured by the fat opacity.</p>
<p>The ventral lung margins may be normally retracted from the sternum in dogs with deep narrow chests, mimicking the presence of a small-volume effusion. The chest conformation of certain breeds, notably the Dachshund, may mimic the presence of a small pleural effusion on a VD or DV view, due to the curvature of the ribs and costal cartilages (see Figure 14.24, p. 353).</p>
<p>In the cat, the lung fields do not extend to fill the angle between the spine and the diaphragm (the lumbodiaphragmatic recess) on a lateral radiograph, as they do in the dog. The presence of the psoas minor muscle in this region gives rise to a narrow triangle of soft tissue opacity between the caudal margin of the lung and the vertebral column, which should not be misinterpreted as pleural fluid (Figure 13.12; see also Figure 12.13, p. 248).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cranial mediastinal mass or pleural effusion?</title>
<p>Pleural effusion must be differentiated from thoracic masses, especially if elevation of the trachea and pulmonary hilus are present:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Small volumes of fluid are unable to deviate the trachea dorsally in the absence of a mass, and even large volumes are unable to compress or distort the trachea or displace the carina caudally</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With marked pleural effusion, the trachea can obtain an orientation which is straight but parallel to the spine (see Figure 10.32, p. 226). This should be considered if cardiac size is assessed solely on tracheal position</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The heart and trachea should move with gravity, so non-gravitational movement suggests the presence of a mass</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Horizontal beam radiography may be useful to visualize areas of the thorax concealed by fluid on standard views</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ultrasonography is extremely useful to differentiate between masses and effusion (see Chapter 8).</p></list-item>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Lung mass and pleural effusion</title>
<p>Many lung masses are accompanied by pleural effusion and it can be difficult at times to diagnose and characterize the mass in this situation. Decubitus or positional radiography can be helpful to separate the mass from small amounts of free pleural fluid (Figure 13.13). Ultrasonography is useful in these cases.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pleural gas and its distribution</title>
<p>Pleural gas rises to the highest point of the thorax; thus, it is commonly seen surrounding the caudal and caudodorsal lung lobe margins on DV and lateral views (see Figure 13.2). Small to moderate pneumothorax is often not visible in routine VD views since the air accumulates in the midline, where it is obscured by the overlying mediastinal structures. Special radiographic views may be necessary to identify small volumes of pleural gas (see below).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pseudopneumothorax</title>
<p>Conditions which may be mistaken for pneumothorax are summarized in Figure 13.14.</p>
<p>The most common of these is the presence of skin folds. On a DV or VD radiograph, folds of skin running parallel with the long axis of the patient may create a sharp air&#x2013;tissue interface, which is projected over the periphery of the lung field (Figure 13.15; see also Figure 14.8b, p. 345). These folds can be distinguished from a true pneumothorax as they can often be traced beyond the thoracic margins, a lung pattern is usually detectable within the radiolucent regions (using an intense light source), and the direction of the curvature of the lines is different from true interlobar fissures.</p>
<p>Conditions causing hyperlucency of the lung fields must also be differentiated from pneumothorax. These include emaciation, emphysema, overinflation associated with asthma or bronchial disease, and hypovascularity of the lung field due to hypovolaemia or conditions such as tetralogy of Fallot. Faint vascular markings will usually be seen extending up to the thoracic wall in these conditions, and there will be no thin line to mark the edge of a collapsed lung lobe. An intense light source may be required to identify the lung markings in overexposed areas.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Thoracic size and shape</title>
<p>In the presence of massive pleural effusion or tension pneumothorax, the thoracic width can be seen to increase markedly. The ribs and costal cartilages lie at right angles to the spine and the intercostal spaces are widened. The extent of these changes is often best appreciated when pre- and post-drainage films are compared. Also, the diaphragm can be flattened or even curved concavely (see Figure 14.14, p. 348).</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Special radiographic views for pleural disease</title>
<p>It is important to note that patient safety is paramount. Good quality radiographs may be difficult to obtain in dyspnoeic animals. Consideration should be given when positioning these animals to avoid precipitating a crisis. In particular, dorsal recumbency may be contraindicated in animals with large volume effusions or respiratory compromise. Drainage of an effusion or pneumothorax prior to radiography may therefore be advisable.</p>
<p>There are many techniques that can be employed to assess pleural disease better. These include altering patient position, beam angulation and making use of different respiratory phases. Radiation safety must be carefully considered when obtaining horizontal beam views or when holding a patient in different body positions.</p>
<p>Radiographic technique will often require adjustment where pleural disease is suspected. Exposure values based simply on measurements of patient thickness will result in underexposure in the presence of pleural effusion, and overexposure in patients with pneumothorax.</p>
</sec1>
<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diseases</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pleural effusion</title>
<p>Pleural effusion is the accumulation of any type of fluid in the pleural space. Small volumes may be tolerated without primary clinical signs, as may larger volumes if they have accumulated slowly. Cats may not demonstrate clinical signs unless stressed or near death. Clinical examination may reveal tachypnoea and dyspnoea. Large volume effusions may result in a barrel-shaped thorax, muffled or absent heart sounds, loss of a palpable apical beat, reduced respiratory sounds, especially ventrally, and dull sounds on percussion. Additional clinical findings will depend on the cause of the effusion.</p>
<p>Indications for radiography in animals with pleural effusion include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Confirmation of the presence of effusion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identification of small-volume effusions not revealed on clinical examination</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identification of the primary cause of the effusion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identification of fluid pocketing.</p></list-item>

<p>It should be noted that it is important to stabilize the patient before obtaining radiographs. This may include thoracocentesis.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Causes of effusion</title>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Hydrothorax:</title>
<p>This is the accumulation of aqueous fluids and is associated with the presence of a transudate or modified transudate. A <italic>true transudate</italic> results only from hypoproteinaemia (serum albumin below 15 g/l), secondary to protein-losing enteropathies and nephropathies, chronic hepatic disease or severe malnutrition. Even a true transudate causes pleural irritation and so will become modified with time.</p>
<p>A <italic>modified transudate</italic> is a transudate that becomes altered by the presence of non-inflammatory cells. This may result from:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Systemic hypertension, secondary to right-sided heart failure (see Chapter 7). Left-sided failure in dogs does not usually result in pleural effusion, unless there is concurrent right failure, when it will be accompanied by hepatic congestion and peritoneal effusion. In cats, pleural effusion is less common with right failure, but can occur with left failure due to variations in the visceral pleural drainage (see Radiographic anatomy above)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reduced pleural lymphatic or venous drainage (e.g. due to cranial mediastinal masses)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Protein leakage from chronic diaphragmatic hernias, especially with liver strangulation</p></list-item>

<title>Radiography</title>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>General pleural effusion:</bold></italic> Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Soft tissue opacity present within the pleural cavity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interlobar fissures visible in consistent locations on each view (see Figure 13.5)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung margins retract towards the hilus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Normal lung retracts evenly so fluid should be uniformly distributed, although dependent portions will collapse most</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In acute or non-reactive effusions the lung margins remain sharp (see Figures 13.4b and 13.16)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased opacity throughout the lung fields, secondary to compression and overlying effusion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Minimum volume identified radiographically is typically 50 ml in a small dog or cat and 100 ml in a medium-sized dog. Radiographs usually underestimate the volume present, as not all of the fluid is visualized in each view</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fluid types cannot be distinguished by opacity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fluid is indistinguishable from adjacent soft tissue masses, lung lesions, adhesions, etc.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Diaphragm can usually still be located by the presence of fat on the abdominal side, unless peritoneal effusion is also present.</p></list-item>
<p>The primary cause of the effusion (e.g. cardiac enlargement, mediastinal mass) should be sought. The VD view is often better than the DV view in cases of pleural effusion as it enables better visualization of the cardiac silhouette and cranial mediastinal masses. The DV view is always safer in a dyspnoeic patient and is better for assessing caudal lobar pulmonary vessels. Secondary changes (e.g. lung collapse, lung lobe torsion) should not be overlooked. Beware of anatomical or conformational differences that can mimic effusion (see Interpretive principles).</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Chronic or reactive pleural effusion:</title>
<p>Pleural thickening or pleuritis will result from chronic pleural effusion of any type, but will occur more rapidly in association with reactive (pyothorax, chylothorax, haemothorax) rather than non-reactive effusions. Reactive effusions may lead to the formation of fibrous adhesions and trapping or encapsulation of fluid (see below).</p>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Lung margins become irregular, rounded, undulating or scalloped (see Figures 13.4c and 13.17)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Uneven retraction of the lung lobes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung collapse with smaller lobes and peripheral portions of larger lobes being most susceptible</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Trapped</italic> fluid is restricted by fibrous adhesions; therefore, is unequally and abnormally distributed but moves with gravity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Encapsulated</italic> fluid is completely confined by fibrous material, so its position and shape remain constant and are no longer altered by gravity.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Thoracocentesis</title>
<p>Drainage may be indicated to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Relieve respiratory compromise</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obtain a fluid sample to aid identification of cause</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Allow radiographic assessment of intrathoracic structures previously obscured by fluid.</p></list-item>
<p>Radiography during drainage or lavage is indicated to assess drain placement. Drainage should be avoided or undertaken with care in animals with bleeding disorders or herniated abdominal contents. Radiography following drainage is useful to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Identify primary cause or secondary changes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identify incomplete drainage or fluid pocketing</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identify recurrence of effusion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identify restricted lung re-expansion, indicating the presence of adhesions.</p></list-item>
<p>Lung collapse resulting from the effusion may be identified immediately after drainage but should resolve, allowing differentiation from underlying lung disease.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Other radiographic techniques:</bold></italic> Other techniques may be useful to visualize areas concealed by the fluid on standard views and differentiate mobile fluid from static soft tissue masses, fibrous adhesions or non-mobile fluid accumulations:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Decubitus view (see Chapter 1) is the most reliable method for identifying small volumes (5&#x2013;50 ml in the dog) and assessing changes in volume over time</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Different patient positions will alter the distribution of fluid and may be useful to identify co-existing pathology:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dorsal recumbency with beam directed laterally will move fluid away from ventral areas</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Animal held upright and beam directed ventrodorsally moves fluid from cranial areas to identify cranial mediastinal lesions. It is important to consider safety implications associated with manual restraint</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is often sufficient to use a moderate table tilt to move free pleural fluid in desired locations (see Figure 13.13).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Negative- and positive-contrast pleurography have been used in the past to evaluate pleural lesions but have been superseded by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Standard radiographic lymphangiography may be used to evaluate the thoracic duct, although more recently, CT lymphangiography and MRI evaluation have also shown potential.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>Ultrasonography is useful to investigate the primary cause, e.g. assess cardiac function, evaluate pleural membranes, identify cranial mediastinal masses, diaphragmatic defects and lung lobe torsion. It is also useful for evaluating secondary changes, e.g. lung atelectasis, fibrin tags indicating chronicity, etc.</p>
<p>Ultrasonography can be used to locate small volumes or areas of trapped fluid, and to guide therapeutic drain placement or diagnostic fine-needle aspiration of the fluid. Multiple windows may be required to identify small volumes of effusion (it may be useful to scan from the dependent side). Large volumes may be found through most intercostal windows.</p>
<p>Pleural effusion greatly improves the ability of the ultrasonographer to visualize intrathoracic structures, such as mediastinal fat, vessels, lymph nodes, the oesophagus and occasionally the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Echogenicity of the effusion varies with the type; for example, exudates, haemorrhage and carcinomatosis are more likely to be echogenic (Figure 13.18).</p>
<p>Chronic effusions may lead to fibrin formation, seen as linear echogenic strands. Fluid in the pleural space of the cranial thorax is visualized as two discrete pockets separated by the mediastinum (Figure 13.19). This differs from cranial mediastinal fluid, where the mediastinum is widened and the mediastinal vessels are separated from fat by irregularly shaped fluid pockets.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>CT is useful to identify underlying or concomitant lesions, such as masses, lung lobe torsion or diaphragmatic defects. The patient&#x2019;s body position can be altered (sternal <italic>versus</italic> dorsal recumbency) during the scan to redistribute the fluid (taking care with patient safety).</p>
<p>Contrast medium administration and soft tissue algorithms are required for all studies. High-resolution lung algorithms may be useful to evaluate the pulmonary parenchyma. CT lymphangiography can be used for assessment of the thoracic duct and branches in animals with chylothorax.</p>

<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pleuritis, fibrosing pleuritis and pleural masses</title>
<p><italic>Pleuritis</italic> is inflammation of the pleura, resulting in thickening of the pleural membranes. In cats, the most common cause is FIP, where the non-effusive form causes a focal pyogranulomatous pleuritis. Pleuritis can also occur in dogs and cats due to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>An extension of lung disease (fibrinous bronchopneumonia, pleuropneumonia) or neoplasia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Irritation from material in the pleural space, including bile, pancreatic enzymes and asbestos-type material</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Systemic conditions, such as septicaemia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In association with a chronic pleural effusion of any type.</p></list-item>
<p>If the pleuritis leads to the production of an exudate (e.g. effusive FIP in cats, suppurative processes, neoplasia) then pleural effusion will result. Pleural thickening may also arise due to focal pleural haemorrhage associated with trauma. Pleural thickening may remain in animals even once causative factors have been removed.</p>
<p><italic>Fibrosing pleuritis</italic> refers to fibrous strand or adhesion formation between pleural surfaces and may occur in pyothorax, chylothorax, haemothorax, FIP and mycobacterial disease. &#x2018;Pleural peel&#x2019; is a thick fibrous layer produced by the organization of fibrin deposits in the pleural space. It can adhere to the pleura and extend into the lung parenchyma, reducing lung volume and restricting lung movement. It can even cause the affected area to adhere to the thoracic wall. Progression results in the lobes becoming enshrouded in fibrin, leading to chronic underinflation (see Figure 13.4d). The volume of fluid associated with fibrosing pleuritis may be small and trapped or encapsulated (Figure 13.20), although it can become severe and bilateral.</p>
<p><italic>Pleural masses</italic> can take the form of herniated abdominal viscera, granulomatous lesions, haematomas, pleural adhesions, pleural peel or neoplasia. Mesothelioma is the only primary neoplasm of the pleura. It does not present as a mass lesion but rather is disseminated and usually results in a large-volume pleural effusion. Diagnosis can be extremely challenging. Metastatic lung neoplasia (carcinoma) may also involve the pleura. Effusion is more commonly associated with pleural masses than lung or extrapleural masses (see also Chapter 14).</p>

<title>Radiography</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pleuritis results in thickening and irregularity of the pleura, producing linear opacities where tangential to the beam. This is best visualized at sites of interlobar fissures (see Figure 13.5) but if severe, may be observed around entire lung margin</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Differentiate from pleural thickening and calcification in older animals</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Differentiate from small-volume pleural effusion. (Horizontal beam radiography may differentiate mobile fluid from static pleural lines. Moderate fluid volume results in wedge rather than linear opacities)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The presence of adhesions may be suggested by tent- or U-shaped opacities</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Restricted areas of lung will be reduced in size, increased in opacity and will not inflate further despite repositioning animal</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May be minimal difference between the lung volume in inspiratory and expiratory views</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Following drainage, affected areas of lung may fail to re-expand and retain a rounded outline with a radiopaque margin, an appearance known as cortication. These areas may appear similar to hilar masses and must be differentiated from pulmonary neoplasia (primary or secondary), lung lobe torsion and hilar lymphadenopathy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intrapleural pressure around the lung lobes that remain collapsed will be reduced following drainage, therefore encouraging reformation of the effusion.</p></list-item>
<p>Pleural masses are usually associated with pleural effusion, so drainage is required for visualization but a mass may be suspected in the presence of:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Non-gravitational displacement of the cardiac shadow or other thoracic structures</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Uneven lung compression</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Soft tissue opacity not conforming to the linear or triangular shape of the pleural space (often spindle-shaped)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Soft tissue opacity that maintains its shape and position despite moving the patient, although this must be differentiated from trapped or encapsulated fluid.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>This is useful to confirm pleural thickening and can differentiate between parietal and visceral pleura involvement:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Mild pleural fibrosis appears as smooth thickening of the pleura</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the pleura are irregularly thickened or gnarly and echogenic, an inflammatory or neoplastic change should be considered</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pleural fluid is usually present in active pleuritis and in neoplastic disease</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Aspiration of fluid or a pleural mass may contribute to diagnosis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pleural masses may be identified (Figure 13.21)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It may be challenging to differentiate a pleural mass from a lung mass. A useful trick is to watch the motion of the mass with the animal&#x2019;s breathing. A lung mass will move with the lung; a pleural mass will remain stationary whilst the lung moves around it. Holding a dog&#x2019;s nostrils and mouth closed for a few seconds and then releasing may be useful to encourage the dog to take a deep inspiration, thereby enabling the motion of the lung and mass to be assessed. This should only be attempted if the animal is clinically stable.</p></list-item>

<title>Pneumothorax</title>
<p>Pneumothorax is the accumulation of gas within the pleural space and may develop in a variety of ways (Figure 13.22). Clinical signs of pneumothorax may be subtle or dramatic and progress from rapid shallow breathing to open-mouthed panting. If the air accumulates slowly, the early signs of respiratory difficulty may only be present on inspiration. Small amounts of pneumothorax are often difficult to detect clinically. Radiographic detection is valuable to pinpoint an underlying condition.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Types of pneumothorax</title>
<p>Pneumothorax may be generally classed as traumatic or spontaneous.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Traumatic:</title>
<p>This may be classed as open or closed:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Open: the chest wall has been breached. Gas from the external environment enters the pleural space</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Closed: the thoracic wall is not compromised. Gas from within the animal enters the pleural space.</p></list-item>
<p>Closed traumatic is the most common type of pneumothorax (Figure 13.23). This usually occurs secondary to blunt external trauma, such as a road traffic accident. A bronchus or area of lung tissue ruptures when the sudden blow to the thorax increases intrathoracic pressure against a closed glottis. Another possibility is that internal shearing forces may create a subpleural bleb (see Chapter 12) that goes on to rupture.</p>
<p>Open traumatic pneumothorax occurs due to thoracic wall injuries. Typical examples include gun shot, bite or stab wounds or injury secondary to road accidents. Air rapidly enters the pleural space through the wound during inspiration, and pleural and atmospheric pressures equilibrate.</p>
<p>There are also some less common causes of traumatic pneumothorax. Air may be introduced iatrogenically into the pleural space during thoracocentesis or pericardiocentesis. Pneumothorax can occur as a complication of pneumomediastinum, but the converse is not true (see Chapter 8). Air may enter the pleural space from the abdomen if a diaphragmatic rupture and free abdominal gas are present.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Spontaneous:</title>
<p>This refers to a pneumothorax occurring where no traumatic or iatrogenic cause can be identified. It is thought to result from the rupture of blebs or bullae (see Chapter 12), and may be considered <italic>primary</italic>, where the lungs are normal, or <italic>secondary</italic>, where underlying lung pathology is present.</p>
<p>Primary spontaneous pneumothorax most commonly occurs in large deep-chested breeds. Hounds, and Siberian Huskies in particular, are over-represented. There is no sex predilection but middle-aged dogs are more commonly affected. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is more common and underlying lung diseases include emphysema, neoplasia, pneumonia, pulmonary abscess, parasites (including <italic>Dirofilaria</italic>, paragonomiasis), migrating plant foreign bodies and asthma (several reports in cats). Pleural adhesions arising from chronic inflammation may also tear, resulting in pneumothorax.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tension:</title>
<p>If the pleural gas pressure exceeds the atmospheric pressure, a tension pneumothorax is present. This occurs when a one-way valve effect exists between the source of air and the pleural space. Air enters the pleural space with inspiration but does not exit with expiration, and positive pressure rapidly develops within the pleural space. The pressure rises with each breath, thus the condition rapidly becomes life-threatening. The lung and vessels collapse and a fatal decrease in ventilation and cardiac output result. The animal&#x2019;s thorax may be clinically observed to expand as the condition progresses.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Liquidopneumothorax:</title>
<p>This is also called hydropneumothorax, and refers to the presence of fluid and gas within the pleural cavity. This condition can arise secondary to trauma (where the fluid is blood) or more often as a complication of pulmonary abscessation or oesophageal perforation (where the fluid is pus). Liquidopneumothorax can create bizarre radiographic patterns, due to the simultaneous presence of border obliteration and hyperlucency. If the presence of gas can be identified, confirming a liquidopneumothorax, this shortens the list of differential diagnoses for pleural effusion.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>General pneumothorax:</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Lung margins retracted from the thoracic wall, diaphragm and spine</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sharply demarcated collapsed lung lobes outlined by gas (see Figure 13.15b)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased opacity of collapsed lobe(s)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No lung markings visible peripheral to the collapsed lung lobe(s) (see Figures 13.2 and 13.15b)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cardiac silhouette may be separated from the sternum by gas lucency<italic></italic> (see Figures 13.4a and 13.23)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pneumothorax is most commonly bilateral, either due to a bilateral entrance of gas or movement across the mediastinum.</p></list-item>
<p>The underlying causes should be sought; although, a causal bleb or bulla is often not identified on radiographs. Uneven collapse of the lung lobes may point towards concurrent pulmonary disease, e.g. contused lung may collapse while normal lung remains inflated. There may be additional findings of skeletal trauma, pulmonary contusion, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, etc.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Tension pneumothorax:</title>
<p>Radiographic features of pneumothorax are seen, in addition to (Figure 13.24):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Progression (worsening) of radiographic changes over a short time</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Mediastinal shift <italic>away</italic> from a <italic>unilateral</italic> tension pneumothorax (uncommon).</p></list-item>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Liquidopneumothorax:</bold></italic> In this condition there are radiographic features of pleural effusion <italic>and</italic> pneumothorax (Figure 13.25):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Cardiac shadow is often obscured</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung margins retracted from the thoracic wall</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Peripheral hyperlucent thoracic cavity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Appearance depends on the amount and relationship of free gas and fluid</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Decubitus or standing views show fluid and gas in the pleural space</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Horizontal fluid&#x2013;gas interface present on horizontal beam views.</p></list-item>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Other techniques:</bold></italic> Occasionally, it is difficult to identify small-volume pneumothorax on survey radiographs. When standard vertical views are used, the DV view may be preferable to a VD view. Generally, the decubitus view (Figure 13.26) increases the likelihood of detecting a small amount of pleural gas. One study showed <italic>detection</italic> was best on decubitus VD and vertical beam left lateral views, but the <italic>amount of gas</italic> was shown best on a vertical beam right lateral view.</p>
<p>End-expiratory radiographs are also useful as the lungs appear more radiopaque, the costodiaphragmatic angles are blunted, and the relative amount of pleural gas is greater compared with the reduced lung volume.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Computed tomography</title>
<p>This is useful to demonstrate small quantities of pleural gas, pleural effusion or pockets of trapped pleural fluid, which may be difficult to visualize radiographically. It is more sensitive for detecting bullae or blebs underlying spontaneous pneumothorax, and may help to guide surgical intervention.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>Radiographs easily surpass ultrasonography in the diagnosis of pneumothorax. However, ultrasonography may be useful to assess gas in the pleural space, especially following ultrasound-guided interventional techniques (such as fine-needle aspiration).</p>
<p>Free gas has an almost identical appearance to gas within the lung (reverberation artefact) and as such is difficult to detect. However, on close observation the gliding movement of the normal lung will not be identified and the gas will be static. Previously identified lung lesions will no longer be seen once pleural gas is present.</p>
<p>Sometimes fluid and gas may be present (e.g. if haemorrhage and pneumothorax have occurred secondary to lung aspirate or biopsy sample). The fluid accumulates ventrally and the gas dorsally. In this situation a so-called &#x2018;curtain sign&#x2019; may be seen in transverse images of the thorax. This refers to the repetitive ventral to dorsal motion of the fluid&#x2013;gas interface with respiration, which has been compared to the lowering of a curtain.</p>

<title>Radiographic anatomy</title>
<p>The boundaries of the canine and feline thoracic cavity consist of the thoracic skeleton, the cranial and caudal thoracic apertures and the covering soft tissue structures. The rib cage is covered by thoracic, pectoral, spinal and other musculature, subcutaneous fat and skin, and serves as an attachment for the thoracic extremities.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Cranial thoracic aperture</title>
<p>The cranial thoracic aperture (also known as the thoracic inlet) is a small passage for the trachea, oesophagus, vessels and nerves. It is enclosed by the deep fascia as well as the pectoral, scalenius and longus colli muscles. Radiographically, it is synonymous with the area between the first pair of ribs.</p>
<p>The right pleural cupula normally extends to the level of the first rib in the dog (both cupula extend to this level in cats; see Figure 12.1, p. 242). The left pleural cupula extends slightly further cranially in full inspiration in the dog (see Figures 12.1c, p. 242 and 12.2, p. 243).</p>
<p>The thoracic inlet serves as a reference for radiographic tracheal diameter measurements (see Figure 10.3, p. 214) and a tangential radiographic view into the inlet can be used for assessment of tracheal collapse (see Figure 10.13, p. 218). Occasionally, it is used as an ultrasonographic approach for the cranial mediastinum.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Thoracic skeleton</title>
<p>The thoracic skeleton consists of the ribs, sternum and thoracic spine.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ribs</title>
<p>Dogs and cats normally have 13 pairs of ribs, which have the following characteristics:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Flat surface in dogs, cylindrical in cats</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contour:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Evenly curved (barrel-chested dog breeds, cylindrical-shaped feline thorax)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Angled (wedge- or flat-chested dog breeds)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>S-shaped (&#x2018;cottage loaf&#x2019; chest in Basset Hounds and Dachshunds).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consist of a large bony dorsal and small cartilaginous ventral portion (costal cartilage)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The dorsal extremity of the rib consists of a head, neck and tubercle</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Two synovial joints between the rib and the spine:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Costovertebral joint between the rib head and the costal vertebral facet (hinge joint)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Costotransverse joint between the tubercle and the transverse process of the vertebra (sliding joint).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Costochondral junction between the osseous and cartilaginous part of the rib</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Synovial sternocostal joints for the first eight to nine ribs (sternal ribs), remaining ribs fused by connective tissue to each other and the last sternal rib to form the costal arch (asternal or false ribs)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Last one (dogs) or two (cats) pair(s) of ribs not connected to the costal arch (floating ribs).</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Sternum</title>
<p>The sternum consists of a series of eight bones that form the floor of the thorax. The most cranial sternebra is called the manubrium, and the most caudal sternebra is the xiphoid process. The xiphoid cartilage prolongs the xiphoid process caudally. The individual sternebrae are joined by intersternebral cartilage. The first nine ribs articulate with the sternum through the costal cartilages.</p>
<p>Dogs have a curved sternum, which is square in cross section; cats have a cylindrical straight sternum with a flat xiphoid process. The sternum rotates outward in inspiration with the anchor point at the manubrium. The respiratory excursion is higher in cats (3&#x2013;5 degrees) than in dogs (1 degree in the German Shepherd Dog).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Thoracic spine</title>
<p>Dogs and cats usually have 13 thoracic vertebrae, which articulate cranially with a corresponding rib pair. The cranial nine thoracic vertebrae share the following features:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Short bodies with flattened extremities</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Flat articular facets</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Closely fitting vertebral arches</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Long spinous processes with converging orientation. Eleventh, or occasionally tenth, thoracic vertebra is closest to dorsoventral orientation (anticlinal vertebra)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Small transverse process bearing the costal facets for articulation with the ribs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the caudal thoracic spine, the mamillary and accessory processes emerge from the transverse process and diverge in opposite directions (Figure 14.1)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Species and breed differences:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vertebral body shape in cats is more cylindrical than in dogs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Spinal arrangement is physiologically more flexible in cats (curving)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Brachycephalic dog breeds have very short vertebral bodies.</p></list-item>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Caudal thoracic aperture and diaphragm</title>
<p>The diaphragm is a dome-shaped musculotendinous organ that attaches to the costal arch and covers the caudal thoracic aperture. It develops from six embryogenic segments into two muscular masses, the crura diaphragmatica, and a central collagenous tendon. The normal adult diaphragm has three openings:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Dorsal aortic hiatus (for aorta, azygos vein and thoracic duct)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Central oesophageal hiatus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dextroventral caval foramen (for caudal vena cava, CdVC).</p></list-item>
<p>The diaphragm is normally only radiographically visible as an interface between the air-filled lungs and the combined soft tissue opacity of the diaphragm and liver. In obese dogs and most cats, the ventral diaphragm is visible in lateral radiographs as a narrow, soft tissue band between the falciform and retrosternal fat (or caudoventral lung margins) (Figure 14.2). The dorsal portion of the crura diaphragmatica attaches to the ventral surfaces of the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. At this junction the diaphragm forms the lumbodiaphragmatic recess.</p>
<p>The diaphragmatic silhouette has a variable appearance on the different radiographic views (see Figures 1.27, p. 17 and 1.29, p. 18):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>On the lateral view, the tendinous dome is projected cranioventrally and the two crura are projected caudodorsally</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On the ventrodorsal (VD) view, the tendinous dome is projected most cranially with the peak of the dome slightly to the right of midline. Both crura are positioned laterally</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On the dorsoventral (DV) view, only the dome is radiographically visible</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The right crus is positioned cranially to the left crus in right lateral recumbency, and <italic>vice versa</italic> in left lateral recumbency. This is due to the weight of the abdominal organs pushing more on the dependent crus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The right crus can be easily identified radiographically because the CdVC enters the thoracic cavity via the caval foramen through the right crus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The left crus is often underlined by the gas-filled fundus of the stomach</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In right lateral recumbency, the two diaphragmatic </p></list-item>
<list-item><p>	crura tend to run parallel; whereas they are usually converging ventrally in left lateral recumbency.</p></list-item>
<p>The diaphragm forms several recesses where it attaches to the thoracic wall: the dorsal, ventral, right and left costodiaphragmatic recesses. The right and left costodiaphragmatic recesses are located at the same level on both sides (see Figure 1.27, p. 17). On DV/VD views, the point where the projection of the caudal mediastinum joins the shadow of the diaphragm also forms an angle, referred to as the cardiodiaphragmatic angle (see Figure 1.29, p. 18).</p>
<p>Conventional radiography displays the diaphragmatic position only at the precise moment of the exposure. Fluoroscopy allows dynamic assessment of the diaphragm during inspiration and expiration.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Functional aspects of the thoracic boundaries</title>
<p>The thoracic boundaries are constructed to protect the thoracic viscera, yet allow the respiratory expansion of the lungs. During inspiration the diaphragm contracts, resulting in a flattening of its contour. There is opening of the lumbodiaphragmatic and costodiaphragmatic recesses. The diaphragm is the main contributor to inspiratory chest expansion. Contraction of the inspiratory muscles contributes to chest expansion via:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Outward rotation of the ribs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Slight ventral angulation of the sternum</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>First rib pair is fixated by scalenius muscles and thereby acts as an anchor point for rib cage movement.</p></list-item>
<p>During expiration there is passive relaxation of diaphragm, resulting in its dome-shaped cranial contour, and relaxation of the inspiratory muscles. Expiration can be enhanced by contraction of the expiratory thoracic and abdominal musculature. There are slight differences in the functional anatomy of the rib cage in dogs and cats, which are outlined in Figure 14.3.</p>

<title>Interpretive principles</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Thoracic skeleton</title>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ribs</title>
<p>The ribs are often overlooked or not carefully scrutinized during thoracic radiographic assessment. Their small individual size and abundant number, combined with low-contrast chest radiographic technique, makes them blend in with other thoracic structures. To avoid distraction from other thoracic organs, it is useful to evaluate the ribs with the radiograph in a non-standard orientation (see Figure 1.21, p. 14). Assessment of the ribs should be based on the classic R&#x00F6;ntgen signs.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Number, location and symmetry:</title>
<p>It is important to count the ribs when assessing them. If there are rib abnormalities, it is important to know which particular rib is affected:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Monostotic rib lesions are suggestive of primary rib neoplasia, osteomyelitis or focal trauma</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Polyostotic rib lesions are suggestive of trauma, osteochondromatosis, osteomyelitis (bite wounds, migrating foreign body), or underlying metastatic or metabolic disease.</p></list-item>
<p>Asymmetry of rib spacing can be an indicator of:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Thoracic and spinal deformities</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Local trauma or previous surgery</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unilateral pneumothorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Unilateral hyper- or hypoinflation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Oblique radiographic technique (artefactual).</p></list-item>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Shape and opacity:</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Osteolysis (Figure 14.4):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Irreversible destruction of bone by aggressive disease</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Active destruction of the rib cortex and/or medulla</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Punctate lucencies in bone marrow tumour (multiple myeloma or lymphoma)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May lead to pathological fracture</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tangential radiographs helpful in subtle lesions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Osteopenia (see Figures 14.5 and 14.43):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Benign, reversible process</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Predominant mineral resorption due to: local disuse (Wolff&#x2019;s law), leading to detached rib fragments; or generalized disturbance of calcium homeostasis, commonly seen with hyperparathyroidism and hyperadrenocorticism</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>May lead to pathological fractures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Periosteal reaction (Figure 14.6):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A reparative or proliferative process of bone</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Active and/or proliferative processes have more irregular margins</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inactive and/or benign processes have smoother margins</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The nature of the periosteal reaction plus other features (e.g. osteolysis) will indicate whether the process is aggressive or benign.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sclerosis and osteopetrosis (Figure 14.7):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased radiopacity without alteration in shape due to internally laid down bone</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sclerosis is a local phenomenon in response to applied stress (Wolff&#x2019;s law) and is rarely seen in ribs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Osteopetrosis (myelosclerosis) is a generalized condition with defective bone resorption (bone dysplasia). It can be associated with diseases affecting the bone marrow (feline leukaemia virus, pyruvate kinase deficiency or other genetic defects). It affects the entire skeleton but ribs are among the most evidently affected bones. Affected ribs have a marbled opaque appearance.</p></list-item>
<p>Other indicators of rib pathology include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Adjacent soft tissue swelling</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Extrapleural sign (see Figures 14.4 and 14.35c). This sign is characterized by a locally concave peripheral lung margin and signifies the presence of a mass originating from the pleura, chest wall or ventral mediastinum (sternal lymphadenopathy).</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Soft tissues of the thoracic wall</title>
<p>The soft tissue mantle of the rib cage should be thin and even. Skin folds are common in many dog breeds, and are particularly prominent in Shar Peis (Figure 14.8). They can cast a disturbing pattern of lucencies and opacities over the entire thorax. Skin folds should be differentiated from intrathoracic pathology; skin folds extend beyond the thoracic margins. They can give rise to a false appearance of pneumothorax (pseudopneumothorax) (see Chapter 13).</p>
<p>Subcutaneous emphysema is a common sequel to neck and chest wall injuries (Figure 14.9) and displays a pattern of dispersed lucencies over the thorax, which could be misinterpreted as lung pathology. Two views and careful examination of the soft tissues with an intense light source will aid in differentiation:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Usually extends beyond the chest wall margin</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can be localized to skin via an orthogonal view.</p></list-item>
<p>A wet haircoat and subcutaneous oedema create a mottled or streaky (hair) opacity superimposed on the thorax. Ultrasound coupling gel can also give rise to confusing patterns and should be thoroughly wiped off before radiography.</p>
<p>Lipomas, nipples and other soft tissue masses should be recognized radiographically. If palpable, it can be useful to mark masses with barium or a radiopaque marker, to account for their contributing radiopacity to the radiographic image.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Spine</title>
<p>For proper radiographic assessment of the thoracic spine it is important to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Position the animal in an extended position, preferably under general anaesthesia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensure straight positioning by use of positioning devices (foam wedges, trough):</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sternum overlaps spine on a VD radiograph</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dorsal arches of rib pairs superimpose on a lateral radiograph.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obtain a VD view rather than a DV radiograph (to avoid magnification).</p></list-item>
<p>Assessment of the spine relevant to thoracic diseases should include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Counting the number of vertebrae</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Relative position, size, shape and opacity of thoracic vertebrae and spine as a whole:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rule out fractures and aggressive bone lesions</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Relate to rib abnormalities</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rule out scoliosis, lordosis and kyphosis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Assessment of the intervertebral disc spaces for size and margination.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Sternum</title>
<p>The sternum is best evaluated on the lateral view (see Figure 1.23, p. 15) because of superimposition over the spine on straight VD/DV views. Oblique views can be helpful if sternal abnormalities are suspected. Normal degenerative ageing features include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Formation of ventral or dorsal bony spurs, bridging between sternebrae</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mineralization of sternal cartilages and sternal&#x2013;costal junctions.</p></list-item>
</sec2>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diaphragmatic silhouette</title>
<p>Several parameters should be taken into consideration when assessing the diaphragm radiographically:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Position</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Shape and symmetry</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Integrity and contour.</p></list-item>
<p>Numerous technical and patient-related factors have a great influence on the appearance of the diaphragmatic silhouette. These should be ruled out before diaphragmatic disease is diagnosed, and include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Location of the central ray and beam direction. The diaphragm appears different on radiographs centred over the abdomen</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Visceral distension, obesity, state and depth of respiration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recumbency of animal</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Breed-specific chest conformation.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diaphragmatic displacement</title>
<p>Diaphragmatic displacement is usually caused by thoracic or abdominal volume increase or reduction. Intrinsic diaphragmatic diseases, causing phrenic laxity, are rare. The position of the diaphragm can be subjectively assessed evaluating:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The distance between the diaphragmatic dome and the cardiac silhouette</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The orientation of the CdVC and cardiodiaphragmatic angle</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The caudal extent and angle of the costodiaphragmatic and lumbodiaphragmatic recesses.</p></list-item>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Unilateral displacement:</title>
<p>DV or VD radiographs are best to assess alterations from the physiological asymmetry of the diaphragm (Figures 14.10, 14.11 and 14.12):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A raised right hemidiaphragm or a depressed left hemidiaphragm will accentuate the asymmetry</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A depressed right hemidiaphragm or a raised left hemidiaphragm will decrease the degree of asymmetry</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The costodiaphragmatic recesses will move cranially or caudally with the raised or depressed hemidiaphragm accordingly, both sides being then at a different level of rib number</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A marked asymmetry of the diaphragm without asymmetry of the costodiaphragmatic angles is usually of no clinical significance.</p></list-item>
<p>If a change in asymmetry of the diaphragm is suspected on the DV view, it should be confirmed by obtaining a VD view and <italic>vice versa</italic>. An increased asymmetry on the VD/DV views often corresponds to a marked disparity in the level of the two crura on the lateral view. Inspiratory as well as expiratory radiographs may help in confirming the asymmetry/disparity of level between the two crura.</p>
<p>Associated radiographic signs, such as thoracic wall integrity, pleural effusion or thickening, mediastinal shift and alterations in lung lobe volumes, should be assessed to identify a potential underlying thoracic aetiology.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Bilateral displacement:</title>
<p>Bilateral displacement of the diaphragm is more difficult to diagnose as the normal shape of the diaphragm is maintained (Figures 14.13, 14.14 and 14.15):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Repeated exposures at various stages of the respiratory cycle or continuous fluoroscopy may be necessary to assess the dynamics of the diaphragm in relation to respiration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In animals with radiographic signs of increased inspiratory effort yet an incompletely contracted diaphragm, an upper airway obstruction impeding respiratory flow and full lung inflation should be considered.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Interrupted outline and changes in diaphragmatic contour</title>
<p>The diaphragmatic silhouette should be assessed on at least two orthogonal views. Radiographic change or interruption of the diaphragmatic contour (see Figures 14.4 and 14.16) can be due to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The presence of soft tissue opacity cranial to the diaphragm (border obliteration)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interruption of the diaphragm with herniation of abdominal organs into the thorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Diaphragmatic masses.</p></list-item>
<p>Tenting of the diaphragm refers to small triangular protrusions with their base at the diaphragm and their peaks toward the lungs. This is frequently seen in cats, due to visualization of the diaphragmatic attachments to the costal arch ribs during deep inspiration. It can be a manifestation of pleural adhesion (inspiration and expiration).</p>
<p>If gas opacities outline both sides of the diaphragm, free peritoneal and/or retroperitoneal gas must be present (see Figure 14.49). The following should be considered:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Pneumoretroperitoneum as an extension of pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recent laparotomy or other gas-introducing procedure</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Abdominal hollow viscus organ rupture</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gastrointestinal ulceration with rupture</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Body wall laceration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gas-producing organisms.</p></list-item>

<sec1 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diseases of the thoracic skeleton</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Congenital and developmental abnormalities</title>
<p>Congenital abnormalities of the thoracic skeleton are a relatively common phenomenon, particularly in dogs, and are often incidental. Rib, spinal and sternal abnormalities are often combined and should be assessed together. It is important to recognize these changes so as not to mistakenly diagnose pulmonary pathology due to superimposition.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Abnormal number of ribs</title>
<p>This is usually an incidental finding, which is only relevant if the ribs are used as a surgical landmark. Supernumerous or subnumerous ribs are usually associated with transitional vertebrae at the cervicothoracic or thoracolumbar junction. Fusion of the first and second ribs is occasionally seen in chondrodystrophic dog breeds. Rib duplication is rare.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>The abnormal number and shape of ribs are easily recognizable (Figure 14.17).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Metaphyseal developmental disorders of ribs</title>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Metaphyseal osteopathy:</title>
<p>Metaphyseal osteopathy (hypertrophic osteodystrophy) is an osteomalacic disease in young growing dogs of unknown aetiology. It primarily affects metaphyses of the long bones but can also affect the ribs, which may be swollen and painful. The condition is usually self-limiting. Radiographic findings include abnormal radiolucent lines in all rib metaphyses. These are seen better on long bone metaphyses.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Rickets:</title>
<p>This is caused by vitamin D deficiency; it is rare in dogs and cats in the developed world. It can result in a <italic>rickettic rosary</italic>, a chain of palpable swellings along the costochondral junctions. Radiographic findings include widening and radiolucency of the metaphyseal side of the physis. Rickets may result in bony deformity.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Sternal abnormalities</title>
<p>Variation in the size and number of sternebrae, and in the shape of the manubrium and xiphoid process, is common and is usually incidental. Cats commonly have a ventrally deviated xiphoid process, which can be painful.</p>
<p><italic>Sternal dysraphism</italic> is the failure of the left and right cartilaginous sternal precursors to fuse. It leads to a ventral defect that is only closed by thoracic fascia and pleura. In the absence of diaphragmatic defects, sternal dysraphism has no adverse respiratory or circulatory consequences.</p>
<p>The absence, splitting or malformation of the xiphoid cartilage has been associated with peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia, which can be a useful radiographic feature in distinguishing this condition from other pericardial diseases.</p>

<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">

<title>Hemivertebrae:</title>
<p>This is a congenital malformation due to hemimetametric displacement or lack of vascularization of somites (Figure 14.19). It can result in spinal curvature. It is very common in screw-tailed dog breeds, where it is usually an incidental finding.</p>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Curved thoracic spine (scoliosis and kyphosis most common) (Figure 14.20)</p></list-item>

</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Other spinal disorders:</title>
<p>Transitional vertebrae (super- or subnumerous thoracic vertebrae) are only clinically relevant if used as surgical landmarks. Spondylosis deformans is very commonly seen in the ventral aspect of the thoracic spine of dogs and cats, and is of no clinical significance. If bone formation over at least four contiguous vertebrae is present, the condition is called disseminated skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), but does not cause thoracic disease. This term is derived from human medicine and its use in animals is controversial.</p>
<p>There is a widespread misconception that intervertebral disc degeneration and prolapse does not occur in the mid-thoracic spine. However, in cats and some dog breeds, such as the German Shepherd Dog, mid-thoracic degenerative disc disease with spinal cord compression is not uncommon.</p>
<p>Radiographic findings are shown in Figures 14.22 and 14.23 (see also Figure 1.23, p. 15):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Identification of transitional vertebrae requires an entire spinal radiographic series</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Spondylosis deformans is characterized by smooth ventral and lateral bone spurs, bridging adjacent endplates</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>DISH is characterized by abundant smooth or irregular new bone formation, along the ventral and lateral aspects of at least four subsequent vertebral bodies</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intervertebral disc degeneration is characterized by a narrowed intervertebral disc space, foramen and articular facet space, and mineralized disc material protruding into the vertebral canal (protrusion or extrusion). Detailed description is beyond the scope of this book (see <italic>BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Neurology</italic>).</p></list-item>

<title>Chondrodysplasias:</title>
<p>These are congenital skeletal deformities, resulting from abnormal cartilage development. They cause proportionate (all bones affected) or disproportionate (affecting primarily facial bones and/or appendicular skeleton) dwarfism. They are often inherited and selectively bred for in many breeds of dogs, e.g. disproportionate dwarfism in Dachshunds and Basset Hounds gives rise to the unusual &#x2018;cottage loaf&#x2019; chest conformation.</p>
<p>Congenital hypothyroidism causes disproportionate dwarfism as a result of arrested thyroid activity. Mucopolysaccharidosis is a group of genetic connective tissue disorders in dogs and cats, which result in generalized skeletal deformities.</p>

<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pectus excavatum:</title>
<p>Pectus excavatum (funnel chest) is a congenital or developmental abnormality, with a variable decrease in the thoracic dorsoventral diameter due to inward deviation of the sternum, especially in its middle portion. It can affect normal respiratory physiology in severe cases. Canine brachycephalic breeds are more commonly affected and concurrent congenital malformations have been reported (hypoplastic trachea, ventricular septal defect, peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia and mucopolysaccharidosis).</p>
<p>Pectus excavatum should be differentiated from physiological respiratory excursion of the sternum, which is relatively high in cats (3&#x2013;5 degrees). With severe inspiratory dyspnoea due to upper airway obstruction, the sternum rotates inward to its maximal range and can mimic mild pectus excavatum. It should also be differentiated from flail sternum (bilateral rib cartilage fractures, see below) by taking radiographs at peak inspiration and expiration.</p>
<p>Radiographic findings<italic></italic> (see Figures 14.26 and 12.17, p. 250) include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>S-shaped ventral aspect of the ribs/costal cartilages with the ribs extending ventral to the sternum, which is superimposed on the cardiac silhouette (lateral radiograph)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Static appearance in inspiratory and expiratory views</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lateral displacement of the cardiac silhouette, usually towards the left (VD/DV view).</p></list-item>
<p>Some radiographic indices have been proposed to assess the severity of the condition/need for surgical intervention:</p>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Fronto-sagittal index</italic>: ratio between the width of the chest at the tenth thoracic vertebra and the distance between the centre of the ventral surface of the tenth thoracic vertebral body and the nearest point on the sternum. Moderate cases have a ratio of 2&#x2013;3. More than 3 is seen in severe cases</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Vertebral index</italic>: ratio between the distance from the centre of the dorsal surface of the tenth thoracic vertebral body to the nearest point on the sternum, and the dorsoventral diameter of the vertebral body at the same level. Moderate cases have a ratio of 6.00&#x2013;8.99. Less than 6 indicates a severe case</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The vertebral index better differentiates normal from abnormal chest conformation, but there is still some overlap between the groups and diagnosis should not be based solely on indices.</p></list-item>

<title>Flat pup syndrome:</title>
<p>Flat pup syndrome (swimmers, turtle pup) is presumably a congenital condition in dogs, similar to pectus excavatum (decreased dorsoventral thoracic diameter)<italic>,</italic> but without inward rotation of the sternum. &#x2018;Swimmer puppies&#x2019; have flattened chests and move dragging themselves by paddling their limbs laterally and caudally. Being kept on smooth floors and being overweight are believed to be contributing factors. Both chondrodystrophic and non-chondrodystrophic breeds can be affected. Radiographs show that the chest is flattened dorsoventrally, with no inward deviation of the sternum.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Pectus carinatum:</title>
<p>Pectus carinatum (pigeon or keeled chest) is a rare congenital or developmental abnormality, with an increase in the dorsoventral diameter of the thoracic cavity due to the outward deviation of the cranial sternebrae, together with an inward deviation of the most caudal sternebrae. It is usually incidental. There is a possible relationship with congenital cardiac abnormalities. Radiographs show an increased dorsoventral dimension of the rib cage due to caudal displacement of the sternum.</p>

<title>Fractures of the thoracic skeleton</title>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Rib fractures</title>
<p>Most rib fractures are of <italic>traumatic</italic> origin. However, particularly in outdoor cats or stray animals, a traumatic history is not always known. Traumatic fractures are usually transverse, oblique or segmental, and are often multiple and sequential. Displaced fragments can cause penetrating injuries, and open or closed pneumothorax. With a known history of trauma, rib fractures should be taken as an indicator of potential adjacent lung trauma. Radiographic signs of lung contusion may only become visible 6 hours after the injury; serial radiographs are useful to monitor pulmonary disease in such cases.</p>
<p>Rib fractures and thoracic wall bruising can be very painful and impair proper ventilation, leading to hypoxaemia. Non-displaced rib fractures are most commonly treated conservatively (analgesia and rest), whereas internally displaced rib fractures need surgical reduction and stabilization.</p>
<p>Flail chest is associated with the presence of three or more sequential segmental rib fractures or five or more single rib fractures.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Causes paradoxical movement of the affected portion of the thoracic wall (inward on inspiration, outward on expiration).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Worsens hypoxaemia and contusion to the underlying lung parenchyma.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Requires surgical stabilization.</p></list-item>
<p>Flail sternum is a specific form of flail chest, which can occur with multiple bilateral rib cartilage fractures and paradoxical respiratory movement of the sternum.</p>
<p><italic>Pathological</italic> or <italic>stress</italic> rib fractures are not uncommon and can be associated with conditions that weaken the bone structure, or as a result of chronic hyperinflation and cough. Features of pathological fractures include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Usually chronic malunion or non-union fracture</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>More common in females and cats</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Often multiple</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Preferential caudal and dorsal location (serratus dorsalis cranialis muscle insertion)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Often coincident with hiatal hernia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Occasionally occur as a greenstick fracture</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Usually not painful.</p></list-item>
<p>Without traumatic history, rib fractures should be considered as an indicator for underlying osteopenic, osteolytic or respiratory conditions. Possible underlying diseases of pathological or stress fractures are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Chronic feline renal disease or other causes of hyperparathyroidism</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rib neoplasia (fracture consistent with lesion location)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Feline asthma, chronic canine bronchial disease</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lobar emphysema.</p></list-item>
<p>Because of the constant movement of the thoracic bellows, ribs have a poor healing tendency and non-union or malunion fractures are commonly seen. The age of a fracture should be considered when relating it to the history and current complaint of the patient.</p>

<title>Osteochondroma</title>
<p>This is a skeletal dysplasia (a form of hamartoma) associated with expansile bony lesions, which usually arises from the osteochondral junction of bones. The lesion usually stops growing at the time of skeletal maturity. Aetiological theories include:
<list list-type="bullet">

<p>It is potentially a hereditary condition. In rare cases malignant transformation may occur. Commonly affected areas are the costochondral rib junctions; less frequently, the metaphyses of the long bones and vertebrae may be involved. Small rib lesions are common in dogs, but rare in cats.

<title>Rib and chest wall tumours</title>
<p>Primary rib tumours are relatively rare in dogs and very rare in cats; there is no known sex or breed predisposition, and they are also seen in young animals. Osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma are the most common; fibrosarcoma, haemangiosarcoma and benign neoplasms (osteoma, chondroma) are seen less frequently. Primary tumours are often located in the distal third of the rib (costochondral junction). They tend to metastasize to the lungs and other organs. Primary rib tumours are rare compared with appendicular primary bone tumours. Clinical signs are associated with the enlargement of the mass:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fixed firm chest wall mass in some cases</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can expand predominantly intrathoracically without a visible external mass</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dyspnoea, cough due to lung compression and/or haemothorax</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Front limb lameness if impeding on shoulder joint or brachial plexus.</p></list-item>
<p>Metastatic, bone marrow and invading soft tissue neoplasia in ribs have certain features:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Metastatic rib tumours are usually small and located in the proximal or middle portion of the rib</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Multiple myeloma frequently affect the ribs along with the vertebrae and other bones, where changes are more easily recognizable</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Primary bone lymphoma or bone involvement in multicentric lymphoma is rare in dogs and cats. Young animals can be affected. Primary bone lymphoma can preferentially affect the metaphyses in growing bones</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The most common soft tissue mass of the chest wall is fibrosarcoma, which is particularly common in cats. Fibrosarcomas can usually be distinguished from diffuse processes, such as cellulitis or haemorrhage, by their focal distribution and their propensity to grow toward the thoracic cavity. They can be difficult to differentiate from primary rib tumours. There is often polyostotic involment in soft tissue tumours</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pleural neoplasia (mesothelioma) can affect multiple ribs and be difficult to differentiate from other types of neoplasia.</p></list-item>
<p>Lipoma and liposarcoma may arise from the thoracic wall. Benign lipomas are extremely common in the subcutaneous layers of the thoracic wall, and are characterized as soft, moveable slow-growing masses. Occasionally, a benign mass arises from the internal thoracic wall and causes a mass effect on internal thoracic organs. Infiltrative lipomas and liposarcomas can also infiltrate the inter- and intramuscular layers of the thoracic wall.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Tangential and opposite lateral radiographs are often helpful. Osteolysis is seen (Figure 14.35) but can be subtle to detect. There may be an irregular to sunburst periosteal reaction and amorphous new bone. Fractures may be present, with unsharp margins (pathological fracture). The extrapleural sign (focal inward deviation of the pleural and pulmonary structures) may be seen. There may be displacement of adjacent ribs.</p>

<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Other imaging techniques:</title>
<p>Ultrasonography is helpful to differentiate a mass lesion from pleural effusion, lung and other internal thoracic structures, and to characterize the nature and extent of the lesion. Assessment can be made of the mass movement in relation to respiration:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Chest wall mass moves with the rib cage</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung mass moves with pulmonary excursion</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Smooth convex mass displaces the normal pleura&#x2013;lung interface inwards.</p></list-item>
<p>Most neoplasms have a mixed echogenic appearance (Figure 14.37a), often with central hypoechoic (necrosis, haemorrhage) regions. Hyperechoic foci with shadowing (soft tissue mineralization) may be identified. The margins may or may not be discernible. The echogenicity of the mass should always be compared with the adjacent normal tissue. This can be useful in identifying a lipoma, which is uniformly hyperechoic compared with the surrounding tissue (Figure 14.37b). A liposarcoma is more echogenic and less organized than a lipoma.</p>
<p>Ultrasonography is rarely tissue- or cell-specific but is very useful in guiding a needle into a mass for aspiration or biopsy. CT and MRI can be very helpful to assess:

<p>Infections of the thoracic wall result from foreign bodies, lacerations, bite wounds or surgical wound contamination. Migrating foreign bodies, such as grass awns, penetrating via the skin, or a wooden skewer, penetrating via the gastrointestinal tract, can cause inflammatory disease, an abscess/granuloma, a fistulous tract in the thoracic wall region or even lead to pleural effusion. Inhaled grass awns often migrate towards the epaxial musculature of the cranial lumbar spine, causing local abscessation and spondylitis. Fungal or parasitic (hepatozoonosis) osteomyelitis and cellulitis occur in endemic areas. These lesions are often very painful, more so than neoplasia.</p>

<title>Diseases of the diaphragm</title>
<sec2 id="ch-ss">
<title>Diaphragmatic rupture</title>
<p>Diaphragmatic ruptures are usually traumatic in origin. They are frequently misnamed as <italic>acquired diaphragmatic hernias.</italic> This is an incorrect term, since the prolapsed organs are not contained within a hernial sac.</p>
<p>The diaphragm normally ruptures at its weakest point, following a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure while the glottis is open. The site and size of the rupture are variable. Right-sided tears are reported to be more frequent than left-sided. Tears can extend from one side to the other and be radial or circumferential.</p>
<p>The liver is the most frequently prolapsed organ with right-sided ruptures; the stomach is the most frequently prolapsed organ with left-sided ruptures. Prolapse of the small intestines and omentum can be present with any tear. Less commonly prolapsed organs include the spleen, large intestine, omentum, uterus and kidney.</p>
<p>The most frequent clinical sign is dyspnoea; ranging from mild to severe, depending on the volume of the prolapsed organs and fluid accumulation. Other clinical signs can be present, such as regurgitation or vomiting, and are related to the organ prolapsed in the thoracic cavity. Gastric prolapse is a surgical emergency as sudden strangulation and bloating may quickly become life-threatening.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography</title>
<p>A DV view should be taken to avoid further respiratory compromise. Positional radiographs, such as a lateral view using a horizontal beam, should be considered if the respiratory distress worsens in lateral recumbency. It is useful to obtain abdominal radiographs to be able to check for the presence of abdominal organs. One or more of the following radiographic signs can be detected (Figure 14.47):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Loss or change of contour of the diaphragmatic outline</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obliteration and/or dorsal displacement of the cardiac shadow</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased opacity of the ventral thoracic cavity, with or without elevation of the trachea and/or cardiac silhouette</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mediastinal shift</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Presence of gas-filled tubular structures and/or speckled mineral opacities, suggestive of the ingesta-filled gastrointestinal tract being located within the thoracic cavity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pleural effusion may be present and mask herniated parenchymal organs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lung lobe collapse</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Absence of abdominal organs from the abdominal cavity is often associated with cranioventral displacement of the stomach axis. Some organs may be clearly identified within the thoracic cavity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In cats, falciform fat may be the only abdominal organ herniated, in which case the fat pad ventral to the liver will appear very small, the liver will be closer to the abdominal wall and the ventral outline of the diaphragm will be lost</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Other radiographic signs of trauma (e.g. rib fractures, lung contusions and appendicular skeleton fractures).</p></list-item>
<p>A diaphragmatic tear without organ prolapse cannot be ruled out based on the absence of radiographic signs.</p>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Contrast studies:</bold></italic> Contrast studies which may aid diagnosis include:</p>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Barium transit studies</italic> (Figure 14.48) are useful if survey radiography is equivocal. Radiographs should be repeated over a time period long enough to demonstrate the presence of the stomach, small and/or large intestines within the thoracic cavity, or cranioventral displacement of the gastric axis if only liver has herniated. Barium studies are contraindicated when perforation of the gastrointestinal tract is suspected in addition to the diaphragmatic rupture. Water-soluble iodinated agents can be used instead</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Positive-contrast peritoneography</italic>. A positive non-ionic iodine-based contrast medium is injected into, and should remain in, the peritoneal cavity. If positive contrast medium is found in the pleural space, diaphragmatic rupture is confirmed. A negative study does not rule out a diaphragmatic rupture since, in chronic cases, adhesions may obstruct the tear</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x2022; <italic>Pneumo</italic>- or <italic>capnoperitoneography</italic> (Figure 14.49). Positive-contrast studies are preferred and easier to interpret. A small quantity of gas is injected into the peritoneal cavity. If a pneumothorax is then radiographically visible, diaphragmatic rupture is confirmed. Carbon dioxide is preferred due to the reduced risk of vascular air emboli (capnoperitoneography). A negative study does not rule out a diaphragmatic rupture.</p></list-item>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>This is a useful non-invasive method to identify an unclear case of diaphragmatic rupture and organ prolapse. It can be difficult to determine this as the normal diaphragmatic outline is hard to visualize and mirror image artefacts can be confusing. The following should be looked for:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Visualization of abdominal organs in the pleural cavity. Differentiation between normal liver and consolidated/collapsed lung may be difficult</p></list-item>

<title>Diaphragmatic hernias</title>
<p>Diaphragmatic hernias are common congenital anomalies in dogs and cats, due to agenesis of a portion of the diaphragm or lack of fusion between the parts of the primitive diaphragm. They include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Ventral diaphragmatic hernias</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hiatal hernias</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Paraoesophageal intramediastinal hernias</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Peritoneopericardial hernias</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Aortic hiatal diaphragmatic hernias.</p></list-item>
<p>In contrast to diaphragmatic ruptures, the prolapsed abdominal organs are contained within a peritoneal or pericardial hernial sac, i.e. are <italic>herniated.</italic> Diaphragmatic hernias are usually found in young animals with no history of trauma. They appear in predetermined areas of the diaphragm and may be associated with other congenital defects. No granulation or scar tissue will be found during surgery. Hiatal hernias may be acquired. Hernia of the cranial abdominal wall can lead to a <italic>paracostal hernia,</italic> where the hernial sac is contained between the ribs and soft tissue layers of the thorax.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Paracostal abdominal wall hernia</title>
<p>Herniation of viscera occurs via a body wall defect at the costal arch. Abdominal viscera are contained in the subcutaneous layers of the thoracic wall.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>There is a soft tissue swelling along the body wall, which may contain gas-filled viscera (Figure 14.50).</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Ventral diaphragmatic hernia</title>
<p>Ventral (true) diaphragmatic hernias are typically due to a congenital lack of fusion between parts of the primitive diaphragm, which leads to the persistence of an aperture through which abdominal organs herniate into the thoracic cavity. Abdominal organs are contained within a hernial sac, usually the parietal pleura of the diaphragm, which prevents direct communication between the peritoneal and pleural cavities. True ventral diaphragmatic hernias are rare in animals. They are usually small and not associated with clinical signs.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>There is a cranial bulge in the ventral diaphragmatic silhouette with a possible cardiac shift away from the bulge on a lateral radiograph.</p>
</sec3>
<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Hiatal hernia</title>
<p>A hiatal hernia corresponds to a herniation of any abdominal organ through the oesophageal hiatus. It is most often congenital in origin but can be acquired, following the repair of a chronic diaphragmatic rupture or secondary to a traumatic event, oesophageal/upper respiratory tract pathologies or neuromuscular disorders. Three main types of hiatal hernia are recognized in animals (Figure 14.51):
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Short oesophagus hiatal hernia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sliding hiatal hernia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Paraoesophageal hiatal hernia.</p></list-item>
<p>Sliding and paraoesophageal hiatal hernias can coexist. Chinese Shar Pei dogs are predisposed for hiatal hernias.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Short oesophagus hiatal hernia:</title>
<p>The lower oesophageal sphincter lies in the caudal mediastinum due to a short oesophagus. The cardia is pulled through the oesophageal hiatus. This type of hernia is very rare and has only been described in the dog.</p>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Radiographic findings include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Ovoid soft tissue opacity in the mid-caudal thorax with a locally obliterated diaphragmatic silhouette on a lateral radiograph.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Central, slightly left-sided location of opacity on DV/VD views.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Permanent appearance.</p></list-item>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Sliding intramediastinal hiatal hernia:</title>
<p>The lower oesophageal sphincter moves freely back and forth into the caudal mediastinum, followed by parts of the stomach, through a loose oesophageal hiatus (see Figure 14.51a). Clinical signs include variable degrees of vomiting or regurgitation, hypersalivation and chronic weight loss. If the stomach is incarcerated, severe respiratory distress can be present. Aspiration pneumonia is frequently associated with this condition.</p>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Radiography:</title>
<p>Radiographic findings (Figure 14.52) include:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Semicircular soft tissue mass, merging with the liver shadow localized between the CdVC and the aorta on the lateral view and in the caudal mediastinum on the DV view, superimposed over the hepatic shadow</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gas present in the herniated stomach may allow recognition of rugal folds. If a large portion of the stomach is herniated and incarcerated, a large hyperlucent cyst-like structure surrounded by a thin soft tissue rim may be seen. In this case, lung collapse and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side is also visible</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Radiographic signs of aspiration pneumonia may be an associated finding.</p></list-item>
<p>Radiographic signs might be absent, particularly during expiration, due to the sliding nature of the hernia. Positional radiography is usually unsuccessful in demonstrating a sliding hiatal hernia.</p>
<p>Contrast studies (Figure 14.53) may aid diagnosis:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A barium oesophagram may confirm suspicion of a sliding hiatal hernia. As the lower oesophageal sphincter moves back and forth, it can be in a normal position at the time of the examination</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gastric rugae may be visible both in the caudal mediastinum and in the cranial abdomen, separated by a marked narrowing at the level of the oesophageal hiatus</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The lower oesophageal hiatus can be seen cranial to the cardia as a shallow indentation. It also allows assessment of concurrent oesophageal disorders, such as strictures or masses.</p></list-item>
</sec5>
<sec5 id="ch-ss">
<title>Fluoroscopy:</title>
<p>This, together with an oesophagram, allows dynamic assessment of the position of the lower oesophageal sphincter and of the stomach. As the lower oesophageal sphincter function is altered due to its abnormal position, gastro-oesophageal reflux of contrast medium may be seen associated with swallowing.</p>
</sec4>
<sec4 id="ch-ss">
<title>Paraoesophageal hiatal hernia:</title>
<p>The lower oesophageal sphincter remains in place and is competent, but part of the stomach surrounded by a peritoneal sac herniates through the oesophageal hiatus parallel to an immobile oesophagus. Two subtypes exist:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Abdominal organs may herniate to the left of the oesophagus in which case they come to lie in the pleural cavity (see Figure 14.51b)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Abdominal organs may also slide to the right of the oesophagus and herniate into the potential space between the two mediastinal pleural leaves (Sussdorf&#x2019;s space &#x2013; <italic>cavum mediastini serosum</italic> or <italic>bursa infracardiaca</italic>) (see Figure 14.51c). This space is normally closed by a thin membrane, which may be congenitally weak or ruptured following trauma. The prolapsed organs, usually part of the stomach, liver or small intestines, can move in and out as the space widens during inspiration and shrinks during expiration.</p></list-item>
<p>Clinical signs may range from none to recurrent gastrointestinal signs, including anorexia, retching, vomiting or bloating of the stomach without gastric torsion.</p>

<sec3 id="ch-ss">
<title>Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia</title>
<p>Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH) is the most common diaphragmatic hernia in dogs and cats. It is due to an embryological fusion defect in the ventral diaphragm, leading to a communication between the pericardial and the peritoneal cavities. PPDHs are often associated with sternal or cardiac defects. The liver is the most frequently herniated organ, and may be associated with gallbladder, stomach, small intestine or omental herniation.</p>
<p>Clinical signs depend on the organs herniated and the size of the defect, and include respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disorders. Auscultation may reveal muffled heart sounds or borborygmy over the cardiac area. Sudden onset of clinical signs may arise secondary to strangulation of a herniated organ. Most frequently no clinical signs are present and a PPDH is found incidentally.</p>

<title>Aortic hilar hernia</title>
<p>The aortic hilus is the only diaphragmatic opening that connects the mediastinum with the retroperitoneal space. Free mediastinal gas can pass through the hilus and enter the retroperitoneal space relatively easily.

<title>Diaphragmatic (phrenic nerve) paralysis</title>
<p>The phrenic nerves arise from the fifth to the seventh cervical nerves, and run through the cranial mediastinum and on each side of the dorsal pericardium. Diaphragmatic paralysis can be uni- or bilateral, temporary or permanent. Diaphragmatic paralysis causes paradoxical diaphragmatic movement; a cranial movement of the affected hemidiaphragm at inspiration and a caudal movement at expiration (Kienbock&#x2019;s phenomenon). Associated inward movement of the abdominal wall at inspiration and outward movement at expiration occurs in bilateral paralysis. Unilateral paralysis of the diaphragm rarely causes any clinical signs, whereas bilateral paralysis often causes moderate to severe signs.</p>

<title>Diaphragmatic flutter</title>
<p>Flutter of the diaphragm consists of synchronous spastic contractions of one or both hemidiaphragms. It occurs synchronous with the first heart sound. It is thought to be due to a lower threshold of excitability of the phrenic nerves at the level of the pericardium, which allows their stimulation by action currents of the myocardium. It is commonly a self-limiting condition that disappears if the underlying cause is treated, usually an electrolyte imbalance of variable origin. Marked rhythmic movements of the costal arch and the abdominal wall are the only clinical signs of a diaphragmatic flutter. These can last from only a few days to several months.</p>
