<caption><title>Basic principles of tracheal and bronchial displacement on the lateral radiograph. The positions of the trachea, carina and caudal mainstem bronchi can be very useful to assess cardiac chamber enlargement. In this series of figures the changes in tracheal and bronchial position on a lateral radiograph are illustrated for various conditions. Note that there is also variation in tracheal position between different breeds of dogs. (a) Normal. The trachea and caudal mainstem bronchi have a gentle ventral divergence from the thoracic spine. Note the normal ventral bend (arrowed) in the trachea just cranial to the carina. (b) Left ventricular enlargement in isolation. The LV elevates the entire trachea when it is enlarged and there is loss of the normal ventral bend cranial to the carina. (c) Left atrial enlargement in isolation. The LA creates a triangular or wedge-shaped soft tissue opacity at the caudal border of the cardiac silhouette and pushes the left caudal mainstem bronchus (shown in dark blue) dorsally. (d) The effect of a cranial mediastinal mass is shown for comparison. A cranial mediastinal mass (shown in pink) can elevate the trachea cranial to the carina anywhere along its length. Depending on the size and location of the mass, this may be focal elevation or more commonly elevation of the entire pre-cardiac trachea. The cardiac size will be normal. (e) Right atrial enlargement or right atrial mass in isolation. It is very rare to see severe focal right atrial enlargement. An enlarged RA can focally elevate the trachea cranial to the carina. (Note that a heart base mass can also elevate the trachea in this position but usually has a different appearance on the </title></caption>

The angle between the left and right caudal mainstem bronchi (shown by the arrow) should be about 60 degrees and form an upside-down V shape. This does vary somewhat with breed, but an increased angle or splayed appearance (&#x2018;cowboy legs&#x2019; sign) suggests left atrial or tracheobronchial lymph node enlargement.

In this instance, the position and size of the pericardial fat stripe, relative to the position of the trachea, suggests enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.

In the type R1 pattern, the right coronary artery (RCA) continues as a single vessel and crosses the caudal crux of the atrioventricular sulcus (open arrow), then continues as the left circumflex (LCx) and left caudal descending (LCD) arteries. In type 2 patterns, the single vessel branches shortly after leaving the aorta. Sub-classifications are made depending on whether the crossing vessel (solid arrow) passes cranial to the pulmonary trunk (PT) (R2A), between the aorta and pulmonary trunk (R2B) or caudal to the aorta (R2C).

<caption><title>Simpson&#x2019;s rule to calculate LV volume from a RPS long-axis four-chamber view. Every attempt should be made to optimize the LV chamber length and area. The LV chamber endocardium is traced around, closing at the mitral annulus, in both diastole and systole. A length from the mitral annulus to the LV apex is drawn. The ultrasound machine software divides this length into 20 divisions, considered as discs. The volume of each disc is calculated, and the sum of volumes of the discs gives the overall LV volume, relatively independent of geometrical assumptions. Both (a) end-diastolic volume (EDV) and (b) end-systolic volume (ESV) are calculated. The ejection fraction is calculated as (EDV&#x2013;ESV)/EDV (usually expressed as a percentage) (normal &#x003E;50&#x0025;). The dog&#x2019;s body surface area (BSA) can be calculated. The end-systolic volume index (ESVI) is the ESV/BSA (normal &#x003C;30 ml/m<sup>2</sup>). The ejection fraction is low and the ESVI is increased in DCM, as in this Boxer.</title></caption>

The E point to septal separation (EPSS) should not exceed 7 mm in any breed. It increases in DCM due to LV dilatation and rounding, and also because of reduced stroke volume.</title></caption>

<caption><title>Images from a 2-year-old British Shorthair cat with HCM. There is marked concentric hypertrophy of the LV. (a) The basal septal bulge may result in turbulence or increased velocity of LV outflow. If the basal septal bulge exceeds 6 mm in diastole, this confirms the presence of significant hypertrophy. (b) A short-axis view can be used to measure wall thickness at the chordal level, ensuring that papillary muscles are not inadvertently included. Diastolic wall thicknesses over 6 mm confirm hypertrophy, as here. (c) The M-mode in feline HCM typically has a cluttered appearance, particularly at mitral valve level. Ao = Aorta; IVS = Interventricular septum; LA = Left atrium; LVFW = Left ventricular free wall.</title></caption>

(b) RPS long-axis five-chamber view. The presence of SAM leads to mitral incompetence, with an eccentric mitral regurgitant jet coursing towards the posterior&#x2013;lateral wall of the LA, as well as colour variance in the LVOT.

<caption><title>Images from a 5-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with a PDA associated with pulmonary hypertension, presented with ascites and other evidence of right-sided congestive heart failure. (a) RPS long-axis four-chamber view shows marked right atrial and right ventricular dilatation, with concentric hypertrophy of the RV wall. The IVS is flattened, which is also appreciated on (b) the RPS short-axis view. The right branch of the pulmonary artery (RPA) is also markedly dilated as it courses around the base of the heart. (c) The RPS cranial view shows the dilated pulmonary trunk with marked pulmonary insufficiency. (d) The left apical four-chamber view shows tricuspid regurgitation by colour flow Doppler. (e) Mean CW Doppler recorded velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet is 4.6 m/s. By the modified Bernoulli equation, there is a systolic PG (4v<sup>2</sup>) between the RV and RA of 84 mmHg. Therefore, pulmonary arterial systolic pressure is at least 90 mmHg (since normal right atrial pressure is about 6 mmHg). (f) The mean velocity of pulmonary regurgitation is 3.4 m/s (recorded from a RPS cranial view). Therefore, the diastolic PG between the main pulmonary artery and RV is 46 mmHg. Thus, the systolic/diastolic pulmonary pressures are estimated to be at least 90/46 mmHg (but this is an underestimate as the dog is in right-sided failure; RA and RV filling pressures will be increased). This has an impact on the PDA flow. There is some left-to-right diastolic flow but in systole, no flow was evident (&#x2018;balanced&#x2019; PDA as a consequence of the pulmonary hypertension).

<caption><title>(a) There are several important differentials for increased perihilar opacity. (i) The normal perihilar structures are seen on lateral and DV views. Note that the angle between the caudal mainstem bronchi can vary with breed and centring of the X-ray beam. (ii) The mass effect created by simultaneous enlargement of the left and right tracheobronchial lymph nodes is demonstrated. Both nodes can accentuate the ventral deflection of the trachea at the carina. The left and right nodes can be separated by looking for the adjacent bronchus. The left bronchus bifurcates immediately ventral to the carina. (iii) The mass effect created by an enlarged middle tracheobronchial lymph node. Note that the caudal lobar bronchi are separated on the DV view and pushed <italic>ventrally</italic> on the lateral view. (iv) The mass effect created by the cranial mediastinal lymph nodes. If these nodes are large enough they can elevate the trachea. Note that heart base tumours are often located in this region and can produce a similar effect. (v) Enlarged pulmonary arteries (and sometimes veins) can sometimes be mistaken for enlarged lymph nodes. This is a diagram of enlargement of the main pulmonary artery in dirofilariasis. (vi) Left atrial enlargement can be easily distinguished from middle tracheobronchial node enlargement. Both separate the caudal mainstem bronchi on a VD/DV view, but on the lateral view the bronchi are depressed ventrally with node enlargement and dorsally (especially the left) with left atrial enlargement.

The thoracic inlet distance (black arrow) is measured from the ventral aspect of the vertebral column at the midpoint of the most cranial rib to the dorsal surface of the manubrium at its point of minimal thickness. The tracheal diameter (white arrow) is measured between the internal surfaces of the tracheal wall oriented perpendicularly to the tracheal long axis at the point where the thoracic inlet line crosses the midpoint of the tracheal lumen.</title></caption>

>A local reduction of the radiographic cervical tracheal luminal gas shadow always represents a true anatomical reduction of the tracheal lumen. The cervical trachea is completely surrounded by soft tissue; therefore, changes in the relative position of some of the adjacent structures (oesophagus, longus colli muscle) do not change the X-ray beam attenuation over the trachea. However, the thoracic portion of the trachea is surrounded by air-filled lung. Superimposing soft tissue lesions at this level could therefore be confused with tracheal pathology.

<caption><title>Diagram illustrating the dependence of tracheal collapse on phase of respiration. During inspiration a slightly positive pressure surrounds the cervical trachea as long as air moves towards the thorax. This positive pressure collapses the cervical trachea if it lacks sufficient stability. In the thoracic area, the pressure surrounding the trachea is lower than the pressure within the trachea, which results in tracheal distension. During expiration, the thoracic pressure exceeds the intratracheal pressure. This reduces the diameter of the thoracic trachea as long as air flows towards the larynx. However, the cervical trachea is distended due to the luminal pressure exceeding the outside pressure. (Adapted from Suter (1984) with permission)</title></caption>

<caption><title>Lung volumes as they appear on a lateral thoracic radiograph of a dog. A normal expiratory radiograph is taken with the lung in functional residual capacity (FRC, small black arrow). At peak inspiration, the tidal volume (TV, between large black arrows) is added. With hyperinflation (stressed animal, air trapping), the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV, between large white arrows) is added and the lung reaches total lung capacity (TLC), deviating the diaphragm caudally. With forced expiration, the FRC may be reduced by the expiratory reserve volume (ERV) to reach the reserve volume (RV, small white arrow) of the lung. If the lung is compressed (mass, increased intrapleural pressure) it can become totally atelectatic (TA). (Reproduced from Suter (1984) with permission)</title></caption>

><bold>Pneumothorax and bullae/blebs</bold><break/>A search for pulmonary bullae/blebs is a common procedure to identify the cause of a pneumothorax. Pneumothorax can hinder or promote visibility of a bulla, depending on the amount of free air, degree of collapse and location of the bulla. Pre- and post-thoracocentesis radiographs are recommended. CT is the modality of choice for the detection of leaking bullous lesions in pneumothorax.<break/>Ruptured bullae/blebs have a tendency to collapse. Identified bullae/blebs are suggestive of the general cause of the pneumothorax (ruptured lung tissue) but the leaking collapsed bullae/blebs may not be visible.<break/>Superficial blebs are more prone to rupture than deep parenchymal bullae. This should be weighted in the decision-making for conservative/surgical treatment of pneumothorax. It may not be safe to release a patient with a large bleb, despite successful drainage of the pneumothorax.<break/>12.64

<caption><title>(a) High-resolution thoracic CT image at the level of the accessory lung lobe of an 8-year-old mixed breed dog in dorsal recumbency under general anaesthesia, with oxygen-supplemented ventilation performed for evaluation of potential metastatic lung disease. The dorsal lung regions are collapsed and cannot be assessed for metastases. The oesophagus is gas- and fluid-distended (*). (b) CT image at the same location from a repeat series obtained with the dog in sternal recumbency. The dorsal lung region is completely aerated again; however, the ventral tip of the right caudal lung lobe is now atelectatic. Oxygen supplementation promotes non-obstructive resorption atelectasis, particularly in the dependent lung regions (hypostatic component). Changes are quickly reversed with recumbency change, enabling diagnosis of atelectasis and assessment of the affected lung regions.</title></caption>

><bold>Why is the right middle lung lobe so prone to collapse with chronic respiratory disease?</bold><break/>It has a high pleural surface area:lung volume ratio, leading <break/>to less collateral ventilation. The opposite is true for the <break/>caudal lobes, which have a low pleural surface area:lung volume ratio, more collateral ventilation, and hence are unlikely to collapse.<break/>12.89

><bold>Species differences</bold><break/>&#x2022;	In dogs, changes are centred on the perihilar region but extend to the periphery of the caudal lung lobes as severity increases. Ventral and peripheral areas are relatively spared, possibly due to greater lymphatic drainage than the hilar regions.

<caption><title>(a) VD thoracic radiograph of a 6-year-old Briard with lobar pneumonia of the right middle lung lobe. There is an alveolar lung pattern with air bronchograms of the entire lobe with clear margination to neighbouring lobes (lobar sign). The heart is partially obliterated by the lobe (border obliteration sign) and mainly contained within the right hemithorax (cardiac shift), indicating a degree of collapse of the right middle lung lobe. (b) Right lateral thoracic radiograph. Due to the hypostatic collapse of the entire right lung, the opacification of the middle lobe is not distinguishable. (c) Left lateral thoracic radiograph. The now non-dependent right lung is fully aerated again, except for the middle lobe which is now visibly opacified. This is an indication of alveolar disease rather than just hypostatic lung collapse. Notice the DV orientation of the right middle bronchus, facilitating preferential aspiration in this lobe.

<caption><title>Altered cardiac position in lateral radiographs with pneumothorax. This phenomenon can be explained by loss of the air-filled lung supporting the heart in its normal anatomical position within the thorax. Where pneumothorax is present on the dependent side, the lack of supportive lung tissue allows the heart to move towards the dependent thoracic wall. The space thus created between the cardiac apex and the sternum is highlighted by the X-ray beam causing the heart to appear elevated from the sternum by distance X.</title></caption>

<caption><title>(a) Fluid distribution in lateral recumbency (shaded area). Fluid in the non-dependent hemithorax is suspended by the cranial mediastinum, producing a soft tissue opacity dorsal to the sternum and causing retraction of the ventral lung margins. The ventral cardiac margin and apex, and the dome of the diaphragm are obscured. Fluid in the lower costodiaphragmatic recess between the lung and the thoracic wall is not visible (perpendicular to beam) but contributes to an increased opacity throughout the thorax.

<caption><title>(a) Fluid distribution in dorsal recumbency (shaded area). Fluid collects dorsally, obscuring the descending aorta, and in the costodiaphragmatic angles, causing blunting of the lung margins. The diaphragmatic crura may be obscured but the dome remains visible. Lungs float upwards and pivot medially at the hilus to lie adjacent to the heart; therefore, the cardiac shadow remains visible. Fluid accumulates between the lungs and the lateral thoracic wall, and in the mediastinal reflection between the left caudal and accessory lobes. The cranial mediastinum remains visible as the cranial thorax is at a higher level than the caudal thorax. Fluid pools dorsally over a larger area than when the animal is in ventral recumbency, so fluid depth and consequent overall opacity are less than on the DV view. The lungs retract in the direction of the arrows. (Reproduced from Suter (1984) with permission) (b) VD thoracic radiograph of a 9-year-old Dobermann with dilated cardiomyopathy and a small amount of cardiogenic pleural effusion. The enlarged cardiac silhouette is clearly visible and a small fissure line can be seen in the right cranial thorax, enabling a diagnosis of cardiac disease and cardiogenic effusion in this patient. The majority of the fluid is pooling in the lumbodiaphragmatic recess where it does not influence visibility of other thoracic organs. (continues)</title></caption>

<caption><title>(continued) (c) Fluid distribution in ventral recumbency (shaded area). Fluid pools ventrally. The lungs float upwards and pivot laterally about the hilus resulting in medial fluid accumulation, causing the mediastinum to appear widened and the cardiac shadow and diaphragm to be obscured. Little fluid accumulates laterally between the lung margins and thoracic walls. The thoracic cavity is narrower ventrally than dorsally, so when the animal is in sternal recumbency, fluid rises to a higher level making overall opacity greater than in a VD view. Interlobar fissures are visible. The lungs retract in the direction of the arrows. (Reproduced from Suter (1984) with permission) (d) DV thoracic radiograph. The cardiac silhouette is completely obliterated by the surrounding pleural fluid, multiple pleural fissure lines are visible and diagnosis of heart disease is not possible.

<caption><title>(a) Lateral and (b) VD radiographs of a 16-weeks-old Persian cat with a PPDH. The cardiac silhouette is grossly enlarged and merges with the diaphragmatic outline ventrally (lateral view) and centrally (VD view). These features distinguish PPDHs from diaphragmatic ruptures.</title></caption>

<caption><title>Lateral thoracic radiograph of a 14-year-old Domestic Shorthair cat with hyperthyroidism. The right kidney is partially herniated into the very dorsocaudal mediastinum and deviates the aorta. This is consistent with an aortic hiatal hernia, which was an incidental finding in this cat.</title></caption>

<caption><title>DV thoracic radiograph of a 3-month-old Boxer with right-sided diaphragmatic paralysis. The diaphragm has an increased asymmetry due to the elevated right hemidiaphragm; the right costophrenic angle is positioned more cranially than the left. Note the cranial direction of the ribs of the right thoracic wall.</title></caption>
