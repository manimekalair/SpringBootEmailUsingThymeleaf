<para><paratext ID="p3" level="1">Pro se plaintiff Freda Tanuvasa obtained a $669,755 mortgage loan in connection with residential real property located at 13236 Rutgers Avenue in Downey, California. (Compl. &#182; 7.) The loan was secured by a Deed of Trust that was recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office on December 11, 2006. (<underscore>Id.</underscore>) The Deed of Trust identifies defendant Washington Mutual Bank (&#x201C;WaMu&#x201D;) as the lender, and the California Reconveyance Company as the trustee. Chase acquired WaMu's banking operations from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#x201C;FDIC&#x201D;) on September 25, 2008.

<head><headtext align="center">1. Damages</headtext></head>
<section.body>
<para><paratext ID="p13" level="1">Plaintiff contends that defendant's alleged TILA violations entitle her to statutory damages.</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p14" level="1">TILA provides that an &#x201C;action [for damages]<charfill numchar="3">&#8228;</charfill> may be brought in any United States district court, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction, within one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation.&#x201D; 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1640(e). The Ninth Circuit has held that the one-year window for filing a TILA damages claim generally &#x201C;runs from the date of the consummation of the transaction.&#x201D; <underscore>King v. State of Cal.</underscore>, 784 F.3d 910, 915 (9th Cir. 1986).</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p15" level="1">TILA's statute of limitations may, however, be subject to equitable tolling. The doctrine of equitable tolling suspends the applicable limitations period &#x201C;until the borrower discovers or had reasonable opportunity to discover the fraud or nondisclosures that form the basis of the TILA action.&#x201D; <underscore>Cervantes v. City of San Diego</underscore>, 5 F.3d 1273, 1277 (9th Cir. 1993). Courts must consider the applicability of equitable tolling whenever a complaint, liberally construed, alleges facts showing the &#x201C;potential applicability of the equitable tolling doctrine.&#x201D;</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p16" level="1">Here, the Court can discern from the face of the complaint that TILA's one-year statute of limitations has run. Plaintiff obtained the loan at issue in this case in December 2006. She filed her complaint in this action on May 15, 2009. Therefore, unless equitable tolling applies, TILA's statute of limitations bars her claim for damages.</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p17" level="1">Plaintiff does not argue that equitable tolling applies, and the Court finds no basis in her complaint for concluding that it should. The complaint does not indicate when plaintiff discovered the alleged TILA violation, and it does not plead facts suggesting that defendant took steps to prevent her from discovering the alleged nondisclosures. The Court thus grants Chase's motion to dismiss plaintiff's TILA damages claim, but grants plaintiff leave to amend her complaint to include facts relevant to the applicability of equitable tolling.</paratext></para>

<para><paratext ID="p26" level="1">As discussed above, plaintiff does not allege that she obtained the mortgage loan at issue in this case for some purpose other than financing the purchase of her home. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the loan is a &#x201C;residential mortgage transaction&#x201D; within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1602(w), and as such, it is excluded from HOEPA's reach.</paratext></para>
