<section.body>
<para><paratext ID="p2" level="1">In May 2005, Skyway, as defendants in the underlying personal injury action, settled with plaintiffs in the underlying action for the sum of $8 million for injuries incurred by plaintiffs. Skyway's third-party complaint for indemnity against Fairchild Dornier Corporation, Fairchild Dornier GmbH, Fairchild Dornier Luftfahrt Beteiligungs GmbH, and Dr. Eberhard Braun (collectively, &#x201C;Fairchild&#x201D;) remains to be litigated.</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p3" level="1">Thereafter, the Fairchild third-party defendants moved for partial summary judgment on the third-party complaint asserting that they are not liable to indemnify Skyway for that portion of Skyway's settlement sum attributable to non-economic damages. On December 30, 2009, Hon. Gary A. Feess issued the Order holding that California law applied and that thereunder, pursuant to Proposition 51, California Civil Code &#167; 1431.2, &#x201C;the liability of each defendant for non-economic damages shall be <ital>several only and shall not be joint.</ital>&#x201D; Order, at 4, quoting Section 1431.2 (emphasis in original). Skyway now seeks certification of that interlocutory order for immediate appeal.</paratext></para>

<para><paratext ID="p13" level="1">Although the Order is, in a sense, &#x201C;controlling&#x201D; as to the issue of whether Skyway may pursue indemnity for non-economic damages, any order, by definition, is controlling as to that which is the subject of the order. What is a more important consideration here is that immediate resolution of the issue on appeal would have minimal impact on the pending litigation or its outcome. Even without an interlocutory appeal, the jury will be instructed to specify which portion of the damages is for economic damages and which portion is for non-economic damages. An immediate appeal would not &#x201C;avoid protracted and expensive litigation,&#x201D; and even if the Order is ultimately overturned on appeal, that would not necessitate retrial. Any potential error in the computation of damages in favor of Skyway could be remedied simply by a mathematical reapportionment of the non-economic damages.</paratext></para>

<section.body>
<para><paratext ID="p14" level="1">Skyway contends that a substantial ground for difference of opinion exists as to whether application of California law would require the conclusion that Section 1431.2 precludes Skyway from recovering for non-economic damages under its indemnity claim here. Skywest points out that, at the time of its settlement with plaintiff, it was not clear which state's laws would apply and it was reasonable to believe that California law might not apply.</paratext></para>

<para><paratext ID="p18" level="1">Skyway contends that because it was reasonable to believe at the time of the settlement that California law might not apply, it was not a &#x201C;volunteer&#x201D; in settling the non-economic damages claim and, therefore, should not be barred from seeking indemnity. On this basis, Skyway contends that there is substantial ground for difference of opinion. The Court notes, however, that as early as February 28, 2005, three months before court approval of the settlement, Skyway asserted that California law and Proposition 51 applied herein.<footnote.reference ID="fr1" refid="f1" style="percent_n">1</footnote.reference> As such, there are indicators that Skyway foresaw the applicability of California law.</paratext></para>

<footnote ID="f2"><footnote.body><para><label.designator>FN2.</label.designator><paratext ID="p24">&#8195;The Court notes that in the Order, there is an error in the analysis used to determine whether California law applies. The Order erroneously asserts that, under <ital>Erie Railroad Co. V. Tompkins</ital>, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938), <ital>California</ital> substantive law applies because this is a diversity jurisdiction case. The <ital>Erie</ital> doctrine, however, merely stands for the proposition that, in a diversity jurisdiction case such as this, it is state substantive law, rather than federal law, that applies. The <ital>Erie</ital> doctrine does not resolve the issue of <ital>which</ital> state's law applies. The resolution of the latter issue requires the application of the forum state's conflict of law rules. <ital>Patton v. Cox</ital>, 276 F.3d 493, 495 (9th Cir. 2002); <ital>Klaxon Co. V.

<section.body>
<para><paratext ID="p25" level="1">Skyway contends that this prong is met because an immediate appeal would significantly reduce the likelihood of a retrial. As mentioned above, however, the Court does not find that there is any likelihood of a retrial. The jury can be instructed to specify the amount of and differentiate between economic damages and non-economic damages. As such, even if the Order is ultimately overturned on appeal, a retrial would not be necessary.<footnote.reference ID="fr3" refid="f3" style="percent_n">3</footnote.reference></paratext></para>
