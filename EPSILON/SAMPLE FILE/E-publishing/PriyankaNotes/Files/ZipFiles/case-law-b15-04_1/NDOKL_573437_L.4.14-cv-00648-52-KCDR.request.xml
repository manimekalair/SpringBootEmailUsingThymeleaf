<para><paratext ID="p1" level="1">Before the Court is plaintiff Trinity Chemical Industries, L.L.C.'s Renewed Motion for Default Judgment (the &#x201C;Motion&#x201D;) (Doc. 45) against defendants Menlo Energy, L.L.C. and Menlo Capital Group, L.L.C., along with plaintiff's supporting documentation (Doc. 50, Exhs. 1, 1A-1H).<footnote.reference ID="fr1" refid="f1" style="percent_n">1</footnote.reference></paratext></para>
<footnote ID="f1"><footnote.body><para><label.designator>FN1.</label.designator><paratext ID="p2">&#8195;On July 26, 2016, the Court directed plaintiff to submit evidence supporting its request for
damages in its Motion. The Court granted plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Submit Evidence Supporting Damages out of Time (Doc. 50) on August 26, 2016 (Doc. 51).</paratext></para>
</footnote.body>
</footnote>
<para><paratext ID="p3" level="1">On June 1, 2016, the Court entered an Order denying plaintiff's first Motion for Default Judgment. (Doc. 44). The Court referred to its October 14, 2015 Order, which granted defendants' Unopposed Motion for Leave to Withdraw as Counsel of Record for Defendants (Doc. 34), and directed defendants to &#x201C;cause new counsel to enter an appearance&#x201D; and respond to plaintiff's discovery requests within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Order. (Doc. 35). In both its October 14, 2015 and June 1, 2016 Orders, the Court made abundantly clear that defendants' failure to comply with the Court's directives could result in a Judgment against defendants. (<ital>See</ital> Docs. 35, 44).</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p4" level="1">To date, defendants have altogether failed to comply with the Court's Orders. Specifically, as of the date of plaintiff's Motion, no new counsel has entered an appearance on behalf of defendants. Moreover, plaintiff represents that discovery has remained stalled. (Doc. 45 at 1). While the Court declined to find that defendants had acted willfully or in bad faith in its June 1, 2016 Order, at this point it is clear that this is no longer the case. Defendants have been provided ample time and multiple chances to comply with the rulings of this Court, but have simply failed to abide by any of them. Default judgment is therefore proper. <ital>Lee v. Max Int'l, LLC</ital>, 638 F.3d 1318, 1320-21 (10th Cir. 2011) (holding that the district court's discretion &#x201C;easily embraces the right to dismiss or enter default judgment in a case under Rule 37(b) when a litigant has disobeyed two orders compelling production of the same discovery materials in its possession, custody, or control&#x201D;).</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p5" level="1">Plaintiff's Motion requests damages in the amount of $1,134,765.23 plus eight percent (8%) interest accruing after October 31, 2015. (Doc. 45 at 2). The same amount, interest rate, and date of accrual were alleged in plaintiff's Amended Complaint. (Doc. 4 at 4, &#182; 22). However, the evidence submitted by plaintiff in support of its Motion supports a different damages award and interest accrual date. First, plaintiffs have provided evidence that they have mitigated their damages in the amount of $276,544.00. (Doc. 50, Ex. 1 at 3, &#182; 13; Doc. 50, Exh. 1E). Having reviewed the affidavit of plaintiff's Chief Financial Officer, Daniel K. Kittinger (Doc. 50, Exh. 1), the Master Railcar Service Agreement (&#x201C;Master Agreement&#x201D;) (Doc. 50, Exh. 1A), and plaintiff's supporting documents and financial calculations (Doc. 50, Exh. 1B-1H), the Court finds that total net damages in the amount of $858,662.02 are proper.</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p6" level="1">Second, as to interest, Article 13 of the Master Agreement sets forth the applicable eight percent (8%) interest rate agreed to by the parties. Article 13 further states that plaintiff is entitled to interest accruing on the unpaid sum from the &#x201C;due date to the date of payment&#x201D; and that plaintiff is entitled to accelerate and declare the entire remaining amount of rent due upon termination of the contract. (Doc. 50, Exh. 1A, at 6). Plaintiff delivered its written notice of termination of the Master Agreement to defendant on June 10, 2014. (Doc. 50, Exh. 1D). Accordingly, June 10, 2014 is the proper accrual date for the purpose of calculating plaintiff's prejudgment interest.</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p7" level="1">IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment (Doc. 45) is <bold>granted</bold> against defendants, jointly and severally, in the amount of $858,662.02 in addition to eight percent (8%) interest accruing after June 10, 2014. As to plaintiff's request for attorney's fees and costs, plaintiff is directed to follow the procedures set forth in LCvR54.1 and LCvR54.2.</paratext></para>
