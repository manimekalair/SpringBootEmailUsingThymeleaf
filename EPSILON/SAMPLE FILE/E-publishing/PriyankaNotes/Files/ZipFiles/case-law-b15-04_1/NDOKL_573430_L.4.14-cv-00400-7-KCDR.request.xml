<para><paratext ID="p1" level="1">Before the Court is defendant Nabholz Construction, Inc.'s Notice of Removal (Doc. 2). Defendant asserts diversity of citizenship pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332 as a basis for this Court's jurisdiction. Defendant represents that, based upon plaintiff Elston Hargraves' petition, there is no question as to diversity of the parties, but that &#x201C;it is unclear whether Plaintiff's damages exceed the jurisdictional amount of $75,000.&#x201D; (<ital>Id.</ital> at 2).</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p2" level="1">A case shall be remanded if, at any time before final judgment, it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1447(c). &#x201C;&#x2018;Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,&#x2019; possessing &#x2018;only that power authorized by Constitution and statute.&#x2019;&#x201D; <ital>Sunshine Haven Nursing Op., LLC v. U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., Ctrs. for Medicare and Medicaid Servs.</ital>, 742 F.3d 1239, 1246 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting <ital>Devon Energy Prod. Co. v. Mosaic Potash Carlsbad, Inc.</ital>, 693 F.3d 1195, 1201 (10th Cir. 2012)). The party invoking the court's jurisdiction has the burden to allege jurisdictional facts demonstrating subject matter jurisdiction. <ital>Lindstrom v. United States</ital>, 510 F.3d 1191, 1193 (10th Cir. 2007); <ital>see also McNutt v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp. of Ind., Inc.</ital>, 298 U.S. 178, 182 (1936). &#x201C;Federal courts &#x2018;have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party,&#x2019; and thus a court may <ital>sua sponte</ital> raise the question of whether there is subject matter jurisdiction &#x2018;at any stage in the litigation.&#x2019;&#x201D; <ital>Image Software, Inc. v. Reynolds &#38; Reynolds Co.</ital>, 459 F.3d 1044, 1048 (10th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p3" level="1">The law in this Circuit has long required that, to effect proper removal based upon diversity jurisdiction, &#x201C;[b]oth the requisite amount in controversy and the existence of diversity must be affirmatively established on the face of either the petition or the removal notice.&#x201D; <ital>Laughlin v. Kmart Corp.</ital>, 50 F.3d 871, 873 (10th Cir. 1995). In addition, the Tenth Circuit has provided guidance to district courts regarding the analysis to be undertaken in determining the amount in controversy:</paratext>
<para><paratext ID="p4" first-line="1" turnover="1">The amount in controversy is ordinarily determined by the allegations of the complaint, or, where they are not dispositive, by the allegations in the notice of removal. The burden is on the party requesting removal to set forth, in the notice of removal itself, the &#x201C;<ital>underlying facts</ital> supporting [the] assertion that the amount in controversy exceeds [$75,000].&#x201D;</paratext></para>
<paratext ID="p5" contd-flag="y"><ital>Id.</ital> (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). Where the face of the initial pleading does not affirmatively establish the requisite amount in controversy, <ital>Laughlin</ital> requires that the removing defendant set forth in the notice of removal the facts supporting defendant's allegation of the requisite amount in controversy. <ital>See id.</ital> A removing defendant must &#x201C;prove those jurisdictional facts by a preponderance of the evidence,&#x201D; and once it does so, the defendant is entitled to stay in federal court unless it is &#x201C;legally certain&#x201D; that the recovery will be less than the jurisdictional amount. <ital>McPhail v. Deere &#38; Co.</ital>, 529 F.3d 947, 955 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting <ital>Meridian Security Ins. Co. v. Sadowski</ital>, 441 F.3d 536, 543 (7th Cir. 2006)).</paratext></para>
<para><paratext ID="p6" level="1">Plaintiff's Petition does not contain a demand for more than $75,000. Instead, it recites plaintiffs' request for &#x201C;in excess of $10,000, attorney fees, costs, and such other relief which may be equitable and just.&#x201D; (Doc. 2-1, at 2). Pursuant to applicable law, that demand &#x201C;shall be deemed to be the amount in controversy&#x201D;, unless the defendant has properly asserted the amount in controversy in the Notice of Removal and this Court &#x201C;finds, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds [$75,000].&#x201D; <ital>See</ital> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1446(c)(2). Here, the Notice of Removal states only that it is unclear whether the plaintiff seeks more than $75,000. That does not provide the Court any basis to make a finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. <ital>See, e.g., Herndon v. American Commerce Ins. Co.</ital>, 651 F. Supp. 2d 1266, 1271-73 (N.D. Okla. 2009) (defendant's minimal analysis was insufficient to prove the amount in controversy facts); <ital>Saffle v. Oil Field Pipe &#38; Supply, Inc.</ital>, No. 09-CV-327-CVE-PJC, 2009 WL 1606519 (N.D. Okla. June 8, 2009) (<ital>sua sponte</ital> remand because initial pleading did not provide basis for removal and defendant's notice of removal merely alleged &#x201C;on information and belief&#x201D; that the plaintiffs sought damages in excess of $75,000). Thus, subject matter jurisdiction has not been established, and remand is proper. <ital>See</ital> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1447(c).</paratext></para>
