<body>
<p>In structures with missing/null/implicit objects, the information provided by the phonetic form of a sentence does not correspond to the selectional requirements of the verb whose internal argument cannot be identified in the overt string, but is strongly implied (e.g. <italic>Iam reading &#x00F8; </italic>implies <italic>I am reading stuff). </italic>In this work, I explore aspects of structures with missing direct objects, focusing on their syntax and some interactions between syntax and the lexicon, syntax and semantics, and syntax and morphology. The discussion here is limited to structures with verbs which select for nominal ((e)-type) objects. Other types of objects pose numerous additional questions which still await resolving in theoretical research even when the object is overt. Only accusative objects are included here to eliminate the potential influence of the syntax and semantics of oblique case on object drop, which constitutes an interesting topic for further research.</p>
<p>In the theoretical analysis which I develop here, I aim at contributing to the on-going inquiry into the derivation of structures with missing objects and into</p>
<p>the parameters of variation in this area. This is a necessary step in deepening our understanding of the phenomenon of null arguments in natural language grammar. The main hypothesis which I offer here is that missing objects are represented in the syntax minimally as the nominalising head <italic>n </italic>and maximally as full pronouns. I treat cross-linguistic variation and similarities observed with respect to the constraints on missing objects as resulting from an interplay between the language-specific lexical specifications of the <italic>n </italic>heads and their language-internal morphosyntactic realisation, as well as from the mechanisms of interpretation of argumental phrases available in different languages.</p>
<p>The discussion of the empirical material pertains mainly to English (Indo-European, West Germanic), Polish (Indo-European, Slavic), and Hungarian (Uralic, Finno-Ugric), in the hope that comparing and contrasting these languages can be conducive to isolating some features of the grammar which regulate the availability of missing objects in natural language. The data come from linguistic literature, from corpora, and from native-speaker judgments of constructed examples. The judgments of the Polish examples are primarily mine, but have been checked with other native speakers. I have gathered the judgments of examples from other languages studied here over the past couple of years, consulting different speakers at different times. I provide the relevant information in footnotes accompanying the examples.</p>

<title>Comparing and contrasting English, Polish, and Hungarian</title>
<p>Different languages impose different restrictions on the use of missing objects. At the same time, data from language acquisition have been taken to suggest that the non-realisation of an object is an option widely available at least in early stages of language development, even when the adult language severely restricts object drop (see, e.g., P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux, Pirvulescu &#x0026; Roberge 2008; P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux, Pirvulescu, Roberge &#x0026; Castilla 2013). Thus, comparing and contrasting how typologically different languages restrict object drop can not only provide important indicators about the nature of missing objects, but it can also help deduce the relevant components of the initial state. Investigating what features of the grammar contribute to restricting object drop in particular languages and what features of the grammar can help bypass these restrictions is a crucial step towards developing theories of argument drop. Proper understanding of both the licensing and the blocking factors is necessary if theories of missing objects are to be complete.</p>
<p>Due to numerous differences in the grammatical systems of English, Polish, and Hungarian crosscutting at various points relevant to argument realisation, these languages provide interesting material for the present research goal. For example, both English and Hungarian have articles, indicating that their referen-xiv</p>
<p>tial arguments typically project DP structures. On the other hand, Polish lacks articles, making the hypothesis that referential arguments need not be DPs worth entertaining (see, a.o., Corver 1990; Chierchia 1998; Willim 2000; Bo&#x0161;kovi&#x0107; 2008, 2012 and references therein). Furthermore, Polish, but not English and Hungarian, is a language with a grammatical gender system, and Hungarian, but not English and Polish, has a conjugational system sensitive to the presence and the features of the object. The variety of environments in which object drop is available and restricted in these languages is a function of the combination of the components of the initial state and the differences in the individual adult grammars. Investigating the relevant points of variation and similarity can thus not only inform theories of missing objects, but it also has the potential to contribute to theories of linguistic variation in general.</p>

<title>Structure of the current work</title>
<p>This book consists of two parts. Part 1 offers a novel theoretical contribution, focusing on the theory of the representation of missing objects in the context of linguistic variation. Part 2 is driven by the need to systematise the highly complex set of empirical facts and analytical approaches scattered in the literature over the past decades and emerging from some new corpus data.</p>
<p>xv</p>
<p>The empirical picture of object drop in Hungarian which emerges from the literature provides a solid basis for its theoretical analysis. It is clear that Hungarian makes available both non-anaphoric and anaphoric indefinite and definite missing objects. The property of object drop in Hungarian which is most relevant to syntactic analyses is the restriction on definite object drop imposed by the number (and person) feature of the object. In particular, third-person definite objects can be dropped in Hungarian only when they are singular. To add to the mystery, first-person and second-person objects can be dropped both when they are singular and when they are plural, even though the judgments are somewhat degraded in the latter case. Accounting for these asymmetries forms a significant component of the theoretical approach to object drop which I develop in part 1, especially in chapter 3. In brief, I propose there that the facts follow from the internal structure of pronominal projections in Hungarian and from the way in which heads of these projections are interpreted at the syntax-morphology (SM) interface.</p>
<p>The picture of the availability of missing objects in English and Polish is somewhat less clear than in Hungarian. This pertains to definite objects, as well as to factors influencing unspecified object drop, such as rich specification of the manner in which an action is performed. The corpus data gathered for the purpose of this study show that anaphoric object drop is productive also in English</p>
<p>xvi</p>
<p>and Polish and that non-anaphoric objects have a wider spectrum of possible interpretations than has so far frequently been taken to be the case. Unlike what could be expected based on some previous studies, rich manner specification contributes to restricting rather than to licensing unspecified object drop. I capture this observation with the generalisation in (1) in section 1.2 of chapter 1.</p>
<list id="q_1" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(1)</label><p><italic>Manner specification generalisation	</italic>[parametrisable]</p>
<p>If a verb makes object drop available, its near synonym with a more specific manner component tends to block it.</p>
<p>In addition to contradicting some intuitions presented in the literature on the licensing of indefinite missing objects, data leading to the generalisation in (1) show that the influence of rich manner specification, familiar from its effects on grammatical processes such as <italic>that-</italic>deletion, is also relevant to object drop.</p>
<p>Discussing the empirical facts in part 1 and 2, I also show that definite missing objects are more flexible than overt pronouns in terms of interpretation both in English and in Polish, even though this is not so in Hungarian. I take this observation into consideration in the theoretical analysis in part 1. I propose that definite missing objects in Hungarian are composed with the same interpretable heads as overt pronouns, but such objects are structurally smaller than overt pronouns</p>
<p>xvii</p>
<p>in English and Polish. Definite interpretation of the missing object is achieved via mediation of the D head in Hungarian, but it results from the application of the type-shifting <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>operation in the semantics in English and Polish. The main purpose of part 1 of the book is to offer a novel theory of the representation of missing objects. This includes not only definite object drop, which I discuss in detail in chapter 3, but also indefinite object drop. As indefinite missing objects behave in parallel in English, Polish, and Hungarian, I offer a uniform analysis of indefinite object drop in the three languages in chapter 2. The syntactic representation which I postulate for these objects is <italic>n</italic>, where <italic>n </italic>is a nominalising head which is not accompanied by a root. I take this head to have a denotation of type <italic>&#x27E8;</italic>e,t<italic>&#x27E9; </italic>and to be interpreted in this context via the same mechanism which is used for interpretation of bare mass nouns. I support this proposal with the observation that indefinite missing objects and bare mass nouns share two important interpretive properties: they do not impose restrictions on the numerosity of the entities in their extension and they always take narrow scope (in English). Before I provide a detailed discussion of this part of the analysis of missing objects in chapter 2, in chapter 1 I outline some background assumptions and more general motivations for the type of analysis which I offer.</p>
<p>Although the empirical focus here is on English, Polish, and Hungarian, my larger goal is to provide a framework for deriving cross-linguistic and intra-xviii</p>
<p>linguistic variation in the domain of object drop. I hypothesise that variation of this type follows, first and foremost, from the association of heads in the extended nominal projection with phonemic features and from the system of interpretation of nominal phrases in a language. Both of these components are available to the child in primary linguistic data, which means that no additional elements need to be introduced to the theory of UG to account specifically for facts related to missing arguments. I discuss such broader issues of language variation and language acquisition in the concluding chapter.</p>
<p>Drawing on selected previous literature as well as on data from linguistic corpora, part 2 discusses various additional aspects of missing objects. The main aim is to clarify what has been learned so far and to provide some critical background on the broader spectrum of issues and analyses discussed in the literature on the topic, which are not of primary importance to the proposal developed in part 1, but which can serve as a basis for future studies. This part includes two chapters. Chapter 4 is concerned with the features of the object which are most salient in distinguishing the basic types of missing objects, namely their anaphoricity and definiteness. I also discuss here different types of approaches to the analysis of structures with missing objects, including analyses taking these structures to be intransitive, analyses postulating the syntactic projection of the object, and the approach equating these structures with antipassives.</p>
<p>xix</p>
<p>In chapter 5, the discussion shifts to the influence of some features of the verb and the predicate/sentence on object drop. This includes verbal selectional restrictions, the manner and result components of verb meaning, as well as issues related to the interaction of object drop with <italic>aktionsart</italic>, telicity, and grammatical aspect. In this chapter, I also consider additional features of the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic environment which license missing objects, including habituality, genericity, iterativity, and factors such as contrast. The purpose of reviewing these broader properties of structures with missing objects is to provide a comprehensive description of the phenomenon and a critical assessment of some previous analytical ideas, with a view to facilitating further linguistic variation research and theoretical debate.</p>

<title>Missing objects in English, Polish, and Hungarian: developing a theoretical analysis</title>
</title-group>
</book-part-meta>
<body>
<p>In part 1 of this work, I offer a novel analysis of indefinite and definite missing objects, with a view to accounting for data from English, Polish, and Hungarian and for the variation among these languages. At the same time, I explicate how this analysis can be applied to other languages to derive variation observed in the domain of argument drop. I begin in the present chapter by discussing some general issues. In section 1.1, I first provide a brief overview of some influential analyses of argument drop proposed earlier. I also present arguments against</p>
<p>adopting these analyses for the present purpose and argue for a novel approach. In section 1.2, I then focus on the hypothesis that at least with respect to English, the availability of object drop has to be encoded in verbal lexical entries. I agree that this approach seems to be well-motivated for definite missing objects, but I disagree that it is viable for indefinite missing objects. I discuss this issue in relation to rich specification of the manner of action in verbal meaning, offering a generalisation that rich manner specification tends to block object drop in the more specific of two nearly synonymous verbs.</p>
<p>In section 1.3, I move to presenting an overview of the data which guide the analysis in chapters 2 and 3. I conclude that: (a) indefinite object drop in English, Polish, and Hungarian involves the same mechanism; (b) specialised interpretations available with non-anaphoric missing objects should be accounted for within the domain of pragmatics and world knowledge; (c) the obligatory narrow scope of indefinite missing objects is not a strong argument for treating them as involving intransitive structures; (d) definite object drop involves different derivational paths in different languages; (e) as definite missing objects can participate in variable binding, they need to be analysed as involving transitive verbs; (f) definite missing objects and overt pronouns are not represented in the same way in English and Polish.</p>
<p>In section 1.4, I summarise some basic assumptions and features of the analy-3</p>
<p>sis, elaborating on the aspects of the current grammatical theory within the minimalist framework on which I build. A more detailed discussion of indefinite missing objects is then offered in chapter 2, which is followed by a discussion of definite missing objects in chapter 3.</p>
</sec1>

<label>1.1</label>
<title>Modelling missing objects: previous approaches</title>
<p>In the chapters which follow, I focus on modelling the syntax of structures with missing objects, with some relevant discussion of the lexical components of verb meaning and the issues that arise as a result at the interfaces between syntax and semantics and syntax and morphology. The approach which I offer here has as one of its main goals an account of the observed cross-linguistic variation while not adding complexity to the theory of UG. Parsimony and simplicity are the overarching methodological principles that constrain syntactic theorising. This is why the analysis utilises elements of grammatical theory which have been posited on independent grounds and is not based on special null lexical items and special licensing conditions.</p>
<p>Several analytical options have been explored in the literature aiming to account for various types of structures with missing objects in different languages. These options include the types of analyses listed below, where I also provide</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>arguments why I do not adopt them in the present work.<sup>1</sup></p>
</sec2>
<sec2>
<label>1.1.1</label>
<title>Structures with missing objects are unergative</title>
<p>This approach, illustrated with (1) below, applies to non-anaphoric/indefinite objects (see, e.g., Bresnan 1978; Fodor &#x0026; Fodor 1980; Jackendoff 1990).</p>
<list id="q_1" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(1)</label><p>Idrank<sub>[INTR]</sub>.</p>
<p>Treating structures of this type as unergative accounts for the obligatory narrow scope of the object. In particular, even though the quantifier <italic>something </italic>and indefinite noun phrases can sometimes take wide scope with respect to quantifiers merged higher in the structure, indefinite missing objects are restricted to narrow-scope readings, as shown in (2) from Fodor &#x0026; Fodor (1980:759) and in (3) from Williams (2015:105).</p>
<list id="q_2" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(2)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_2a"><label>a.</label><p>Everybody ate something. b. Everybody ate &#x00F8;.</p>
<list id="q_3" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(3)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_3a"><label>a.</label><p>Every boy stole a book from exactly three girls.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Exactly three students baked &#x00F8; this morning.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Most of the proposals listed in sections 1.1.1&#x2013;1.1.9 have been put forward to account for data from languages other than English and the examples in (1)&#x2013;(31) are used only for the purpose of illustration.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>In (2), only the (a) example allows the wide-scope reading of <italic>something, </italic>while (2b) does not entail that there was some specific thing x such that everyone ate x. Similarly, (3a) has the interpretation on which the indefinite <italic>exactly three girls </italic>scopes over the quantifier <italic>every boy, </italic>but (3b) cannot be interpreted to mean that there is some specific thing x such that x was baked by exactly three students.</p>
<p>Even though the scopal facts have been used to support the intransitive approach to the structure with missing objects (see esp. Bresnan 1978; Fodor &#x0026; Fodor 1980), the data are also amenable to a different interpretation. In particular, as pointed out in Carlson (1977:15-21), overt bare plurals in English can only take narrow scope, differing in this way from both singular and plural indefinites (see also Dayal 2011 for a discussion):</p>
<list id="q_4" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(4)</label><p>Miles wants to meet a/some/sm policeman.</p>
<p><sc>can mean: </sc>(3x)(Policeman(x) &#x0026; Miles want (Miles meet x)) <sc>can mean: </sc>Miles want ((3x)(Policeman(x) &#x0026; Miles meet x))</p>
<list id="q_5" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(5)</label><p>Miles wants to meet policemen.</p>
<p><sc>cannot mean: </sc>(3x)(Policemen(x) &#x0026; Miles want (Miles meet x)) <sc>can mean: </sc>Miles want ((3x)(Policemen(x) &#x0026; Miles meet x))</p>
<p>Parallel facts hold of other contexts, such as negated statements, as illustrated in</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>(6), quoted here after Dayal (2011:1089).</p>
<list id="q_6" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(6)</label><p>Miles didn&#x2019;t see policemen/a policeman/some policemen.</p>
<p>Mass nouns share this property with bare plurals (Carlson 1977:462&#x2013;464), as shown in (7), for which my informants can access only the narrow-scope reading of <italic>whisky</italic>.<sup>2</sup></p>
<list id="q_7" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(7)</label><p>Miles didn&#x2019;t drink/always drinks whisky.</p>
<p>This interpretive property of bare plurals and mass nouns cannot plausibly be taken to imply that whenever a bare plural or a mass noun is used as an object, the verb is in fact intransitive. Thus, even though an intransitive analysis is sufficient to capture the scopal facts related to missing objects, another option to pursue is to assume that the unpronounced internal argument shares a certain property with bare plurals and mass nouns and it is this property which is responsible for the scopal behaviour of all three kinds of nominal elements.</p>
<p>An additional point of relevance is that the unergative analysis requires either lexical ambiguity (transitive and intransitive lexemes) or an (in)transitivisation</p>
<p>operation whose output is a lexeme with reduced valence or increased valence,</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Thanks go to Jeffrey Green, William Matchin, and Laurel Perkins for providing me with the judgments regarding this example.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>depending on whether the transitive or the intransitive variant is considered basic. Additional mechanisms should be added to the theory only if the available mechanisms cannot derive the relevant data. The aim of chapter 2 is to show that indefinite object drop can receive an adequate account if structures with object drop are both semantically and syntactically transitive.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2>
<label>1.1.2</label>
<title>Missing objects are null variables bound by a null topic</title>
<p>The example in (8), based on Huang (1982, 1984), illustrates the approach which takes the missing object to be a variable (see also Raposo 1986 for a modification).</p>
<list id="q_8" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(8)</label><p>[<sub>Top</sub> &#x00F8;<sub>i</sub>]Idrank &#x00F8;<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p>This analysis accounts for the interpretation of definite objects and for their island sensitivity in languages such as European Portuguese (Raposo 1986). However, object drop in English, Polish, and Hungarian is not sensitive to islands, as (9)&#x2013; (13) demonstrate.<sup>3</sup></p>

<title>Missing objects are null pronouns linked to a projection in the left periphery</title>

<p>This analysis has been developed specifically to account for topic drop in languages such as Icelandic, where topical elements, including objects, can be null on condition that there is no overt element in Spec,C, making this position available to the null element (see (14a)). Object drop in English, Polish, and Hungarian is not constrained in this way (e.g. <italic>When did you call &#x00F8;?</italic>). Another way for a</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>language to have definite missing arguments on Sigur&#x00F0;sson&#x2019;s proposal is to lack lexical C elements. Sigur&#x00F0;sson takes this to be the case in Mandarin. In this case the null argument does not need to move to the C domain to successfully match {CLn}, as (14b) illustrates. Having lexical C items (e.g. <italic>that/&#x017C;e/hogy</italic>), the three languages discussed here do not fulfil this requirement either.</p>
<p><italic>1.1.4 Missing objects are </italic>pro</p>
<p>The example in (15) shows a missing object represented as <italic>pro </italic>(cf., e.g., Rizzi 1986; Farkas 1987; Cummins &#x0026; Roberge 2005).</p>
<list id="q_15" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(15)</label><p>I drank <italic>pro</italic>.</p>
<p>As <italic>pro </italic>has the features [<italic>&#x00B1;</italic>anaphoric] and [<italic>&#x00B1;</italic>pronominal] in its matrix, this analysis is unavailable outside GB, as discussed in Sigur&#x00F0;sson (2011). Additionally, it is unclear what identification conditions on <italic>pro </italic>could derive the facts of interest here. For example, within the system proposed in Rizzi (1986), <italic>pro </italic>can be identified by rich inflection or can be assigned the index <italic>arb</italic>. In such a case it is necessarily interpreted as arbitrary and as human. The former is not an option in languages lacking object-verb agreement. The latter cannot account for cases of definite object drop and for indefinite objects which are not interpreted as human. Furthermore, adopting the <italic>pro</italic>-based approach would be problematic in the</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>light of the fact that missing objects discussed here are not exactly parallel to overt pronouns in terms of interpretation. For example, definite missing objects seem to differ from pronouns with respect to the Principle B effect, as (16), adapted from Cote (1996:126&#x2013;127), illustrates.</p>
<list id="q_16" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(16)</label><p>A: Did Mary get in trouble at school yesterday?</p>
<p>B: Yes, I saw her today and she said that it was terrible. She said that usually her teacher talks to her about problems with other students but that that evening...</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_a"><label>a.</label><p>*he called her<sub>i</sub> about her<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>he called &#x00F8;<sub>i</sub> about her<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p>Similarly, Pedersen (2011:167) notes that in examples such as (17) focus can ameliorate Principle B violation for the missing object completely, but not for the overt pronoun.</p>
<list id="q_17" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(17)</label><p>Everyone seems to be calling John to congratulate him on his new baby.</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_a"><label>a.</label><p>?Mary called him, Sue called him, and I think that even HE called</p>
<p>him.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Mary called &#x00F8;, Sue called &#x00F8;, and I think that even HE called &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Missing objects in English are thus more flexible than pronouns as far as the interpretive mechanisms are concerned. This has also been observed for sentences with the verb <italic>win. </italic>Whereas the overt pronominal object is interpreted with reference to a salient entity even when it is not suitable in a given context, a missing object invites some effort on the part of the addressee to arrive at a suitable interpretation. Williams (2012:137) illustrates this observation with the following context, where (18a) is likely to trigger a response such as (18b), but where (18c) is more likely to be followed by (18d):</p>
<list id="q_18" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>c.	I went to the faculty meeting and won &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>d.	Do you play some sort of game at your meetings?</p>
<p>The corpus example in (19), featuring three missing objects, illustrates this effect for Polish.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>In this sequence the first and the third missing object is interpreted as someone with a phone based on preceding discourse, but the second missing object is interpreted as a phone. This shows that anaphoric null objects do not need to be interpreted with reference to an established topic and need not continue to have the same interpretation when appearing in a sequence.<sup>5</sup> In this respect, missing objects are again more flexible in terms of interpretation than overt pronominals. The sentence sequence in (20), where the missing objects are substituted with pronominal clitics, is not well formed. The second pronominal clitic, that is the object of the verb <italic>commandeer, </italic>needs to be interpreted here in the same way as the preceding clitic, that is as a person with a phone, an unlikely scenario.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>This suggests that the mechanisms proposed for the interpretation of null arguments within the cartographic approach, for example, in Frascarelli (2007) and Sigur&#x00F0;sson (2011), which rely on a matching relation between the null argument and a topic in the left periphery of the clause, cannot account for the present data. See also Pinto (2013) for a discussion of some Italian data with null subjects which seem problematic for Frascarelli&#x2019;s approach.</p>

<p>Since the only difference between <italic>pro </italic>and overt pronouns predicted within the GB-theoretic model is in realisation at the level of the sound system, it is unclear how the interpretive differences could be accounted for within the approach taking missing objects to be represented as <italic>pro</italic>.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><sup>6</sup>A classic example of interpretive differences between<italic>pro </italic>and overt pronouns comes from Montalbetti (1984:26):</p>
<p>(i)	a. Nadie<sub>i</sub>cree que <italic>&#x00E9;</italic>l<sub>j</sub> es inteligente.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Nobody<sub>i</sub> believes that hej is intelligent&#x2019; b. Nadiei cree que<italic>pro</italic><sub>j</sub> es inteligente.	[Spanish]</p>
<p>Whereas (ia) is unacceptable when i=j, in (ib) this interpretation is available. However, in this case, reference to overtness in its own right does not seem sufficient to explain the data, as stressing an overt pronoun can make the bound variable interpretation available (Montalbetti 1984:128, footnote 9). To the best of my knowledge, these data are still to be accounted for.</p>

<title>Missing objects are deleted full NPs/DPs</title>
<p>This type of analysis, illustrated in (21), has been adopted, among othets, in Oku (1998); Saito (2007); &#x015E;ener &#x0026; Takahashi (2010); Duguine (2014).</p>

<p>Even though there might be contexts where an analysis along these lines is plausible, merging a full argument in the structure in all cases of null arguments only to delete it does not seem to be an optimal solution in terms of the economy of derivations. It seems particularly unlikely that this analysis could account for unspecified object drop, as ellipsis seems to require an antecedent to be licensed, as shown in Hankamer &#x0026; Sag (1976). Furthermore, in Hungarian third-person plural definite objects cannot be dropped, in contrast to third-person singular objects, as (22)-(23), adapted from Farkas &#x0026; de Swart (2003:135-137), shows.</p>

<p>This approach has been inspired by some analogies between structures in which the object is null but the lexical verb is overt and VP ellipsis in English. For example, Huang (1991:64) suggests that the function performed by the repeated verb in the verb-stranding structure in Mandarin is similar to the function of <italic>do</italic>-support in English. Both serve to express tense/aspect/agreement in the elliptical clause:</p>

<p>Even though analysing missing objects via the mechanism of verb-stranding VP ellipsis is not viable for English, where the lexical verb is not taken to move</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>beyond VP (see Chomsky 1957; Emonds 1976), certain contexts lacking an overt object have been analysed in this way in Hungarian and Polish.<sup>8</sup> These contexts involve the focusing of polarity, which triggers the movement of the verb beyond VP (e.g. to the polarity-related head &#x03A3; (Laka 1990)).<sup>9</sup> These contexts include replies to polar (<italic>Yes/No</italic>) questions, verbal reactions to commands, contexts in which an assertion is confirmed or reversed, and sentences involving polar con-trast.<sup>10</sup> I illustrate the first context in (27) from Lipt&#x00E1;k (2013:73) for Hungarian</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>One exception with respect to English is constituted by the possessive <italic>have </italic>in the British variety, as illustrated in (i) from Thoms (2010:6). In American English, the possessive <italic>have </italic>does not move to T and verb-standing VP ellipsis is not available, as (ii) shows.</p>

<p>ellipsis in Hungarian and Polish.<sup>11</sup> The reason for this is that object drop in these languages is available in contexts which are not predicted to license VP ellipsis, such as contexts where the lexical material in the antecedent and the would-be ellipsis site differs (including, e.g., different verbs) and contexts in which there is no possible linguistic antecedent for the elliptical phrase, as examples throughout this work show. What is more, VP ellipsis is not predicted to be sensitive to the properties of the object such as the value of the number feature. In (27) the elliptical object is plural, but this is impossible in neutral contexts in Hungarian (see (23) above). The contexts in which only singular objects can be dropped in Hungarian are clear indicators that a different mechanism of deriving object drop in this language is needed in addition to VP ellipsis. I thus analyse contexts without focused polarity in Hungarian and Polish here in terms of genuine object drop.<sup>12</sup></p>

<label>1.1.7</label>
<title>Missing objects are the feature complex {[D], [&#x03C6;]} or {[&#x03C6;]}</title>
<p>Landau (2010) distinguishes between strong implicit arguments, represented as {[D], [&#x03C6;]}, and weak implicit argument, represented as {[&#x03C6;]}, where {[&#x03C6;]} is the set of the features of person and number (see (29)).</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>See also Raposo (1986), who suggests that European Portuguese has both verb-standing VP ellipsis and definite object drop.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Some more discussion focusing on VP ellipsis analyses of the relevant structures in the two languages is offered in Lipt&#x00E1;k (2012, 2013) and Ruda (2013a,b, 2014c).</p>
<p>21</p>
<list id="q_29" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(29)</label><p>I drank {[D], [&#x03C6;]}/{[&#x03C6;]}.</p>
<p>Only {[D], [&#x03C6;]} has the ability to bind reflexives and function as the subject of predication, but both can be controllers and binders for pronouns and R-expressions. However, this association of the relevant phenomena with the presence of the D feature does not seem to be well motivated and is problematic from the point of view of languages in which there is no evidence for the presence of the D feature/head, as I discuss in more detail in section 1.4. Furthermore, Landau (2010) proposes that null direct objects have to be strong implicit arguments ({[D], [&#x03C6;]}) based on two stipulations: (a) transitive v has to check its accusative case feature; (b) the presence of case on a noun phrase implicates the presence of D. Admitting the possibility that in some languages null direct objects can be weak implicit argument ({[&#x03C6;]}), he suggests that (a) is parametric, and that the relevant languages have a transitive v lacking the case feature. This step is problematic even within Landau&#x2019;s set of assumptions, as it is unclear why {[&#x03C6;]} should be able to function as an internal argument, but not as the subject of predication. Moreover, Landau&#x2019;s proposal is challenged by data from languages such as Italian, where arbitrary missing objects are available in both generic and episodic contexts, but can participate in control only in the former environment, as I show in section 2.4 of chapter 2.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>The proposal offered here shares some features with Landau&#x2019;s in that it takes some null objects to be DPs and some others to lack D, but it does not take for granted a universal association between the presence and absence of D and the types of relations which an argument can enter. The present hypothesis that a nominal argument can lack the case feature is also shared with the proposal put forward in Landau (2010) (see also Ruda 2014b; Dvo&#x0159;&#x00E1;k 2015).</p>

<title>Missing objects are null bare nouns</title>
<p>Treating missing objects as projections of null Ns, as illustrated in (30), has been advocated, for example, by Panagiotidis (2003); Tsimpli &#x0026; Papadopoulou (2006); P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux et al. (2008, 2013); Barbosa (2017).</p>
<list id="q_30" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(30)</label><p>I drank [<SUB>NP</SUB> &#x00F8;].</p>
<p>This approach poses the question what the null bare nouns is, especially within</p>
<p>the categoriser-based approach to the construction of lexical categories (Embick</p>
<p>&#x0026; Noyer 2007; Embick &#x0026; Marantz 2008). The null noun could be either a null</p>
<p>categoriser or a combination of a categoriser and a root.<sup>13</sup> Panagiotidis (2003)</p>
<p>takes the noun to be both null and lacking conceptual content. Adapting this ap-<sup>13</sup>Postulating that the null noun is a bare root does not seem viable, since roots, being category-less elements, should not be able to satisfy subcategorisation requirements.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>proach means that no root is present in the structure, since the function of roots is to encode conceptual content. Furthermore, Panagiotidis identifies his empty nouns as &#x201C;combinations of formal features&#x201D; (Panagiotidis 2003:415), where an elementary empty noun possibly consists solely of the nominal categorial feature (Panagiotidis 2003:418). As this is a definitional description of nominal categorisers (in contrast to roots, assumed to lack formal features), the analysis offered in this work is consistent with the way in which Panagiotidis proposes to approach the question of the representation of null arguments.</p>

<title>Missing objects are represented by the nominal categorial feature</title>
<p>The analysis illustrated in (31), where &#x2018;e&#x2019; stands for an empty position, has been proposed by Aoun &#x0026; Li (2008).</p>
<list id="q_31" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(31)</label><p>I drank [e<sub>[+D]</sub>]</p>
<p>According to Aoun &#x0026; Li (2008), the positions of missing objects contain cate-gorial features, but &#x201C;no item from the lexicon is present in the object position&#x201D; (Aoun &#x0026; Li 2008:258). However, if categorial features are not included in the lexicon, the question of where they are encoded and how they can be merged and/or selected to Initial Numeration arises. The analysis offered here differs from Aoun &#x0026; Li&#x2019;s in that it treats categorial features, qua categorising heads, as</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>lexical items (which potentially can bundle with additional features on a single head).</p>
<p>As hinted above, the approach developed here employs the nominal categorising head and thus can be treated as a natural development of the last two types of proposals. The analysis offered in the following chapters aims to specify how exactly different types of missing objects are represented and interpreted and what type of an approach can account for the cross-linguistic similarities and variation observed in this domain.</p>

<title>Lexical encoding of object drop</title>
<p>The fact that nearly synonymous verbs behave differently with respect to licensing object drop has been reiterated in the literature as an argument for specifying drop-related properties in verbal lexical entries (see Fillmore 1986 for an early proposal of this type; see Gillon 2012 for a more recent one). This seems to be the case with both indefinite and definite missing objects. The most convincing examples supporting lexical specification in the latter case relate to the behaviour of verbs of caring for specific body parts, as illustrated in (89)&#x2013;(90) from Levin (1993:34). Some other types of examples are discussed, for example, by Fillmore (1986).</p>
<p>25</p>

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_33a"><label>a.</label><p>Celia braided her hair. b. *Celia braided &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>As observed in Levin (1993), object drop is available with verbs such as <italic>brush (teeth), floss (teeth), shave (beard, legs), </italic>and <italic>wash (hands, face)</italic>, but not with verbs such as <italic>bob (hair), brush (hair), file (nails), </italic>and <italic>towel (face, hands)</italic>. As no generalisation making it possible to distinguish between these two groups seems forthcoming, I follow the literature here and take definite object drop in English to be regulated by lexical specifications of particular verbs. The situation is different in Polish and Hungarian. In Polish definite object drop is constrained by information-structural factors, whereas in Hungarian the person and number features of the object are of key relevance.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>The sentences in (34) from Rice (1988:203) exemplify the data used to support the lexical encoding approach to indefinite missing objects (see also section 5.2.2 of chapter 5 and section 2.3 of chapter 2).</p>

<p>Recently Gillon (2012) has argued for encoding indefinite object drop in verbal lexical entries by suggesting that this is the only way to account for the fact that near synonyms behave differently in this respect (e.g. <italic>read </italic>vs. <italic>peruse</italic>). However, the relevant verbs do not have exactly the same meaning. It always seems to be the case that object drop is available with the basic verb denoting a type of activity (cf. also Rice 1988). For example, the verb <italic>peruse </italic>is more semantically loaded in comparison with the neutral <italic>read</italic>, in that the former has an additional manner specification.<sup>15</sup> A similar observation holds of the remaining contrasting near synonyms quoted in the literature (e.g. (34)). Introducing information about object drop into lexical entries can derive the facts, but it misses this regularity.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>The following generalisation can be suggested to capture the data in languages with lexically restricted object drop:</p>
<p><sup>15</sup>The verb <italic>peruse </italic>is defined in the Collins Dictionary as &#x201C;read or examine with care; study; browse or read through in a leisurely way&#x201D; [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictio-nary/english/peruse].</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Resultative formation seems to follow the same pattern, as indicated by the following examples from Boas (2003:113, 114), quoted here after Croft (2012:390):</p>
<p>(i) a. Stefan ate his food up.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Stefan ate his plate clean.</p>

<p>The distinction between semantically neutral and more complex verbs, first pointed out in Rice (1988), is thus supported by the data, even though the judgments are variable, suggesting that for some speakers some types of contexts can alleviate the degrading effects of rich manner specification on object drop. In addition, the general acceptability of sentences with missing objects with the verb <italic>sip </italic>suggests that some lexical items are easier to accommodate in the structure with missing</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>objects despite their manner specification.</p>
<p>There might also be some degree of cross-linguistic variation in the acceptability of translational equivalents in this respect. As noted in N&#x00E9;meth T. (2008:47) and confirmed by my informants, both variants in the sentences in (42) can be used in an answer to the question <italic>What is S&#x00E1;ndor doing</italic>?<sup>18</sup></p>

<p>The Polish verbs <italic>po&#x017C;era&#x0107; </italic>&#x2018;gobble&#x2019; and <italic>&#x017C;&#x0142;opa&#x0107; </italic>&#x2018;swig&#x2019; are not acceptable with missing objects in this context, even though a different translational equivalent of <italic>gobble</italic>, <italic>&#x017C;re&#x0107;</italic>, does not seem excluded.</p>
<p>That the generalisation in (35) holds of pairs of near synonyms rather than relates directly to rich manner specification is indicated by the fact that verbs such as <italic>iron </italic>and <italic>sweep</italic>, which express the manner of action but which lack more neutral pairs, make object drop possible despite being quite specific in meaning.</p>
<p>As lexical entries by hypothesis contain unpredictable information, the existence of a relevant generalisation makes the lexical specification approach theo-<sup>18</sup>Thanks go to &#x00C9;va D&#x00E9;k&#x00E1;ny and Veronika Heged&#x0171;s for this judgment.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>retically unattractive in this case. Interestingly, the effect of rich manner specification on grammatical options available to more neutral verbs has also been observed for some extraction and <italic>that-</italic>deletion data in Erterschik-Shir (1977). In particular, extraction out of a <italic>that-</italic>clause complement and <italic>that-</italic>deletion are (fully) acceptable with verbs such as <italic>say, tell, report, </italic>and <italic>announce</italic>, but not with verbs of manner of speaking (e.g. <italic>murmur, mumble, lisp</italic>). The sentences in (43) from Erterschik-Shir (1977:103) exemplify the latter pattern. Extraction has been tested by Erterschik-Shir (1977) with sentences of the type <italic>What did you V ((to) them) that he had done?</italic></p>
<list id="q_43" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(43)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_43a"><label>a.</label><p>He said John did it.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>*He mumbled John did it.</p>
<p>According to Erterschik-Shir (1977), what distinguishes the two verb types is semantic complexity.<sup>19</sup> With the more complex verbs (i.e. <italic>mumble</italic>), the embedded clause is interpreted as presupposed.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup>19</sup>One of the tests to distinguish verbs which are semantic primitives from the more complex ones (attributed to Haj Ross) is illustrated in (i) from Erterschik-Shir (1977:20) (the complex verb must precede the semantically primitive one).</p>
<p>(i) a. Tomumbleistosay. b. *To say is to mumble.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Erterschik-Shir (1977:27) argues for the following hypothesis: &#x201C;extraction can occur only out of clauses or phrases which can be considered dominant in some context,&#x201D; where a &#x201C;clause or phrase is semantically dominant if it is not presupposed and does not have contextual reference&#x201D;</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>These data show that there is another area of the grammar where the addition of manner specification to a semantically primitive verb plays a role. If Erterschik-Shir (1977) is right in treating the manner-of-speaking data in terms of pragmatics, this indicates that the effect observed with verbs of manner of writing, etc. and object drop is likewise attributable to pragmatics. In this connection, according to Rice (1988), the influence of detailed manner specification on object omission might be related to the additional degree of specificity, due to which the default interpretation associated with the object is disfavoured. I follow this line of reasoning and take the generalisation in (35) to be a pragmatic</p>
<p>effect.</p>
<p>(Erterschik-Shir 1977:22). Among the tests used to distinguish between the dominant and nondominant interpretation of the complement is the <italic>lie</italic>-test, showing that the complement is easily interpreted as dominant with <italic>say</italic>, odd as dominant with <italic>mumble</italic>, and impossible as dominant with <italic>editorialize </italic>(Erterschik-Shir 1977:18, 14, 16):</p>

<p>The gradient judgments here parallel the effect of manner specification on object drop, different verbs sometimes differing in how acceptable they are to speakers in the structure with object drop. This strengthens the parallel between the effect of manner on different grammatical phenomena.</p>

<title>Present analysis: conclusions from the data</title>
<p>The theoretical proposal developed here is guided by the observations provided directly below. Here I discuss only these aspects of the data which are of direct relevance to the proposal. I offer a more detailed discussion of the empirical picture of object drop in English, Polish, and Hungarian in part 2.</p>
<p><italic><bold>Observation: </bold></italic>the basic pattern of indefinite object drop is the same in English, Polish, and Hungarian, as illustrated in (44).</p>
<list id="q_44" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(44)</label><p>

<p>&#x2018;I baked the entire afternoon.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p><italic><bold>Conclusion: </bold></italic>In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I take this pattern to involve the same representation and interpretive mechanisms in all three languages.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><italic><bold>Observation: </bold></italic>The interpretation of non-anaphoric objects can be influenced by various components of the sentence, the extra-linguistic situation, and world knowledge (e.g. the object in (45), adapted from Bobrowski (1981:100&#x2013;102), can be interpreted as bribes, drugs, or bait respectively). Furthermore, specialised interpretations arise also with intransitive verbs, as illustrated with the examples in (46), which pertain to running for sport rather than to running in general.<sup>21</sup></p>

<p>&#x2018;Mum, did you run this morning?&#x2019;	[Hungarian]</p>
<p><italic><bold>Conclusion: </bold></italic>Specialised types of interpretations which non-anaphoric</p>
<p>missing objects receive can be attributed to the inferencing procedures at <sup>21</sup>The Hungarian example in (46c) comes from an internet search.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>the C-I interface. I thus treat them here as belonging to the domain of pragmatics and world knowledge. A different possibility, that is encoding the available interpretations in the lexicon, is less desirable theoretically, as it requires a significant expansion of the lexicon (see also section 4.2.1 of chapter 4). It should thus be considered only if future research shows that the pragmatic inferencing procedures cannot account for the data.</p>
<p><italic><bold>Observation: </bold></italic>Obligatory narrow scope is not specific to indefinite missing objects (e.g. (47)), but it is observed also with some types of overt objects.</p>
<list id="q_47" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(47)</label><p>

<list-item id="q_48a"><label>a.</label><p>Miles didn&#x2019;t see/is looking for policemen. b. Miles didn&#x2019;t drink/always drinks whisky.</p>
<p><italic><bold>Conclusion: </bold></italic>The scopal property of missing objects does not necessarily constitute an argument in favour of the intransitive analysis of the relevant verbs, but can follow from some properties of the unpronounced internal argument shared with bare plurals and mass nouns.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><italic><bold>Observation: </bold></italic>The set of licensing and blocking factors for definite object drop differs between different languages, in contrast to indefinite object drop.</p>
<p><italic><bold>Conclusion: </bold></italic>Even though indefinite object drop utilises features of the grammar shared by different languages, developing an analysis of definite object drop requires taking more fine-grained differences between their grammars into account.</p>
<p><italic><bold>Observation: </bold></italic>Definite missing objects can be interpreted as bound variables in English (see section 4.3 and 4.5 of chapter 4 for discussion).</p>
<list id="q_49" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(49)</label><p>Every man is worried that his wife will call &#x00F8; while his mistress is visiting &#x00F8;.</p>
<p><italic><bold>Conclusion: </bold></italic>Verbs in structures of this type are transitive (the internal argument variable has to be available to be bound in semantics).</p>
<p><italic><bold>Observation: </bold></italic>In English and Polish definite missing objects are more flexible in terms of interpretation than overt pronouns (see, e.g., (50)).<sup>22 22</sup>The situation is different in Hungarian, as I discuss in section 3.3.3 of chapter 3.</p>

<title>Present analysis: basic assumptions</title>
<p>The development of the theory of the syntactic representation of noun phrases has lead to the decompositional approach, on which traditional NPs contain a number of separate projections encoding the non-intrinsic, grammatical properties of nouns, such as number, as discussed, for example, in Alexiadou, Haegeman &#x0026; Stavrou (2007). Also grammatical categories have been hypothesised to be determined in the narrow syntax with different sets of functional heads (Embick &#x0026; Noyer 2007; Embick &#x0026; Marantz 2008). These developments in syntactic theory since the research within GB raise the question about the more fine-grained structure of null arguments, as the space of possibilities is expanded by the number of the nominal heads, each of which can in principle be absent from the representation of an argument. Guided by this logic, in what follows, I suggest that missing objects are minimally represented as the nominalising head <italic>n </italic>and maximally as structures containing all postulated (interpretable) nominal heads, that is [<SUB>DP</SUB> D [<sub>PersP</sub> Pers [<sub>NumP</sub> Num [<sub><italic>n</italic>P</sub> <italic>n</italic>]]]].<sub>23</sub></p>
<p>On this approach, a structurally minimal missing object is thus similar to bare</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Analysing null arguments as null pronouns has a long tradition in generative theorising (see, esp., Chomsky 1981, 1982; Rizzi 1982, 1986). Elliptical arguments/NPs have been analysed in terms of <italic>n </italic>in Ruda (2014b) (object drop in the recipe register), Ruda (2014a) (impersonal subjects in the so-called <italic>-no/to </italic>construction in Polish), Dvo&#x0159;&#x00E1;k (2015) (generic null objects in Czech), Ruda (2016) (NP ellipsis with NP-internal remnants), Barbosa (2017) (null subjects), and Ruda (forthcoming) (definite missing objects in English).</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>NP arguments familiar from discussions of languages such as Japanese. As (52) from Tomioka (2003:328) illustrates, a bare number-unmarked noun can be an argument and as such can receive different interpretations along the definite/indefinite (plus indefinite specific/indefinite non-specific) distinction and along the singular/plural distinction.</p>

<p>Here, I adopt the view that the representation of natural language arguments can lack the number head/feature and the D head.</p>
<p>The latter hypothesis has sparked some controversy in the literature (for related discussions, see, e.g., Corver 1990; Longobardi 1994; Chierchia 1998; Pro-govac 1998; Willim 2000; Rutkowski 2002; Bo&#x0161;kovi&#x0107; 2008, 2012; Jiang 2012; Fanselow&#x0026; F&#x00E9;ry 2013; Pereltsvaig 2013). From the empirical perspective, some of the phenomena used in the literature to support the hypothesis that languages can lack the DP layer include the (un)availability of two genitive-marked arguments in NPs (Willim 2000), the (unavailability of extraction of complements from noun phrases, Japanese-type scrambling, superiority effects, the obligatoriness of number morphology (Bo&#x0161;kovi&#x0107; 2008, 2012), and the behaviour of nomi-</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>nals in classifier languages (Jiang 2012). From the theoretical perspective, within systems where levels such as D&#x2019; and DP (in traditional terms) are projections of lexical items, including the minimalist system with its Bare Phrase Structure approach to projection, D is a label used for the sake of convenience to refer to items such as the article <italic>the</italic>. As in (at least some of the) languages lacking articles there is no evidence which could lead the learner to postulate a null D head (see, e.g., Willim 2000), D in the structure of arguments would presumably have to be included in UG, as a syntactic head is not a likely candidate for a third-factor deduction. This is not necessary on the alternative view, on which the postulation of D by the language learner is triggered by the input when the language being acquired has articles, allowing UG to contain only the elements that are not learnable and that are not related to the third factor in language design (Chomsky 2005).<sup>24</sup></p>
<p>The availability of different representations of missing arguments in different languages must be inferable from the primary linguistic data, in combination with</p>
<p>elements made available in UG. This is why the analysis proposed here is guided</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>Interestingly, even the more basic hypothesis that D ever is the head of noun phrases (i.e. the DP Hypothesis) has been challenged on theoretical and empirical grounds, for example, in Bruening (2009), who argues that the head of the noun phrase universally is <italic>n </italic>and that articles, demonstratives, adjectives, etc. occupy Spec,<italic>n</italic>P positions. The analysis offered in this work could be restated in these terms.</p>
<p>If future research shows that natural language arguments require D, the proposal offered here will need to be reconsidered from this point of view. See section 3.3.4 of chapter 3 for some more discussion.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>by the view that the initial state of the grammar includes <italic>n</italic>, whose use as a missing argument is constrained by various language-specific factors.</p>

<title>Indefinite missing objects</title>
</title-group>

<body>
<p>In this chapter, I explore the approach to deriving structures with indefinite missing objects which takes these structures to involve a projection of the object in the syntactic component. The main hypothesis that I put forward here in the light of the discussion in the previous chapter is that the object is represented as the nominal categorising head <italic>n </italic>which is not merged with a lexical root. This solution ensures the satisfaction of c-selectional requirements of the verb without additional assumptions and is corroborated by some observations made with respect to the potential of indefinite missing arguments to license sluicing.</p>
<p>Following some remarks concerning the relevance of sluicing data to the issue of transitivity of structures with indefinite object drop in section 2.1, I discuss the analysis in detail in section 2.2. In section 2.2.1, I focus on the problem of</p>
<p>the lack of phonemic realisation of the object represented syntactically and I discuss the semantic interpretation of the object in section 2.2.2. I suggest here that the lack of realisation of the object at the level of the sound system follows from the feature content of the <italic>n </italic>head and its association with phonemic material in a language. I propose that the <italic>n </italic>head is an <italic>&#x27E8;</italic>e,t<italic>&#x27E9;</italic>-type element and that its interpretation in the contexts with indefinite missing objects parallels the interpretation of mass nouns. I point to the operation Restrict (Chung &#x0026; Ladusaw 2004) as one possible option to employ. In section 2.2.3, I briefly discuss the relation between indefinite missing objects and incorporated structures, suggesting that equating the two does not seem to be a viable option. In section 2.2.4, I consider the issue of the syntactic activity of the object. I show that English and Hungarian arbitrary missing objects cannot participate in control, unlike arbitrary missing objects in Polish.</p>
<p>In section 2.3, the discussion shifts to the relation between indefinite object drop and the manner and result components of verb meaning. I argue here that the hypotheses that unspecified object drop is licensed with manner verbs and that it is blocked with result verbs are both empirically inadequate.</p>
<p>Based on data from Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Mandarin, and Polish, in section 2.4.1 I briefly show that the availability of control in structures with arbitrary missing objects presents a more complex problem</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>than what could be expected on the assumption of a simple correlation between the presence of the object in the syntax and its ability to control.</p>
<p>In section 2.4.2,I illustrate some further aspects of language variation in the domain of indefinite object drop. In particular, rather than dropping an unspecified object with verbs such as <italic>read </italic>(i.e. <italic>read&#x00F8;), </italic>languages such as Mandarin use a (semi-)pleonastic nominal object (e.g. <italic>kan-shu </italic>&#x2018;read-book&#x2019;). I discuss some initial data from Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin, showing that the empirical picture of the contrast between missing objects and (semi-)pleonastic nominals is not as clear-cut as some previous literature suggests. This indicates a need for a finer-grained investigation taking into account the dimension of variation between verbs in a single language.</p>

<title>A transitive analysis of indefinite object drop</title>
<p>As (1) from AnderBois (2012:45) shows, indefinite missing objects license sluicing.<sup>1</sup></p>
<list id="q_1" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(1)</label><p>Fred baked &#x00F8;, and Lucinda&#x2019;s going to find out what.</p>
<p>The fact that clauses with missing objects can license sluicing raises questions</p>
<p>1The ability to license sluicing has been used as a test to determine whether the missing object is definite or indefinite. See section 4.1 of chapter 4 for some more discussion.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>about the parallelism conditions required for this type of ellipsis to be acceptable. On the assumption that the missing object is represented syntactically the sluicing data pose no additional difficulties, as the antecedent and the sluiced clause are parallel both in the syntax and in the semantics.<sup>2</sup> On the approach taking the missing object not to be represented syntactically or not to be represented syntactically and semantically, analyses of sluicing need to account for the lack of syntactic (and semantic) parallelism in these structures. This type of analysis might of course be required regardless of the treatment of data with missing objects (see Merchant 1999), but some effects observed with missing arguments in double object structures seem to speak against this view. As noticed in Gillon (2012:321&#x2013;322), in structures with implicit arguments the choice of the antecedent in sluicing determines the choice of the interrogative expression:</p>
<list id="q_2" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(2)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_2a"><label>a.</label><p>Alvin served [<SUB>NP</SUB> the sandwich] (to someone). b. Alvin served [<SUB>NP</SUB> Bill] (something).</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>The sluicing data discussed here are relevant on the assumption that they cannot be considered cases of sprouting, where the antecedent clause plausibly does not contain a syntactic position correlated with the fronted <italic>wh-</italic>phrase in the elliptical clause, as illustrated with the adjunction structure in (i) from Ross (1969:252).</p>
<p>(i) He is writing something, but you can&#x2019;t imagine where/why/how (fast).</p>
<p>That structures involving adjuncts might differ from structures with implicit arguments in relevant respects is indicated by the data in (2)&#x2013;(3) in the main text. I thank Jeffrey Lidz and Alexander Williams for drawing my attention to this issue.</p>
<p>47</p>
<list id="q_3" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(3)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">

<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Bill served the sandwich, but no one knows [<SUB>S</SUB> [<SUB>PP</SUB> to whom]].</p>
<p>c.	*Bill served the sandwich, but no one knows [<SUB>S</SUB> [<SUB>NP</SUB> whom]].</p>
<p>The data in (3) suggest that some type of structural parallelism between the antecedent and the sluiced clause is required for sluicing to be acceptable even with unrealised arguments, as, semantically, all variants in (3) involve structures with three arguments. This supports the treatment of clauses with indefinite missing objects as transitive, unless a theory of sluicing which can incorporate the data in (3) and the ability of intransitive clauses to license sluicing in a transitive structure can be developed. Accordingly, in this chapter I offer an analysis of structures with indefinite missing objects which takes the objects to be represented in the syntax.</p>
<p><bold>2.2 Indefinite missing objects as <italic>n</italic></bold></p>
<p>To provide a maximally uniform syntax for transitive verbs and for different types of structures with missing objects, I suggest that internal arguments are represented both semantically and syntactically regardless whether they are overt or null. In the syntax, indefinite missing objects have the most minimal representa-48</p>
<p>tion possible, that is they are represented by the nominalising head <italic>n</italic>. Since the object does not impose numerosity restrictions on its interpretation and can be interpreted similarly to mass nouns such as <italic>stuff</italic>, as illustrated in (4) from Fillmore (1986:106), the proposed representation which does not include the Num(ber) head seems sufficient to account for its interpretation.<sup>3</sup> This minimal representation is therefore preferable to less economical representations involving additional applications of Merge.</p>
<list id="q_4" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(4)</label><p>I spent three days cooking &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>The sentence in (4) is thus represented as shown in (5).</p>
<list id="q_5" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(5)</label><p>I spent three days [<SUB>VP</SUB> V-cooking [<italic>n-</italic>&#x00F8;]].</p>
<p>Admittedly, the problem of the number feature of the object is a complex one.<sup>4</sup> As discussed in section 1.1.1 of chapter 1, indefinite missing objects share scopal properties with both mass nouns and bare plurals. Bare singulars do not seem to be a plausible option, as they are unavailable in English and they impose</p>
<p>restrictions on the numerosity of the referent of the noun phrase in Polish (see</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>I come back to this issue in more detail in section 2.2.2.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>See Williams (2012) for a treatment of null complement anaphora as a number-neutral argument and Mart&#x00ED; (2015), who analyses indefinite null objects as incorporated null bare number-unmarked nouns. In contrast, Mittwoch (2005) suggests that objects of this type can be represented as null bare plurals and, similarly, Erteschik-Shir (2007) suggests that the object is plural.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>(6b)), differing from missing objects.</p>
<p>There are at least three arguments in favour of treating indefinite missing objects as unspecified for number rather than as plural. The first one, already mentioned, is that assimilating missing objects with mass nouns allows for a more minimal structural representation of the objects, whereas the plural specification of the object would require the Merge of the Num head. The former option is compatible also with the observation that, cross-linguistically, mass nouns are a more basic option, as they seem to be available in all languages (Chierchia 1994).</p>
<p>The second argument relates to the interpretive properties of these structures. In particular, as illustrated in (6) from Grochowski (1972:166) for Polish, the number feature of the object can constrain interpretation of the sentence either to only habitual reading (see (6a)) or only episodic reading (see (6b)). The missing object is compatible with both readings, as demonstrated in (7), suggesting that no condition on the numerosity of the referent of the object is imposed by the structure.</p>
<list id="q_6" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(6)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_6a"><label>a.</label><p>Jan pali papierosy. Jan smokes cigarettes &#x2018;Jan smokes cigarettes&#x2019;</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Jan pali papierosa. Jan smokes cigarette &#x2018;Jan is smoking a cigarette.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>50</p>
<list id="q_7" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(7)</label><p>Jan pali &#x00F8;. Jan smokes</p>
<p>&#x2018;Jan smokes cigarettes./Jan is smoking a cigarette.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>Additionally, introducing the plural-number feature in the representation would raise questions about what licenses the lack of its morphophonological realisation, an issue to which I turn in the following section. I thus conclude that no number projection or feature is present in the structure of indefinite missing ob-jects.</p>
<p><italic>2.2.1 Silence of </italic>n</p>
<p>The discussion of the silence of the object represented as <italic>n </italic>is related to the hypotheses about the feature content <italic>ofn </italic>and the way in which it is realised by the morphophonological component in different languages. The morphological composition of lexical nouns in English and Hungarian suggests that in these languages the <italic>n </italic>head in general need not be overt:</p>
<list id="q_8" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(8)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_8a"><label>a.</label><p>[<sub>NumP</sub> NumS<SUB>G</SUB>-&#x00F8; [<sub><italic>n</italic>P</sub> <italic>n-&#x00F8; </italic><sc>[</sc>&#x221A;<sc>horse]]] </sc>-&#x25BA; horse	[English]</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>[NumP NumSG-&#x00F8; [ <italic>n</italic><sc>p </sc><italic>n-&#x00F8; </italic><sc>[</sc>&#x221A;<sc>l&#x00D3;]]] </sc><bold>-&#x25BA; </bold>l&#x00F3;	[Hungarian]</p>
<p>The lack of morphophonological realisation of an object represented as <italic>n </italic>in these languages thus follows from the lexical specification <italic>of n, </italic>which need not be</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>associated with phonemic features. The same <italic>n </italic>head which composes the nouns in (8) can be merged as an object on its own, that is without first being merged with a lexical root. When this happens, a structure with a missing object results. An important question pertains to the case feature of the missing object, especially that in Hungarian accusative case is realised with an overt marker (e.g. <italic>l&#x00F3;-t </italic>&#x2018;horse-Ace&#x2019;), which does not surface in contexts with missing objects. Some empirical observations suggest that case is not included in the representation of missing objects of the type considered here.<sup>5</sup> Firstly, structures with missing objects cannot participate in the passive formation:</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>Dvo&#x0159;&#x00E1;k (2015:87) provides the example in (i), modelled on Rizzi&#x2019;s (1986) examples, to support an analysis on which generic missing objects in Czech do not have case:</p>
<p>(i)	a. Natyhlepr&#x00E1;&#x0161;kypozor, d&#x011B;laj&#x00ED; &#x010D;lov&#x011B;ka	otup&#x011B;l&#x00FD;m/</p>
<p>of these pills beware make human-SG.M.ACC dull-SG.M.iNSTR &#x0025;otup&#x011B;l&#x00E9;ho.</p>
<p>dull-SG.M.ACC</p>
<p>&#x2018;Beware of these pills, they make one dull.&#x2019; b. Natyhlepr&#x00E1;&#x0161;kypozor, d&#x011B;laj&#x00ED; &#x00F8; otup&#x011B;l&#x00FD;m/	*otup&#x011B;l&#x00E9;ho.</p>
<p>of these pills beware make dull-SG.M.iNSTR dull-SG.M.ACC</p>
<p>&#x2018;Beware of these pills, they make one dull.&#x2019;	[Czech]</p>
<p>In contrast to the structure with the noun <italic>&#x010D;lov&#x011B;ka </italic>&#x2018;human-SG.M.ACc&#x2019;, where most speakers accept agreement in case between the predicative adjective and the noun, when the subject of this predication is null, only instrumental case is available. Unfortunately, as is also clear in Rizzi&#x2019;s discussion of similar contexts, this structure does not in fact contain a null object, but rather a null subject of the small clause (verbs such as <italic>make </italic>take the small clause as their sole object, rather than taking both a nominal object and a small clause (the meaning of the sentences is not that pills make one and one becomes dull; the only element related to pills by the verb <italic>make </italic>is the predication that one is dull)). This example thus provides information about the case feature of the subject of the small clause and can be taken to be relevant to studies of null objects only on the assumption that the position of the subject of small clauses and the position of the null object must be occupied by the same element. Equivalent sentences in Polish are compatible only with instrumental case on the adjective, regardless whether the subject of the small clause is null or overt.</p>

<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>*&#x00F8; is drunk by Wendy.</p>
<p>If becoming the subject in a passive clause is conditioned by the availability of a noun phrase to have its case feature valued as nominative (at least in the languages which are the focus here, cf., e.g., <italic>Did she give you a book?</italic>/<italic>Were you given a book? </italic>and <italic>Did she give a book to you?</italic>/<italic>*Were/was to you given a book?</italic>), data such as (9) are explained if the missing object lacks the case feature.</p>
<p>The pattern in (10), quoted here from Alexiadou, Sch&#x00E4;fer &#x0026; Spathas (2013:5&#x2013; 9), can also be analysed as a consequence of the lack of case in the projection of the missing object.</p>

<p><italic>Out</italic>-prefixation and resultative structures are unacceptable with two overt objects, but when the selected object is null, the non-selected one becomes acceptable. On the assumption that structural accusative case can be assigned only to one noun phrase in a clause and that the missing object lacks the case feature, the non-selected object can have its case feature valued instead. This is true also when such structures are passivised, as shown in (11) from a random internet</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>search.</p>
<list id="q_11" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(11)</label><p>

<p>dogs in the same 10 minutes [...] b. [...] the bar was drunk dry on opening night [...]</p>
<p>In both (10) and (11) the semantics includes the selected object (e.g. John ate something edible in (10a)), a fact which is accounted for on the analysis which postulates the presence of this object in the structure, as illustrated in (12).<sup>6</sup></p>
<list id="q_12" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Mary [<SUB>VP</SUB> drank <italic>n-&#x00F8; </italic><sc>[small clause </sc>the teapot dry]].</p>
<p>The hypothesis that the object lacks case also explains why the object can be null in Hungarian without additional assumptions. In particular, even though in English the morphological shape of the noun does not change with varying case environments (e.g. <italic>The horse is wild vs. I&#x2019;ve seen the horse), </italic>as an agglutinative language, Hungarian marks varying case features with transparent agglutinative suffixes attached to the noun (e.g. <italic>l&#x00F3;-t </italic>&#x2018;horse-Ace&#x2019; vs. <italic>l&#x00F3;-nak </italic>&#x2018;horse-DAx&#x2019;). If the missing object had its case feature valued as accusative, an additional mech-</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>The exact syntactic structure of sentences of this type remains to be analysed, among others, as far as the position of the non-subcategorised object and the position at which the element <italic>out </italic>originates in the <italic>out-</italic>prefixation construction are concerned.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>anisms resulting in the lack of realisation of the accusative morpheme <italic>-t </italic>would need to be introduced.<sup>7</sup> However, this is not necessary if the object lacks case.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the discussion in this work, I assume that the case feature is introduced on a K(ase) head (see Lamontagne &#x0026; Travis 1987).<sup>8</sup> The lack of the case feature in the structure of the object can now be modelled as the absence of the K head in the representation of this argument, which also follows as a consequence of the hypothesis that the missing argument has a minimal structural representation (i.e. it is represented only as <italic>n</italic>).</p>
<p>The lack of K and Num also derives the silence of an object represented as <italic>n </italic>in Polish. Polish differs from English and Hungarian in that its gender system is grammatical. Nominal roots and stems are followed by portmanteaux suffixes encoding gender, number, and case. I illustrate this in Table 1 and in the examples in (13).</p>
<p>	SG.NOM	SG.ACC	PL.NOM	PL.ACC</p>

<p>Table 2.1: Examples of nominal gender/number/Case suffixes in Polish</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>This could be stated as a last-resort deletion operation removing the suffix in the absence of an appropriate host which it could attach to, or as a morphological realisation rule dictating zero-realisation of case in this environment.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Nothing in the analysis to be offered here hinges on this and the case feature might equally well be taken here to be introduced as a feature on one of the other nominal heads.</p>

<p>Apart from nominative singular nouns, for example, in the masculine personal class (M1), nominal suffixes are overt in Polish. From the theoretical point of view, the suffixes could be taken to be morphological realisations of a complex <italic>n</italic>-Num-K head, resulting from head movement within the noun phrase. This approach, developed for Polish in Willim (2012) and building on the analysis of French in Lowenstamm (2008), takes the <italic>n </italic>head to contain gender, a feature implicated in noun classification in systems with grammatical gender. The suggestion that the gender/number/case suffixes realise the <italic>n</italic>-Num-K complex (or only <italic>n, </italic>if all three features are encoded on <italic>n) </italic>follows naturally from the association <italic>ofn </italic>with gender (see Willim 2012 for further discussion).<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>As the forms in the nominal paradigm are defined for gender/number/case</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>In some instances, gender can be encoded on <italic>n </italic>also in English, if nouns such as <italic>lioness </italic>can be analysed as composed with the root &#x221A;<sc>lion </sc>and <italic>n </italic><sub>[G</sub>:<SUB>F]</SUB>, realised as <italic>-ess </italic>in morphology and, similarly, compounds such as <italic>she-goat </italic>can be analysed as involving <italic>n</italic><sub>[G</sub>:<SUB>F]</SUB> realised as <italic>she. </italic>In the discussion of pronouns in section 3.2 of chapter 3, I take the pronoun <italic>she </italic>to realise <italic>n</italic><sub>[G</sub>:<SUB>F] </SUB>embedded in a DP structure.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>combinations, a question arises what happens when <italic>n </italic>reaches the morphophono-logical system caseless and numberless. If the present hypothesis about the representation of missing objects is correct, the morphophonological system of Polish has to contain a rule interpreting <italic>n </italic>as null in this context (rather than treating the structure as illegitimate). I take this to be the case here, as it makes it possible to provide a uniform treatment of indefinite missing objects in languages with different morphological systems, such as English ((mostly) analytic), Hungarian (agglutinative), and Polish (inflectional).<sup>10</sup></p>

<label>2.2.2</label>
<title>Meaning of n</title>
<p>A detailed investigation of the semantics of nominal categorising heads is beyond the scope of this work. However, the present proposal concerning the representation of missing objects requires that the denotation of <italic>n </italic>be such that it can combine with the denotation of a lexical root and that it can be interpretable in the absence of the root. I therefore suggest that the most basic denotation <italic>ofn </italic>is as shown in (14), where the self-identity condition is trivially satisfied.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup>10</sup>As discussed in &#x00C9;. Kiss (2002:29), non-referential bare noun arguments in Hungarian obligatorily move out of VP to a pre-verbal A-bar position in focusless sentences. In the relevant contexts, missing objects represented as <italic>n </italic>could also undergo this type of movement in Hungarian.</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>Possible alternatives to the self-identity condition require further detailed consideration. The denotation proposed here has been inspired by the analysis of the semantics of null complement anaphora in Williams (2012) (e.g. <italic>Ron won &#x00F8;: Won(Ron,[iy(y </italic>= y)])), where the complement is interpreted as definite via the application of <italic><bold>v</bold>.</italic></p>
<p>57</p>
<list id="q_14" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(14)</label><p><italic>n</italic><SUP>A</SUP> = Ay.T=y = y</p>
<p>Lexical roots can plausibly be taken to have denotations of the type as in (15), which on the current proposal means that the <italic>n </italic>head combines with the root by predicate modification (Heim &#x0026; Kratzer 1998), resulting in <italic>n</italic>Ps with denotations such as Ay.T <sc>ee </sc>y = y &#x0026; ROOT(y), as shown in (16).</p>
<list id="q_15" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(15)</label><p>&#x221A;ooT|<SUP>A</SUP> = Ay.TEERooT(y)</p>

<p>&#x221A;<sc>root </sc>Ay.TEEy=y Ay.TEEROOT(y)</p>
<p>Furthermore, as discussed in the previous section, the <italic>n </italic>head can in some cases contain the gender feature, which can also contribute to interpretation (e.g. in nouns such as <italic>lioness </italic>in English (see footnote 9) and nouns denoting humans and certain animals in Polish). In such a case, the basic denotation of the <italic>n </italic>head is enriched by the denotation of the gender feature:</p>
<list id="q_17" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(17)</label><p><italic>n </italic><sub>[G:F]</sub>1<SUP>A</SUP> = Ay.TEEy=y&#x0026;FEMAL<SUB>E</SUB>(y)</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>A null object represented as <italic>n </italic>thus has the denotation Ay.T <sc>ee </sc>y = y, or, if it includes an interpretable gender feature, the denotation of this feature is also included in the denotation of the object. Being of type (e,t), such an object is of course not of the right type to saturate the internal argument position of the verb. The choice of a solution depends on one&#x2019;s broader approach to the semantics of nominal expressions and should ideally parallel the mechanism which is used to interpret mass nouns and bare plurals, as these three types of expressions behave in parallel in terms of scope, that is they can only take narrow scope, as shown in section 1.1.1 of chapter 1. Committing the analysis to one particular semantic approach seems unnecessary for the present purpose, since whatever possible analysis is adopted for the interpretation of mass nouns should be applicable to missing objects on the current proposal.</p>
<p>For illustration, within the system of interpretation of indefinites proposed in Chung &#x0026; Ladusaw (2004), the missing argument can combine with the verb by Restrict, that is a mode of composition which does not saturate the predicate, but which makes it possible for objects of type (e,t) to restrict the predicate with the property introduced by the object without saturating it.<sup>12</sup> I illustrate this for</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>The empirical domainofChung and Ladusaw&#x2019;s (2004) study focuses on indefinites in Maori and incorporation in Chamorro, but they suggest that Restrict could also be used for interpretation of bare plurals in English (p. 70-71).</p>
<p>That indefinite missing objects can be interpreted by tools developed in Chung &#x0026; Ladusaw (2004) has been suggested independently in Mart&#x00ED; (2015), who analyses this construction as involving incorporation of a null noun to the verb.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>the sentence <italic>Anna is reading </italic>in (18)&#x2013;(20), modelled on Chung and Ladusaw&#x2019;s representations.</p>
<p>Even though Restrict does not result in the saturation of the predicate, it has the effect of demoting the affected argument from the top of the lambda prefix to a position right above the event argument. This is needed to ensure that the next higher argument in the syntax can saturate the external argument, in accordance with the view that the order in which arguments provided by syntax are composed with the predicate is determined by the lambda prefix.</p>

<p>= 3e3y[read&#x2019;(y)(a)(e)A[y = y](y)]</p>
<p>The existential closure of the internal argument variable is enforced by the principle in (21), where the event level is understood as the stage in the derivation where the event argument is reached (Chung &#x0026; Ladusaw 2004:11):</p>
<list id="q_21" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(21)</label><p>Predicates must have their participant arguments (semantically) sat urated at the event level.</p>
<p>Since the internal argument is existentially closed at the event level, employing this system accounts for the obligatory narrow scope of the argument with respect to all elements which scope above this level, such as operators binding the event variable, negation, and quantified nominals.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>I suggest that the interpretation of an existentially-closed object is further guided by pragmatic considerations, so that the object in the corpus example in</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Amissing object represented as<italic>n</italic>, like the impersonal subject in the <sc><bold>se </bold></sc>construction (see Chierchia 1995), is an indefinite that is existentially closed in an episodic context, but can be bound by a generic operator or by adverbs of quantification in a generic context, acquiring a quasi-universal interpretation after existential disclosure (see section 4.2.4 of chapter 4 for some relevant examples).</p>
<p><sup>14</sup>In fact, obligatory narrow scope is treated by Chung &#x0026; Ladusaw (2004) as a diagnostic for the interpretation of an indefinite via Restrict.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>That contexts such as (22c) are best analysed as involving pragmatic inference rather than definite argument omission is suggested by the fact that verbs which drop definite objects do not require such strong contextual support (e.g. <italic>Anna has just called (us)</italic>; see also Mart&#x00ED; 2015; Williams 2015).</p>

<label>2.2.3</label>
<title>Indefinite missing objects and incorporation</title>
<p>Some discussions suggest that structures with indefinite missing objects should be analysed as incorporation structures (see, e.g., Croft 2012; P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux et al. 2013; Mart&#x00ED; 2015). The interpretive similarities between incorporated nominals and missing objects include their indefiniteness and number neutrality, as well as their obligatory narrow scope. The example in (23) from Mart&#x00ED; (2015:456), where the incorporated noun <italic>snoek </italic>&#x2018;pike&#x2019; can only take narrow scope, demonstrates this.</p>
<list id="q_23" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(23)</label><p>Hja sille net te snoek-fangen they will not to pike-catch &#x2018;They are not going to catch any pikes.&#x2019;	[Frisian]</p>
<p>On the current proposal these structures are similar in that they can both be treated as interpreted via Restrict and, if (at least some) incorporated nominals can be taken to lack number specification and hence be represented as <italic>n</italic>Ps, they share the syntactic representation, including the lack of the number projection. However, as the scopal property is shared also with bare plurals and mass nouns in English and can be accounted for by principles which are not directly related to incorporation (see (21)), it seems that assuming that an additional process of incorporation is at play in structures with missing objects is superfluous. What</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>is more, if incorporation were involved in the formation of structures with indefinite missing objects in English (see esp. Mart&#x00ED; 2015 for an analysis of this type), accounting for the acquisition of these structures in a language where overt nouns do not incorporate would posit a serious challenge, as there seems to be no evidence which could lead the child to postulate this process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some empirical evidence suggesting that the two types of structures should not be equated and that indefinite missing objects are not simply incorporated null nouns is provided by Hungarian. In particular, Hungarian has (a type of) incorporation, in which a number-unmarked accusative bare noun precedes the verb, as illustrated in (24) from Kiefer (1994:444).<sup>16</sup></p>
<list id="q_24" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(24)</label><p>Pisti levelet &#x00ED;r.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup>The translation provided follows that in Kiefer (1994:444), even though in text he suggests that a more accurate translation of the example is &#x2018;be engaged in letter writing&#x2019;. The text in this structure is number-neutral semantically.</p>
<p>As noted in Bende-Farkas (2001), this is not the full incorporation of the West-Greenlandic type and the incorporated nominal can be separated from the verb, for example, when in the contrastive topic or quantifier position (see (i) from Bende-Farkas 2001:69).</p>

<p>For more discussion, see Kiefer (1990, 1994); Bende-Farkas (2001); Farkas &#x0026; de Swart (2003).</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>If the argument that indefinite missing objects do not have the case feature is on the right track (see section 2.2.1), incorporated nominals differ from missing objects in being case-marked.</p>
<p>Secondly, indefinite missing objects are available in the presence of preverbs with at least some verbs in Hungarian (see (25); see section 5.3.2 of chapter 5 for some more discussion).</p>
<list id="q_25" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>&#x2018;Dad has finished cooking and then went to play football.&#x2019;[Hungarian]</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kiefer (1990, 1994) shows that incorporated nouns and pre-verbs are in complementary distribution (see (26) from Kiefer 1994:450) and takes it to imply that the bare noun and the preverb <italic>meg </italic>belong to the same class of elements.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p><sup>17</sup>Farkas &#x0026; de Swart (2003:93) suggest that bare nominals and preverbs are not mutually exclusive, but when they appear together, the preverb has to follow the verb (see (i)). Indefinite missing objects do not have this effect.</p>

<p>The difference in judgments provided by Kiefer (1994) and Farkas &#x0026; de Swart (2003) might be due to the use of different preverbs, but this requires further investigation.</p>

<p>Since anaphors in Polish are strictly subject/external-argument-bound, the next of Rizzi&#x2019;s tests, that is the ability of the missing object to bind an anaphor, is inapplicable to Polish. In Hungarian an anaphor can be bound by an overt generic object (see (32a)). A third-person anaphor is incompatible with a generic</p>
<p><sup>18</sup>As Hungarian makes definite (singular) object drop widely available, sentences such as (31) are acceptable on the reading where a definite object is dropped, but not on the generic/arbitrary reading.</p>

<p>67</p>
<p>missing object. The acceptable example in (32b), where the verb bears definite conjugation marking, enforces reference to a specific person. Indefinite conjugation marking on the verb results in an unacceptable sentence (see (32c)). When the anaphor is marked for second person, the generic reading seems available (see (32d)). This is an instance of a generic reading of the second-person pronoun.<sup>19 </sup>Within the present analysis, the examples in (32) show that an object represented as <italic>n </italic>cannot participate in anaphoric binding in Hungarian.</p>

<p><sup>20</sup>Substituting the adverb <italic>nago </italic>&#x2018;nude&#x2019; with a corresponding adjective results in degraded acceptability in structures with overt objects such as (33a) and is interpreted as an elliptical NP or substantivisation in structures such as (33b) (i.e. &#x2018;...examines (the) naked (ones)&#x2019;).

<p>&#x2018;As a serious doctor, I examine nude.&#x2019;	[Hungarian]</p>
<p>Within the present proposal, there is exactly one representational difference between the missing object in Polish, where control is available, and in English and Hungarian, where it is not. Namely, <italic>n </italic>contains gender in Polish. If establishing the relation of control can be taken to depend on a nominal being specified for at least one &#x03C6; feature, the data can be accommodated within the current system.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><sup>21</sup>The object-oriented reading is accessible in (i), but, according to my informants, this sentence seems to involve the generic reading of a null second-person pronoun.</p>
<p>(i) Egy komoly orvos meztelen vizsg&#x00E1;l &#x00F8;. a serious doctor naked examines &#x2018;A serious doctor examines you while he is nude/while you are nude.&#x2019; [Hungarian]</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>Interestingly, Italian, French, and Czech, in which arbitrary missing objects can participate in control (see Rizzi 1986; Authier 1989; Dvo&#x0159;&#x00E1;k 2015 respectively), are also systems with grammatical gender. See section 2.4 below for some more discussion of control-related variation.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>This does not seem implausible, for example, within the approach to binding developed in Kratzer (2009), where the &#x03C6;-feature sets of PRO and the missing object would need to unify (via mediation of verbal functional heads). As the &#x03C6;-feature set of the object <italic>n </italic>is null in English and Hungarian, unification cannot affect the content of the &#x03C6;-feature set of PRO, resulting in the failure of control. Considering the unavailability of anaphoric binding and modification by a small clause, control structures seem to be the only candidate for diagnosing the value of the gender feature of missing objects in Polish. As masculine is the unmarked option on nouns denoting humans, it is the first choice, as shown in (35a). The masculine value of the gender feature as well as the value of the number feature is reflected in the adjectival morphology of the intensifier <italic>samego </italic>&#x2018;alone-M.SG.AcC&#x2019;/ <italic>sam&#x0105; </italic>&#x2018;alone-F.SG.Acc&#x2019;, which modifies the anaphor bound by PRO.<sup>23</sup> The value of feminine gender is reflected in contexts where reference is to female individuals, as shown in (35b).</p>

<p><sup>23</sup> A similar observation is provided in Dvo&#x0159;&#x00E1;k (2015) for Czech.</p>
<p>These data can be used as a test for &#x03C6;-feature values of the missing object on the assumption that PRO includes only the features which are borne by the object, rather than contributing features/values of its own.</p>

<p>ofthemselves.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>Out of context, the number feature is singular. Plural number is possible when the missing object refers to a contextually salient group of people, in which case the structure involves definite object drop (see chapter 3 for an analysis):</p>

<p>samych]. alone-M.PL.Acc &#x2018;This flyer encourages us to take care of ourselves.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>Mass nouns also trigger singular agreement (e.g. <italic>ry&#x017C;jest gotowy </italic>&#x2018;rice is ready-M.SG&#x2019;), which can be taken to arise by default.</p>
<p>Wrapping up, the tests available in the respective languages show that the arbitrary object, taken here to be represented as <italic>n, </italic>can participate in control in Polish, but not in English and Hungarian. It is not a possible binder either in English or in Hungarian. Data involving small clauses are unclear, with the object-oriented reading either being grammatically unavailable or being overwritten by a much more prominent subject-oriented reading. Rather than attributing the facts</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>observed in English and Hungarian to the lack of the projection of the object in the syntactic component (see Rizzi 1986), I suggest that the data result from the lack of the specification of the object <italic>n </italic>for &#x03C6; features in these languages. The specification of <italic>n </italic>in Polish for gender makes it available for participation in control.</p>

<title>The manner and result components of verb meaning</title>
<p>An influential approach to the ontological categories of roots distinguishes between the manner and result components of verb meaning (see also section 5.2.2 of chapter 5). According to this approach, unspecified object drop is a characteristic feature of manner roots and it is blocked with result roots (see Rappa-port Hovav &#x0026; Levin 1998; Levin 1999; Rappaport Hovav &#x0026; Levin 2010; Beavers &#x0026; Koontz-Garboden 2012). However, the part of this approach related to object drop faces some serious challenges. For example, even though the verb <italic>write</italic>, which is a manner verb, makes object drop possible, verbs expressing the manner of writing do not, as illustrated in (37) from Rice (1988:203). Similar patterns are observed with verbs of manner of reading, eating, and drinking. This is unexpected on the analysis predicting that manner verbs should make object drop possible.</p>

<p>Furthermore, closer inspection reveals that the problem is actually reverse with the verbs <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink</italic>. In particular, these verbs cannot be considered as manner verbs. Unspecified object drop aside, some other diagnostics for detecting the manner and result components of verb meaning indicate that manner verbs require animate subjects, as shown in (38) and (39) from Beavers &#x0026; Koontz-Garboden (2012:344), and that result verbs are incompatible with the denial of result, as illustrated in (40) and (41) from Beavers &#x0026; Koontz-Garboden (2012:337) and discussed also in Beavers (2011).</p>

<p>As indicated in (42)&#x2013;(43), the verb <italic>eat </italic>passes both kinds of tests, similarly to the</p>

<p>Even though the manner component is clearly present in the manner-of-eating and manner-of-drinking verbs, the verbs <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink </italic>seem neutral with respect to manner. That manner is indeed underspecified with <italic>eat </italic>is indicated by examples such as (44), gathered in a random internet search and concerning providing nutrition through a feeding tube, a process which can be done through the nose or by inserting the tube directly into the stomach.</p>
<list id="q_44" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>The diagnostics for detecting the meaning components certainly need to be interpreted with caution. The reason why the verbs <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink </italic>pass the Agent-related manner test might not be that they lexically encode the manner component, but rather that, in line with the analysis in Jackendoff (1990), the Agent also provides the Path/Goal for movement of the thing eaten (Theme). The (slightly simplified) conceptual structure of <italic>drink </italic>and <italic>eat </italic>from Jackendoff (1990:53, 253) is shown in (45).<sup>24</sup></p>
<list id="q_45" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(45)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_45a"><label>a.</label><p>[<sub>Event</sub> CAUSE ([<sub>Thing</sub> ] [<sub>Event</sub> GO ([<sub>Thing</sub> LIQUID] [<sub>Path</sub> TO (<sub>Place</sub> IN ([<sub>Thing</sub> MOUTH OF ([<sub>Thing</sub> ])]))])])] b. [CAUSE ([<sub>Thing</sub> ] [GO ([<sub>Thing</sub> [TO [IN [MOUTH-OF[<italic>&#x03B1;</italic>]]]]])])]</p>
<p>The incompatibility of these verbs with instrument subjects, as shown in (42), receives an explanation, in that, for example, a spoon cannot provide a Path/Goal,</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>These representations might require modification, as indicated by (44), where the food does not pass through the mouth and by the fact that taking something into the mouth does not necessarily result in it being eaten. What is important for the present purpose is that <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink </italic>are treated as causative/result verbs. The Goal is conceptually the Agent, which implies that a change in the object necessarily triggers a change in the Agent.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>as at the end of the eating event, the thing eaten is not inside the spoon. This means that the intuition that <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink </italic>do not encode manner is not challenged by the data.<sup>25</sup> This is in line with Jackendoff&#x2019;s analysis, on which <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink </italic>are causative, change of location, result verbs. As result verbs, <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink </italic>are thus problematic for the analysis offered in Rappaport Hovav &#x0026; Levin (1998, 2010), because result verbs, whose event structure template consist of two subevents ([[x ACT] CAUSE [y BECOME &#x003C;RESULT-STATE&#x003E;]]), should not make object drop possible (see section 5.2.2 of chapter 5).</p>
<p>Summing up, the behaviour of verbs of manner of writing, among others, and the behaviour of the verbs <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink </italic>suggest that the division of verbs into ones which encode manner and ones which encode result is insufficient for capturing the patterns of object drop. If the claims about the correlations between the meaning components and object drop made in the literature were right, verbs of manner of writing should make object drop freely available, whereas the</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>As noted above, Levin (2013) categorises <italic>eat </italic>as a manner verb. However, she suggests that result verbs are most convincingly distinguished from manner verbs if the argument which undergoes the change must be interpreted as being different at the end of the event. As the thing eaten is necessarily different at the end of the eating event (as well as the agent of eating), I take this characterisation of result verbs to support the conclusion reached here.</p>
<p>In addition to the two-way distinction between manner and result roots, Beavers &#x0026; Koontz-Garboden (2012) argue for the existence of another ontological category, namely manner+result roots, encoding both components simultaneously, based mostly on the behaviour of manner-of-killing verbs (e.g. <italic>crucify, guillotine</italic>). Rappaport Hovav &#x0026; Levin (1998) also note (fn. 4) that verbs such as <italic>cut </italic>specify both manner and result, even though they assume complementarity between the two components. Verbs of manner of eating and drinking seem also to encode both manner and result. See Husband (2011) for some additional discussion of manner+result verbs.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>verbs <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink </italic>should block object drop, contrary to fact. The regularities which emerge from the data seem to indicate instead that rich specification of manner blocks unspecified object drop, or at least decreases its acceptability in cases where the more basic verb makes object drop possible (see section 1.2 of chapter 1 for a formulation of this observation in terms of a <italic>Manner specification generalisation</italic>). Rich manner specification has a role to play in object drop when the neutral verb is a manner verb (e.g. <italic>write </italic>vs. <italic>inscribe</italic>) and when it is a result verb (e.g. <italic>eat </italic>vs. <italic>munch</italic>). In addition, when there does not seem to be any more neutral equivalent of a verb, rich manner does not block object drop, at least for manner verbs (e.g. <italic>i ro n</italic>).</p>
<p>One other interesting distinction uncovered by the data presented above relates to verbs encoding only result. More specifically, if the verbs <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink </italic>are result verbs, there is also a distinction within the result class in that some result verbs make unspecified object drop generally available (<italic>eat/drink</italic>), whereas others make object drop available only in special licensing contexts (e.g. <italic>I&#x2019;ve never killed &#x00F8; before</italic>; see chapter 5). The difference between <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>drink </italic>on the one hand and <italic>kill </italic>on the other can be hypothesised to be due to the fact that in the former case, the Agent provides the Path/Goal for movement of the Theme/Patient</p>
<p>at the same time, triggering result construal.<sup>26</sup> As the result relates not only to the</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>A similar pattern holds of reflexives. For example, in sentences such as (i), Tom is not only the Agent, but he (his skin) also provides a Path/Goal.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>object argument in this case, but also to the subject (e.g. the eating event can be over either when the food is gone or when the Agent&#x2019;s stomach is full), the specification of the Agent is enough for the event to be conceptualised as potentially delimited.</p>
</sec1>

<label>2.4</label>
<title>Summary and extensions</title>
<p>The empirical observations which have been the focus of the second part of this chapter (section 2.3) concern the blocking of object drop by the addition of manner specification to a more neutral verb meaning and to the suggestion that result verbs do not make object drop possible unless the Agent provides the Path/Goal at the same time, triggering result construal. I have taken these effects to be rooted in the semantic and pragmatic components of human cognition. Developing a detailed account of why the relevant contexts do not license a null <italic>n </italic>object needs to be addressed in future research.</p>
<p>The main hypothesis put forward in this chapter is that indefinite missing objects can be represented in the syntactic component as the nominalising head <italic>n</italic>,</p>
<p>whose basic denotation is <italic>&#x03BB;</italic>y.<italic>&#x22A4;&#x2261; </italic>y = y. Such an object is interpreted in par-(i) Tom shaved.</p>
<p>Alexiadou et al. (2013) likewise note a link between verbs such as <italic>eat </italic>and reflexives, but their analysis relies on the correctness of Levin and Rappaport Hovav&#x2019;s approach.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>allel with bare mass nouns, possibly by the application of the operation Restrict (Chung &#x0026; Ladusaw 2004). Missing objects of this type do not bear the case feature, but the <italic>n </italic>head can bear the gender feature, which can have an effect on the distribution and interpretation of missing objects, as the examples in (35) above demonstrate. I have hypothesised that the presence of gender in the projection of a missing object is responsible for the object being syntactically active (e.g. for its ability to participate in control).</p>
</sec2>

<label>2.4.1</label>
<title>Extensions: arbitrary missing objects and control</title>
<p>It is worth noting that the issue of the availability of control in sentences with arbitrary missing objects is even more intriguing than the previous literature suggests (see, e.g, Rizzi 1986; Landau 2010).<sup>27</sup> For example, as noted above, Hungarian patterns with English in that it clearly makes arbitrary missing objects available (see (46)&#x2013;(47)), but such objects are unavailable as controllers, regardless whether they appear in generic or in episodic contexts (see (48) and (49) respectively).</p>

<p>missing objects in English and Hungarian could result from the lack of grammatical gender in these languages.

<p>Furthermore, even though Italian makes control available in generic contexts (see (60)), based on examples such as (61), Rizzi (1986:504) makes the general claim that Italian makes arbitrary object drop available only in generic contexts.</p>

<p>What seems to be the case is that arbitrary objects can in general be dropped in Italian. It is only their ability to appear in control structures which is restricted. The contrast between the generic context in (63a) and the episodic context in (63b) illustrates this.</p>

<p>A different type of constraint is observed in Mandarin, where the initial examples in (65)&#x2013;(67) suggest that arbitrary object drop is completely blocked, even with structures without control.<sup>29</sup></p>

<p><sup>29</sup>This is consistent with data from other types of indefinite object drop in Mandarin, where object drop is also unavailable in structures such as <italic>Lisi ate </italic>(see section 2.4.2 below for some more discussion).</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>However, as illustrated in (68), at least the verb <italic>xialing </italic>&#x2018;order&#x2019; makes arbitrary objects available in a context similar to (67).</p>

<p>All the patterns above contrast further with Polish, where control is easily available with arbitrary missing objects, even in episodic contexts (see (70b)).</p>

<p>Furthermore, even though, providing the example in (71), Dvo&#x0159;&#x00E1;k (2015:79) suggests that Czech makes arbitrary missing objects unavailable in episodic contexts, the judgments presented there seem to be an artefact of the specific interpretation of the object favoured by this particular example.

<p>The patterns presented above show that, when considered from the cross-linguistic perspective, the availability of control in structures with arbitrary missing objects is a complex issue, ranging from completely unacceptable (English, Hungarian, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean) to being influenced by factors such as genericity and the availability of a specific context (Italian) or by lexical variation (Mandarin), to being generally available (Polish, Czech). Determining which elements of the grammar are responsible for the observed patterns is an interesting research question which needs to be answered not only for the sake of research on missing objects, but also for the sake of the development of theoretical analyses of control. This is a research project which cannot be undertaken here, but the complexity of the data in its own right suggests that caution is advisable when interpreting the lack of availability of control as evidence against the syntactic projection of an argument. This contrasts with the success of diagnosing a syntactically projected missing object that is syntactically alive and can control into an infinitival complement.</p>

<title>Extensions: </italic>read &#x00F8; <italic>versus </italic>kan-shu <italic>&#x2018;read-book&#x2019;</title>
<p>Expressing unspecified objects as null is one of two cross-linguistically attested patterns.<sup>30</sup> The other pattern, observed in languages such as Mandarin, requires an overt (semi-)pleonastic object to express this meaning. To illustrate, even though <italic>shu </italic>&#x2018;book&#x2019; and <italic>fan </italic>&#x2018;rice&#x2019; have descriptive content when used in other structures, when an unspecified object is intended, they do not constrain the interpretation of the theme argument with their regular denotation. The object in (73) from Lee (2014:17) need not necessarily be interpreted as books. It can also be interpreted, for example, as magazines. Similarly, the object in (74) from Cheng &#x0026; Sybesma (1998:81) refers to any kind of food.<sup>31</sup></p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Special thanks to Nick Huang, Shota Momma, and Dongwoo Park for their translations and judgments of the Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean data presented in this section.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>It seems that there might be some inter-speaker variation with respect to the extent to which <italic>fan </italic>&#x2018;rice&#x2019; in (74) can be bleached of its conceptual content. According to my informant, the noun <italic>dongxi </italic>&#x2018;thing&#x2019; would be more appropriate when the general meaning of food is intended, as shown in (i). The same does not seem to be true of <italic>kan </italic>&#x2018;read&#x2019;, where <italic>dongxi </italic>&#x2018;thing&#x2019; seems less natural. Following Cheng &#x0026; Sybesma (1998), I omit tone marking in the Mandarin examples here.</p>
<p>(i) wo bu ai chi-dongxi. I not like eat-thing &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t like to eat.&#x2019;	[Mandarin]</p>
<p>Interestingly, structures of this type are not completely parallel to the English-type data at least in terms of the inferential processes guiding their interpretation. This is shown by the fact that, for example, the sentence in (ii) does not trigger the reading on which Hemingway drank alcohol, unlike its English equivalent. To express the meaning which is associated by convention with the missing object in English, reference to alcohol has to be made explicit, as in (iii).</p>

<p>When nothing appears in the object position, the object has to be construed as anaphoric (Cheng &#x0026; Sybesma 1998:83):</p>
<list id="q_75" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(75)</label><p>Zhang San chi-le</p>
<p>Zhang San ate-PERF</p>
<p>&#x2018;Zhang San ate it.&#x2019;	[Mandarin]</p>
<p>Based on data of this type, Cheng &#x0026; Sybesma (1998:89) suggest the condition in (76) below, where <italic>pro </italic>stands for a definite argument.</p>
<list id="q_76" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(76)</label><p>If an object position allows for <italic>pro</italic>, then that position cannot be occu-</p>

<p>Hemingway yesterday drink-PERF thing &#x2018;Hemingway drank something (yesterday).&#x2019;	[Mandarin]</p>
<p>(iii) Haimingwei(zuotian) he-le	jiu.</p>
<p>Hemingway yesterday drink-PERF alcohol</p>
<p>&#x2018;Hemingway drank (alcohol) yesterday.&#x2019;	[Mandarin]</p>
<p>As noted in Cheng &#x0026; Sybesma (1998), also translational equivalents of intransitive verbs such <italic>asyawn </italic>and <italic>walk </italic>in Mandarin are composed of a verb and an object <italic>(da-haqian </italic>&#x2018;hit/do-yawn&#x2019; (&#x2018;yawn&#x2019;),<italic>zou-lu </italic>&#x2018;walk-road&#x2019; (&#x2018;walk&#x2019;)).</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>pied by non-referential empty objects. Such non-referential objects are expressed by an overt dummy nominal.</p>
<p>This condition relates the appearance of the overt (semi-)pleonastic nominal in contexts where an unspecified object is intended in languages such as Mandarin to the presence of definite object drop. However, data from Polish and Hungarian discussed throughout this work show that this generalisation does not hold, as these languages make available both definite and unspecified object drop with the same verb.<sup>32</sup></p>
<p>Moreover, the lack of parallelism between languages such as English and Mandarin does not affect all (notional) arguments. As revealed by (77)&#x2013;(78), taken from Lu, Zhang &#x0026; Bisang (2015:748&#x2013;749), the constituent <italic>100-yuan </italic>&#x2018;100 dollars&#x2019; can be omitted with the verb <italic>qiang </italic>&#x2018;rob&#x2019;, but not with the verb <italic>tou </italic>&#x2018;steal&#x2019;. These data pattern with English.</p>
<list id="q_77" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p><sup>32</sup>Lee (2014) notes that also Malayalam seems to contradict this generalisation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Lee (2014) proposes an analysis on which the object in all cases is represented syntactically as a nominal element and attributes the difference between languages of the English and the Mandarin type to Spell-Out rules, according to which the object is zero-realised in English, but its pronunciation in Mandarin is conditioned by the verb. Even though more empirical research seems necessary before theoretical approaches can be developed, this treatment of the data is consistent with the proposal put forward here, where a bare <italic>n </italic>would be realised as <italic>shu </italic>&#x2018;book&#x2019; when in the complement of <italic>kan </italic>&#x2018;read&#x2019;.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even though according to Cheng &#x0026; Sybesma (1998) and Lee (2014) Cantonese, Korean, Thai, and Mundang, among others, pattern with Mandarin in blocking unspecified object drop, the situation does not seem to be as clear-cut, at least in Korean. According to my informant, there is a clear difference in judgment of the verbs <italic>ssu </italic>&#x2018;write&#x2019; and <italic>mek </italic>&#x2018;eat&#x2019; in (79).</p>

<p>The availability of object drop with <italic>mek </italic>&#x2018;eat&#x2019; is further influenced by context:</p>

<p>&#x2018;I ate (something).&#x2019;	[Korean]</p>
<p>In addition, the verb <italic>chengso </italic>&#x2018;clean&#x2019;, which is a borrowing from Mandarin, behaves differently from the native Korean verb <italic>chiwu </italic>&#x2018;clean&#x2019;:</p>

<p>Japanese seems to behave similarly to Korean. According to my informant, the acceptability of sentences with unspecified object drop depends on the choice of the verb. In (82), the missing object of the verb <italic>tabetaku </italic>&#x2018;eat&#x2019; is unspecified and the sentence is perfectly acceptable. On the other hand, unspecified object drop is only marginally acceptable with the <italic>verbyomu </italic>&#x2018;read&#x2019; and it is completely unavailable with the <italic>verb yaku </italic>&#x2018;bake&#x2019;, as demonstrated in (83) and (84). Substituting the <italic>verbsyomu </italic>&#x2018;read&#x2019; an<italic>dyaku </italic>&#x2018;bake&#x2019; in (83)-(84) with <italic>tabetaku </italic>&#x2018;eat&#x2019; makes the sentences acceptable. These sentences also become acceptable when</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>the context establishes that the domain of possible referents of the objects is restricted, for example, to books or cakes, even if they remain unspecified.</p>

<p>The data presented here clearly provide some evidence that the suggested complementarity between definite and unspecified object drop (see (76)) is not a general property of natural language grammar. The core factors regulating the (un)availability of unspecified object drop in the relevant languages and its relation to definite object drop, if any, need to be reconsidered. For this to be possible, more fine-grained distinctions need to be taken into account in empirical research to determine the exact conditions under which unspecified objects can remain unpronounced in languages such as Mandarin, Korean, and Japanese. In</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>the light of the discussion in this work, one factor to consider in the empirical research is the influence of the specificity of verbal meaning, including the richness of the manner component, on the availability of unspecified object drop. This is especially important in the light of the fact that unspecified object drop is not unconstrained in English either, as expressed in the manner-related generalisation in section 1.2 of chapter 1, repeated here in (85).</p>
<list id="q_85" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(85)</label><p><italic>Manner specification generalisation	</italic>[parametrisable]</p>
<p>If a verb makes object drop available, its near synonym with a more specific manner component tends to block it.</p>
<p>Detailed research providing a deeper understanding of the empirical situation in the relevant languages is thus necessary if theories of object drop are to be complete.</p>
<p>In the present chapter, I have suggested that indefinite object drop can be accounted for by taking the object to be represented syntactically as the nominal-ising head <italic>n</italic>, interpreted, for example, via the application of Restrict. Together with the analysis of definite object drop which I develop in the following chapter, this account forms a coherent approach to the derivation of object drop in natural language grammar.</p>

<title>Definite missing objects</title>

</book-part-meta>
<body>
<p>In the spirit of the account offered in the preceding chapter, I suggest here that definite missing objects are present in the syntactic component and that their projection minimally consists of the nominal categorising head <italic>n</italic>. Whether <italic>n </italic>can function as a definite object on its own depends on the availability of the iota operation (<italic>&#x03B9;</italic>, that is the operation of type shifting a predicate to an individual) in a given language or in a given syntactic context. In addition to the availability of <italic>&#x03B9;</italic>, the distribution of definite missing objects is guided by, among others, the way in which heads composing pronouns in a language are interpreted at the syntax-morphology (SM) interface. The system developed here makes it possible to capture the observation that definite object drop is restricted lexically in English by suggesting that only some verbs make it possible for their complement to be</p>
<p>shifted with <italic>&#x03B9;</italic>. As a language which makes extensive use of bare noun arguments, Polish is not restricted in the same way. Hungarian does not make the application of <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>available at all, which is why its nominal arguments need to include further nominal heads to be interpreted as definite.</p>
<p>Section 3.1 presents the main theoretical claims made here. In section 3.2, I offer an analysis of the representations of personal pronouns in English, Polish, and Hungarian. These representations form a basis for developing some details of the analysis of definite missing objects, especially in Hungarian. I take pronouns in all languages discussed here to be KPs, but argue that their internal structure differs to some extent. English pronouns are represented as [<SUB>KP</SUB> K [<SUB>DP</SUB> D<sub>[Pers]</sub> [<sub>NumP</sub> Num [<italic>n</italic>]]]], Polish pronouns are represented as [<SUB>KP</SUB> K [<sub>PersP</sub> Pers [<sub>NumP</sub> Num [<italic>n</italic>]]]], and Hungarian pronouns are [<SUB>KP</SUB> K [<SUB>DP</SUB> D [<sub>PersP</sub> Pers [<sub>NumP</sub> Num [<italic>n</italic>]]]]] structures. Developing this analysis, I discuss how it can account for the intriguing morphological forms of Hungarian personal pronouns.</p>
<p>The analysis of definite missing objects is given in section 3.3. In section 3.3.1, I analyse definite missing objects in English, proposing that they are represented as <italic>n </italic>and interpreted with <italic>&#x03B9;</italic>, whose application is restricted to objects of particular verbs. I offer a parallel analysis of Polish in section 3.3.2, the difference being that the application of <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>is not restricted lexically in this language, as evidenced by its wide use of bare nominal arguments interpreted as definites.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>The availability of definite missing objects in Polish is constrained by the competition from overt pronominals. Definite missing objects in Hungarian are the focus of section 3.3.3, where I concentrate on an investigation of the source of the unacceptability of dropping (third-person) plural definite objects. Discussing the relevance of the verbal conjugational system of Hungarian to object drop, I argue against the established approach based on the notion of (semantic) recoverabil-ity of the number feature and I suggest instead that the relevant blocking factor is morphological: there is no available host in the structure with object drop to which the nominal plural-number affix could attach. First/second-person plural objects can be dropped in Hungarian. I suggest that this follows from the structural representation of first/second-person pronominal projections, which differs from the representation of third-person pronouns in that the Num head moves to Pers.</p>
<p>In section 3.3.4, I briefly discuss a different approach on which all definite missing objects are represented as DPs. I conclude that this alternative is theoretically unattractive.</p>

<label>3.1</label>
<title>Definite missing objects as partial pronominal structures</title>
<p>Viewed from the perspective of the comparison between definite missing objects and overt pronouns, the analysis proposed here breaks with the tradition taking null and overt pronouns to have the same structure that goes back as far as at least Perlmutter (1971). Instead, I take missing objects to lack case (the K head), similarly to indefinite missing objects analysed in the preceding chapter. On the decompositional approach to the structure of (pro)nominal phrases assumed here, the distribution of null and overt pronominals is regulated by the morphological properties of the exponents of the heads composing them and by the Spell-Out rules of the relevant languages.</p>
<p>The structural representation of definite missing objects offered here groups together English and Polish, to the exclusion of Hungarian. This is reflected in the way in which the structures are interpreted at the conceptual-intentional (C-I) interface. Whereas definite missing objects in English and Polish manifest some interpretive differences compared with overt pronouns in these languages and are taken here to be interpreted via the application of <italic>&#x03B9;</italic>, definite missing objects in Hungarian are interpreted in parallel with overt pronouns and are analysed here in the same way. The <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>operation employed in English and Polish is not associated with any syntactic head, but missing objects in Hungarian are DP structures. I</p>

<p>For the sake of concreteness, in section 3.2 I present some details concerning the syntactic structure of personal pronouns in English, Polish, and Hungarian which I assume in the present discussion.<sup>1</sup> I follow this with a discussion of the present proposal concerning definite missing objects in English, Polish, and</p>
<p>Hungarian in section 3.3.</p>

<p>I treat third person as a feature present in the representations rather than as the absence of person, even though nothing here hinges on this (see Lyons 1999; Harley &#x0026; Ritter 2002; Nevins 2007 for discussions).</p>

<title>The structure of pronouns in English, Polish, and Hungarian</title>
<p>Table 3.2 presents the basic forms of pronouns in English, Polish, and Hungar-ian.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Table 3.2: Accusative pronominal forms in English, Polish, and Hungarian</p>
<p>In this context, the theoretical utility of <italic>n</italic>, which I take here to compose lexical noun phrases and constitute the minimal representation of missing arguments, can be further extended to pronominal structures. More specifically, I take the</p>
<p>nominalising head <italic>n </italic>to be the lowest head in the projection of pronouns.<sup>3</sup> The <italic>n</italic></p>
<p><sup>2</sup>Table 3.2 presents the weak formsof Polish pronouns. The paradigm includes also the strong forms <italic>ciebie </italic>&#x2018;you<SUB>SG</SUB>&#x2019; and <italic>jego </italic>&#x2018;him&#x2019; and variants starting with <italic>n-</italic>, which are used following a preposition (e.g. <italic>na ni&#x0105;/niego/nie </italic>&#x2018;on her/him/it&#x2019;). Establishing a proper analysis of these forms does not have a bearing on the discussion here. It seems that a possible difference between the strong forms and the forms in Table 3.2 could be in the presence of the root in the complement of <italic>n</italic>.</p>
<p>In Hungarian the accusative suffix <italic>-et </italic>is optional with the first/second-person singular forms (Kenesei, Vago &#x0026; Fenyvesi 1998). There are alternative forms in the first and second person plural: <italic>benn&#x00FC;nket </italic>&#x2018;us&#x2019; and <italic>benneteket </italic>&#x2018;you<SUB>PL.ACC</SUB>&#x2019;. They seem to be composed of the inessive forms <italic>benn-&#x00FC;nk </italic>&#x2018;in us&#x2019; and <italic>benn-etek </italic>&#x2018;in you&#x2019;, to which the accusative ending attaches. I do not discuss these variants here any further, but they can plausibly be analysed as differing from the variants <italic>minket </italic>&#x2018;us&#x2019; and <italic>titeket </italic>&#x2018;you<SUB>PL.ACC</SUB>&#x2019; in the presence of the root.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>The null NP representing null arguments in Panagiotidis (2003) and Barbosa (2017) is also taken by them to be the lowest projection in the structure of pronouns.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>head contains the gender feature in Polish and in English (at least in third person). As Hungarian does not make gender distinctions at all, <italic>n </italic>in Hungarian does not contain gender. Pronouns in the three languages considered here contain also the Num head and the structure is closed off by the KP projection.</p>
<p>The three languages differ as far as the Pers and D heads are concerned. Following, among others, Corver (1990) and Willim (2000), as discussed in section 1.4 of chapter 1, I take Polish to lack D in its lexicon and hence, D is lacking in the structure of pronouns in Polish. Both English and Hungarian have overt articles, hence they have D. I thus take personal pronouns in English and in Hungarian to include the DP projection (cf. Postal 1969 and subsequent work by Ritter 1995, among others). For English, there is no evidence suggesting that there is a separate Pers head in nominal projections, which is why I take the person feature to be included in the D head in this language.</p>
<p>Pronouns in English and Polish are fusional. The morphological structure of pronouns in Hungarian is complex, as in the first and second person accusative the pronouns include two morphemes encoding the person and number features. I show this in Table 3.3, which also presents the nominative forms for comparison.</p>
<p>I take the additional person/number marker to be a reflection of a set of unvalued person and number features on the D head in Hungarian, undergoing an agreement operation with the valued features of person and number on the Pers</p>

<p>Table 3.3: The segmentation of <sc>nom </sc>and <sc>acc </sc>personal pronouns in Hungarian and Num heads (e.g. via Agree).<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>4Recently H&#x00F6;hn (2016) has employed phrases such as <italic>we linguists </italic>in various languages with articles as a diagnostic for the structure of pronouns. He suggests that in languages which pattern with English in excluding the article from such phrases, the pronoun realises D, which encodes both definiteness and person ([<SUB>DP</SUB> D [<sub>NumP</sub> Num <italic>[<sub>nP</sub> </italic>N/eN]]]). In languages such as Greek, where the pronoun is followed first by the article and only then by the noun (e.g. <italic>emeis oi glossologoi </italic>&#x2018;we thePL linguists&#x2019;), Person takes a DP complement ([<sub>Pers</sub>P Pers [<SUB>DP</SUB> D [<sub>NumP </sub>Num [<sub><italic>n</italic>P</sub> N/eN]]]]) and the pronoun realises Person (which agrees with Num for the number feature). Broadly speaking, this approach is compatible with the present one in that it argues that languages can differ in whether they encode the person and definiteness features on a single head or on two distinct heads. However, H&#x00F6;hn (2016) classifies Hungarian together with English as a language lacking a separate Pers head, contra the present analysis. This is due to the fact that Hungarian is parallel to English in disallowing the definite article in structures of the <italic>we linguists </italic>type <italic>((*a) mi (*a) di&#x00E1;kok </italic>&#x2018;(the) we (the) students&#x2019;). However, it is hard to see how this analysis could account for the full range of the Hungarian data.</p>
<p>One problematic factor is the presence of two sets of person/number markers in the accusative case, which would somehow need to be accommodated within the structure [<SUB>DP</SUB> D [<sub>NumP</sub> Num <italic><BOLD>U </BOLD></italic>N/eN]]]. Furthermore, according to my informant, in the accusative context the <italic>formmi-nk-et di&#x00E1;k-ok-at </italic>&#x2018;we-1PL-ACC student-PL-ACc&#x2019;(&#x2018;us students&#x2019;) is used, where, just as when it functions on its own, the pronoun is marked for person/number twice and bears case marking (special thanks to M&#x00E1;t&#x00E9; Vince for this piece of data). The article, which uncontroversially is D, is never marked with the accusative morpheme (<italic>*a-tdi&#x00E1;k-ot </italic>&#x2018;the-ACC student-Ace&#x2019;). A subset of Hungarian demonstratives agrees with the head noun in number and case (e.g. <italic>ez-et a di&#x00E1;k-ot </italic>&#x2018;this-ACC the student-Ace&#x2019;), but assimilating pronouns with these demonstratives leaves the presence of the article in the latter but not the former case unexplained. Non-agreeing demonstratives do not co-occur with the article (unless separated by additional material, e.g. <italic>(*az) emejavaslat </italic>&#x2018;(the) this proposal&#x2019; vs. <italic>*(a) [tegnap el&#x0151;adott] emejavaslat </italic>&#x2018;(the) yesterday presented this proposal&#x2019; (&#x2018;this proposal presented yesterday&#x2019;); see D&#x00E9;k&#x00E1;ny 2011 and references cited therein for discussions), but they also do not bear case markers. Whatever the right analysis of this structure will turn out to be, it seems unlikely that the lack of the article in phrases such as <italic>mi di&#x00E1;kok </italic>&#x2018;we students&#x2019; can be treated as evidence for the [<SUB>DP</SUB> D [<sub>NumP</sub> Num <italic>[<sub>nP</sub> </italic>N/eN]]] structure of pronouns, the pronoun</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>I illustrate the structures which I propose here for the first-person plural pronouns in (2)&#x2013;(4).</p>

<p>As I have noted in section 2.2.1 of chapter 2, on the assumption that the pronouns <italic>she </italic>and <italic>he </italic>in forms such as <italic>she-goat </italic>can be taken to realise the <italic>n </italic>head bearing feminine or masculine gender, such an <italic>n </italic>head can be taken to be present in the structure of third-person pronouns by analogy. As both number <italic>(she </italic>vs. <italic>they) </italic>and case <italic>(she </italic>vs. <italic>her), </italic>have an effect on the way in which the structure including <italic>n<sub>[G:F</sub></italic><sub>/M]</sub> is ultimately realised, <italic>n </italic>can be taken to move to the successive heads in pronouns. Pronominal forms in English can thus be taken to realise the complex head <italic>n</italic><sub>([G:F/</sub>M/N<sub>]</sub>)-Num<sub>[SG/</sub>P<SUB>L]</SUB>-D<sub>[Pers]</sub>-K. Similarly, head movement can be assumed for Polish, where all pronominal forms are also fusional.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><sup>5</sup>D&#x00E9;chaine &#x0026; Wiltschko (2002) propose that there is a structural difference between the first/second-person and the third person pronouns in English. They analyse the former as DPs, but the latter as &#x03C6;Ps. Adopting this proposal would not have a bearing on the analysis of missing objects suggested here, but the motivation for such a split does not seem very strong. The crucial</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>In addition to the cross-linguistic structural differences, there is a clear morphological difference between first/second-person and third-person pronouns in Hungarian (see Table 3.3). In particular, whereas first/second-person pronouns contain two sets of fusional person/number markers in the accusative case <italic>(mi-nk-et </italic>&#x2018;we-1PL-AcC), third-person pronouns are clearly agglutinative, with three distinct morphemes encoding person, number, and case ( <italic>&#x0151;-k-et </italic>&#x2018;she/he-PL-Acc&#x2019;).<sup>6 </sup>This difference can be accounted for in the following way. In third-person pronouns in Hungarian, Pers moves to D and the Pers-D complex is interpreted at the level of morphology as <italic>&#x0151; </italic>&#x2018;she/he&#x2019;. In first/second-person pronouns, the Num head moves to Pers, forming a complex Num-Pers head, interpreted at the level of morphology as the suffixes <italic>-em, -ed, -nk, </italic>and <italic>-tek </italic>for first and second person singular and first and second person plural respectively. The D head, bearing unvalued person and number features, which are valued, for example, by Agree</p>
<p>argumentfromthefamiliarcontrastbetweentheacceptabilityofphrasessuchas<italic>we/you linguists </italic>and <italic>*they linguists </italic>does not carry over to singular number, where the pronoun+noun structure is unacceptable regardless of person and, further, the contrast is in fact not explained by the analysis in D&#x00E9;chaine &#x0026; Wiltschko (2002), as in both cases the noun <italic>linguists </italic>is an NP complement of &#x03C6;, with D becoming relevant only later in the derivation.</p>
<p>On the current approach, where the <italic>n </italic>head composes both lexical nouns and contributes gender included in the structure of third-person pronouns, the contrast between <italic>we/you linguists </italic>and <italic>*they linguists </italic>can be captured <italic>if we/you </italic>realise the D-K complex, making it possible for <italic>linguists </italic>to realise the &#x221A;uNGUiST-<italic>n</italic>-Num complex, but <italic>they </italic>realises the <italic>n</italic>-Num-D-K complex, whose <italic>n</italic>-Num part is already occupied by the root. The unacceptability of <italic>*I/you<SUB>SG</SUB> linguist </italic>still awaits an explanation. One possibility is to consider it as a semantic effect arising from an attempt at modifying the speaker/hearer directly, evaded in the plural, where what is modified is a group including the speaker/hearer.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>These number and case markers are the same as the ones surfacing on lexical nouns (e.g. <italic>sz&#x0151;l&#x0151;-k-et</italic>&#x2019;grape-PL-AcC).</p>

<p>The case marker, both in pronouns and in lexical noun phrases, is linearised as the final morpheme.

<p>Whenever the pronominal structures presented above are merged in argument positions, they are overt and the languages interpret them at the SM interface in accordance with their pronominal paradigms. To derive missing argument structures, either a representational difference between overt pronouns and missing arguments needs to be posited, or additional operations need to be involved (e.g. deletion). Even though both strategies may in principle be needed to account for the properties of definite missing objects in different languages, in what follows I show that the former option is adequate to account for the data from the languages</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>which are the focus here.</p>

<label>3.3</label>
<title>Definite missing objects: syntactic representation, silence, and interpretation</title>
<p>In chapter 2, I have hypothesised that the object position is occupied by the <italic>n </italic>head in structures with indefinite missing objects. In English and Hungarian the <italic>n </italic>head need not be associated with phonemic features. In Polish, a system with grammatical gender, <italic>n </italic>contains the gender feature, which is realised as a fusional gender/number/case morpheme in overt structures.<sup>7</sup> What makes it possible for <italic>n </italic>to be zero-realised in Polish in contexts with missing objects is the lack of the K and Num heads in the structure, the language lacking instructions for overt realisation <italic>ofn </italic>containing gender in the absence of information about number and case. This approach makes it possible to account for the null Spell-Out of objects represented as <italic>n </italic>in the three languages discussed here.</p>
<p>On the side of the C-I interface, I have argued in the previous chapter that indefinite missing objects represented as <italic>n </italic>are interpreted with the same mechanism which is used for the interpretation of mass nouns, such as the operation Restrict. I have postulated that the basic denotation of the <italic>n </italic>head is Ay.T <sc>ee </sc>y = y.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup>This morpheme is zero-realised in some cases, as in the genitive plural form <italic>of kobiet-a </italic>&#x2018;woman-F.SG.NOM&#x2019;, that is <italic>kobiet-&#x00F8; </italic>&#x2018;woman-F.PL.GEN&#x2019;.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>This means that whether an object represented as <italic>n </italic>can be interpreted as definite depends on whether there is a semantic mechanism in a language which makes definite interpretation of an <italic>&#x27E8;</italic>e,t<italic>&#x27E9;</italic>-type expression possible. If not, the structure of a definite object has to be larger, including D, which on standard assumptions is a lexical item performing the function of shifting a predicate to an individual. The analyses of English, Polish, and Hungarian presented respectively in the three sections which follow take definite missing objects in the first two languages to involve the former option. On the other hand, Hungarian data seem to be compatible only with the latter possibility.</p>

<title>Definite missing objects in English</title>
<p>The availability of definite missing objects in English is determined lexically (see chapter 1 and chapter 5). The way in which the referent of the object is identified is largely dependent on discourse factors, as (9)&#x2013;(11) from Cote (1996:155&#x2013;156) illustrate.</p>

<p>In addition, the interpretation of the object is in this case more flexible than what is observed with overt pronouns, as I show in (12), where (12a) is likely to trigger a response such as (12b), but where (12c) is more likely to be followed by (12d) (see Williams 2012:137; see also section 4.3 of chapter 4).</p>

<p>I propose to encode this difference between pronouns and missing objects by taking the structural representation of the object to be truncated with respect to the representation of the overt pronoun. More specifically, definite missing objects are represented in the grammar of English as <italic>n</italic>, that is they are representationally identical to indefinite missing objects (cf. chapter 2). This accounts for the silence of the object, <italic>n </italic>being null independently. The pronominal object in (12a) can thus be represented as in (13a), whereas the null object in (12c) is represented as in (13b).</p>

<p>As the proposed denotation of the <italic>n </italic>head is Ay.T <sc>ee </sc>y = y, definite interpretation of the object needs to be achieved by the application of <sc><italic>l, </italic></sc>shifting the denotation of the object to type (e).<sup>8</sup> This derives a semantic representation which has in fact been proposed for the null object of the verb <italic>win </italic>in Williams (2012), as shown in (14).</p>

<p>If this is correct, the problem of the type of lexical information which distinguishes verbs which can be used with definite missing objects from the ones which cannot can be viewed as a matter of interpretations available to (e,t)-type objects. In particular, lexical entries of verbs such as <italic>win </italic>and <italic>visit </italic>specify that their complement can undergo type shifting with <italic>i </italic>in the semantics. Verbs which do not make definite missing objects available lack this property, enforcing that their complement projects a DP structure to be interpreted as definite.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup>8</sup>Barbosa (2017) analyses subject<italic>pro</italic>-drop in partial <italic>pro </italic>-drop and discourse<italic>pro</italic>-drop languages by suggesting that the subject position is occupied by a null NP/ <italic>n </italic>P. This null NP/<italic>n</italic>P is also taken to be interpreted via the application of <sub><bold>t</bold></sub>.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>The structural representation and interpretation of the missing object effectively makes it</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>The suggestion that a property pertaining to interpretation of a nominal argument is encoded on the verb follows the strand of research postulating nominal features on verbal functional heads, such as the D-/nominal-feature on <italic>v </italic>and T in Chomsky (1995), triggering movement when strong, and the D-feature on I in Holmberg (2005), introducing definiteness. However, on the present account information encoded in the verbal entry is not directly related to movement and/or definite readings and does not constrain the interpretation of overt objects. Rather, it encodes the availability of an additional interpretive mechanisms, that is <italic><bold>i</bold>. </italic>Some further support for this analysis is presented in section 6.2 of the concluding chapter, where missing objects are discussed in relation to problems of language acquisition.</p>
<p>Wrapping up, definite object drop in English can be accounted for on the assumption that the object position is occupied by an <italic>n, </italic>interpreted by the application of <italic><bold>i</bold>. </italic>The merge of an <italic>n </italic>in the object position yields a well-formed result</p>

<title>Definite missing objects in Polish</title>
<p>From the point of view of the C-I interface, Polish is equipped to make definite interpretation of an object <italic>n </italic>available. It makes extensive use of bare noun arguments, which can be interpreted as definite, with guidance from the features of the surrounding text (see (15)), or some wider context, including the speaker&#x2019;s and hearer&#x2019;s shared knowledge (see (16)), and situational context (see (17); see Turkowska1981:51).<sup>10</sup></p>

Lacking (a null) D projection, this yields an expression of type <italic>&#x27E8;</italic>e,t<italic>&#x27E9;</italic>, which is an appropriate type of input for <italic>&#x03B9;</italic>.</p>

<p>Just as in English, definite missing objects in Polish are more flexible than overt pronominals in terms of interpretation:</p>
<list id="q_19" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(19)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_19a"><label>a.</label><p>Posz&#x0142;am na bal i go wygra&#x0142;am. went-1SG.Fonballandhimwon-1SG.F &#x2018;I went to the/a ball and won it.&#x2019;</p>

<p>In (19a) the pronominal is interpreted as coreferential with <italic>bal </italic>&#x2018;ball&#x2019;. The missing object in (19b) invites the interpretation according to which a game or a competition of some sort took place during the ball. The similarity between the interpretive properties of definite missing objects in English and in Polish suggest that the same analysis should be applicable to Polish. In particular, the missing</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>object is represented as <italic>n </italic>and is interpreted via <italic><bold>i</bold>. </italic>Lacking the Num and K projections, the object is null, just as in the indefinite contexts. As Polish makes the application of <italic><bold>i </bold></italic>freely available, definite missing objects are not constrained lexically in Polish.</p>
<p>The analysis is now faced with the question about the nature of restrictions on the use of definite missing objects in Polish. As discussed more fully in section 4.3.1 of chapter 4, definite missing objects in Polish can usually be substituted with overt pronominals, but the opposite is not true, as there are a number of environments where null objects are unacceptable in Polish (see (20) from McShane 1999:64).</p>
<list id="q_20" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>ate-1SG three dumplings-Ace alone them-Acc made-1sc &#x2018;I ate three dumplings. I made them myself.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>It seems that the only types of contexts in which the missing object cannot be replaced with a pronominal is when the pronominal has to be interpreted as coreferential with a noun phrase in the preceding context (see (19)). This contrast follows from the greater interpretive flexibility of missing objects in comparison with overt pronouns. This can be taken to result from a structural difference and, in particular, from the absence of the Pers head in the structure of definite miss-</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>ing objects, on the hypothesis that the person feature in Polish enforces reference to an antecedent in the preceding linguistic context or to an extra-linguistic one. The sentence in (20) thus constitutes a prototypical context for the use of an overt pronominal in Polish.</p>
<p>The reason why overt pronominals are frequently preferable to missing objects and are sometimes the only available option in Polish may be related to an observation made in McShane (1999). In particular, in her comparative study of accusative direct object drop in Czech, Polish, and Russian, McShane (1999) notes that the acceptability of object drop in the three languages correlates inversely with the development of the pronominal (clitic) system. Czech is the least permissive of the three languages as far as object drop is concerned and has the most developed clitic system. Russian is the most permissive in object drop and has the least developed clitic system and Polish is in between with respect to both these features of the grammar. It thus seems that the availability of weak/clitic pronouns influences the degree of acceptability of definite missing objects. The reason for this might be the preference for encoding interpretation directly in syntactic computation by including the Pers and Num heads, rather than resorting to inferential processes, involved in arriving at the relevant interpretation of an object represented as <italic>n</italic>.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The facts might be amenable to an analysis involving an economy metric in the spirit of Reuland (2001).</p>

<title>Definite missing objects in Hungarian</title>
<p>The data in (21)&#x2013;(22), adapted from Farkas &#x0026; de Swart (2003:135&#x2013;137), illustrate the basic pattern of definite object drop in Hungarian. In particular, only singular objects can be dropped (though see section 3.3.3.3 below).</p>

<p>Farkas (1987) observes that definite null objects are not restricted lexically in Hungarian and shows that they can act as controllers (see (23) from Farkas 1987:193) and are not reflexive anaphors (see (24) from Farkas 1987:193). This leads her to analyse them as instances of <italic>pro</italic>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Lipt&#x00E1;k (2013:82) shows that null objects of this type can only have a strict reading in Hungarian, similarly to overt pronouns:<sup>12</sup></p>

<p><sup>12</sup>The so-called strict/sloppy reading ambiguity effect, illustrated here in (i), quoted after Kim (1999:255), is an issue which has received a significant amount of attention in the literature on the identity of missing objects.</p>
<p>(i) Peter likes his picture, and Joan does [<SUB>VP</SUB> e] too.</p>

<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Joan likes his (= Peter&#x2019;s) picture.	[strict identity]</p>
<p>Pronominal dependencies in the elliptical clause in (i) can be resolved in two ways, with the understood possessive referring either to the subject of the elliptical clause or to the subject of the antecedent clause. The availability of the sloppy reading has been taken to be indicative of ellipsis of a larger structure also in analyses of missing object constructions (e.g. VP ellipsis of the V-stranding type or full NP/DP ellipsis). As a diagnostic for VP ellipsis, the strict/sloppy reading ambiguity effect has been used both to argue in favour of the VP-ellipsis analysis of data with missing objects in different languages (see Huang 1991; Otani &#x0026; Whitman 1991; Cyrino &#x0026; Lopes 2012) as well as against it (see Hoji 1998; Bailyn 2011). In addition, some recent analyses propose to derive the strict/sloppy reading ambiguity from NP/DP ellipsis rather than the ellipsis of the entire VP (see, e.g., &#x015E;ener &#x0026; Takahashi 2010; Duguine 2014; cf. also Erteschik-Shir, Ibnbari &#x0026; Taube 2013 for a different approach). The strength of the argument from the strict/sloppy reading ambiguity is weakened by the observation that sloppy readings are sometimes available outside the domain of ellipsis (see, e.g., Tancredi 1992 and Runi&#x0107; 2013). This does not affect the argument that the lack of the availability of the sloppy reading points towards a pronominal analysis.</p>

<p>[Hungarian]</p>
<p>That definite missing objects in Hungarian are interpreted as rigidly as overt pronouns is further supported by their behaviour in the context where the missing object in English and Polish reveals interpretive flexibility. In particular, according to my informants, the missing object in (26) has to be interpreted as the meeting.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The pattern of object drop which does not enforce co-reference of the object with the meeting is as in (i). However, this is an instance of indefinite object drop, as revealed by verbal morphology when the subject is second person (see (ii); in first person the marking on the verb is syncretic between the definite and indefinite conjugation; see section 3.3.3.1 for more discussion oftheconjugational patterns).</p>

<p>I take the data to show that, unlike in English and Polish, the structural representation of definite missing objects and overt pronouns is similar in Hungarian. I suggest that both of them contain the <italic>n</italic>, Num, Pers, and D heads. An additional piece of data suggesting that definite missing objects in Hungarian cannot be represented as <italic>n </italic>is provided by some properties of Hungarian verbal conjugation, discussed in the following section.</p>
<p><italic>3.3.3.1 Missing objects and verbal conjugation</italic></p>
<p>Briefly speaking, Hungarian has two conjugational paradigms, the choice between which is conditioned by the features of the object (and the subject). I provide the present tense conjugational paradigms in Table 3.4 for illustration and exemplify them in (27) from Bartos (1999:97).<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup>14</sup>I provide the paradigms here after Kiefer (2003). The choice of the linking vowels in the paradigms, indicated by the capital letters, is determined by rules of vowel harmony. The capital letter <ITALIC>V </ITALIC>stands for the distinction made between back and front and rounded and unrounded vowels. Hence, the <italic>-Vk </italic>suffix can be realised as <italic>-ok, -ek</italic>, or <italic>-&#x00F6;k</italic>. In the case of the capital letters <ITALIC>A </ITALIC>and <ITALIC>U</ITALIC>, there are only the back and the front vowel variants.</p>
<p>Various allomorphs distinguish between the two paradigms by means of additional vocalic melody (<italic>-(j)a/-j/-i/-e</italic>; see, e.g, &#x00C9;. Kiss 2005). Apart from the agreement markings for the first and second person singular in the indefinite and the definite conjugation (i.e. <italic>-Vk </italic>and <italic>-(A)sz, -Vl </italic>vs. <italic>-Vm </italic>and <italic>-Vd</italic>), which do not stand in the agglutinative relation to one another, the definite conjugation markers can be analysed as combinations of subject markers found in the indefinite paradigm and an additional morpheme (see den Dikken 2006). The distinct conjugational marking <italic>-lAk </italic>is used when the subject is first person singular and the object is second person.</p>

<p>The selection of a particular inflectional ending on the verb is determined by the &#x03C6;-features of the subject (person and number, Hungarian lacking grammat-icalised gender) and by the specification of the object, if present. The exact feature(s) of the object which trigger the use of the definite conjugation (e.g. definiteness, specificity, person agreement) are a subject of heated debates (see, among others, Dalmi 1998; Bartos 1999; &#x00C9;. Kiss 2005, 2013; Coppock &#x0026; Wechsler 2012; Coppock 2013; Rocquet 2013; B&#x00E1;r&#x00E1;ny 2015). Settling this debate is not of direct relevance to the present discussion and cannot be attempted here. However, two aspects of the definite conjugation are important for analyses of object drop in Hungarian.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>Firstly, definite missing objects trigger the use of the same conjugational patterns as overt pronouns (i.e. both are used with the definite conjugation, modulo the effects attributed to the Inverse Agreement Constraint in &#x00C9;. Kiss 2005, 2013).<sup>15</sup> On theotherhand,barenounobjects are used with the indefinite paradigm, as shown in (28).</p>

<p>This piece of data has been taken to show that the definite conjugation is the crucial factor licensing object drop in Hungarian. &#x00C9;. Kiss (2012) suggests even that the licensing of null objects is the primary function of the definite conjugation in Modern Hungarian.<sup>16</sup> The unavailability of plural object drop has been attributed to the fact that the plural-number feature cannot be recovered from the shape of verbal inflection (see esp. Farkas &#x0026; de Swart 2003; &#x00C9;. Kiss 2012). In particular, Farkas &#x0026; de Swart (2003) adopt the approach according to which &#x03C6;-features of null pronouns must be recoverable from verbal morphology.<sup>17</sup> They attribute the unacceptability of plural null objects to the fact that the morphological shape of verb forms in Hungarian does not make it possible for the plural-number feature to be recovered for null objects (see (29)). Since Farkas &#x0026; de Swart (2003) take singular nominals to lack the number feature altogether, singular null objects are</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>In the course of the diachronic development of the language, this has not always been the case. &#x00C9;. Kiss (2012) observes that even though the definite conjugation is attested in the earliest written sources, null objects are only sporadically found in Old Hungarian (before AD 1526) and have become widely used only in Modern Hungarian (after 1772), and especially in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>acceptable (there is no need for their number to be recovered, singular pronouns and DPs not being marked for number at all on their analysis). However, there are some empirical problems with this proposal.</p>
<p>Firstly, in structures such as (30a) the modal auxiliary <italic>kell </italic>&#x2018;need&#x2019; does not conjugate and the infinitive <italic>&#x00FA;j&#x00ED;tanom </italic>&#x2018;extend&#x2019; bears only subject agreement marking. Even though no piece of verbal morphology provides any information about the null object, not even about the presence of an object in the structure, singular object drop is available. What is more, just as in structures with conjugated lexical verbs, plural object drop is blocked (see (30b)).<sup>18</sup></p>

<p>ments but which do not have the definite paradigm. In short, in Hungarian the morphology of finite matrix verbs is sensitive to the features of the object of their infinitival complements. Accordingly, when the object is headed by the definite article, the matrix verb bears the definite conjugation marking, as in (31a), but when the object is headed by the indefinite article, the verb bears the indefinite conjugation marking, as in (31b) (Bartos 1999:112).</p>

<p>Secondly, in structures with a third-person subject and indefinite conjugation (required when the subject is third person and the object is first/second person), null objects are acceptable and can be interpreted as either first or second person without this being reflected in verbal morphology, as (33) shows. If object drop in Hungarian were dependent on the recoverability of &#x03C6; features, it is unclear why there should be no need for the person feature to be recoverable from verbal morphology, if the number feature needs to be.</p>

<p>Thirdly, first/second-person plural objects can be dropped in a right context, even if the result is somewhat degraded in comparison with singular object drop, as illustrated in (34) from Keresztes (2013:56) (see section 3.3.3.3 for further</p>

<p>discussion of these data). Again, it is unclear why the plural-number feature should not have to be recoverable with first/second-person objects if it needs to be with third-person objects.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the above data speaking against the proposal relating definite object drop in Hungarian to the notion of the recoverability of the number feature, I suggest an alternative analysis in the following sections. Section 3.3.3.2 discusses third-person objects, focusing on the blocking effect observed with plural objects and section 3.3.3.3 shows how the analysis can be extended to account for the data with first and second person.</p>
<p><italic>3.3.3.2 [PL] marker as the blocking factor</italic></p>
<p>The basic pattern of definite object drop in Hungarian which needs to be accounted for is that, in the third person, only singular objects can be dropped:</p>

<p>I suggest that, rather than being an effect of semantic recoverability, the blocking factor observed in (36) is morphological in nature and is related to the requirement of the plural-number marker <italic>-k </italic>to have a host to attach to.</p>
<p>The plural marker in Hungarian has the interesting property that it can attach to hosts of various categories in the absence of a lexical noun. For example, in DP-internal ellipsis with an adjectival remnant, the stranded plural marker and case marker attach to the adjective:</p>
<list id="q_37" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(37)</label><p>

<p>132</p>
<p>&#x2018;I wanted the green (ones).&#x2019;	[Hungarian]</p>
<p>In fact, these markers can attach to any remaining DP-internal modifier, including numerals, classifiers, and complex phrasal modifiers such as passive participle clauses, as in (38) from Lipt&#x00E1;k &#x0026; Saab (2015:21).</p>

<p>The markers surfacing on non-nominal hosts in the elliptical contexts are best analysed as the same elements which surface attached to the lexical noun in non-elliptical contexts, that is as realisations of Num and K (cf. Lipt&#x00E1;k &#x0026; Saab 2015 and Ruda 2016). In overt pronouns, the plural marker attaches to the morpheme <italic>&#x00D6; </italic>&#x2018;she/he&#x2019;, analysed in section 3.2 above as the realisation of the Pers-D complex head:</p>

<list-item><label>(39)</label><p><italic>The structure of </italic>&#x0151;-k-et <italic>them&#x2019;	</italic>[Hungarian]</p>
<p>I suggest that definite object drop in Hungarian is in fact the drop of the complex D-Pers head, that is, it is a consequence of the non-realisation of the feature set dominated by the branching D node. In the absence of the morpheme <italic>&#x0151; </italic>&#x2018;she/he&#x2019;, the plural marker <italic>-k </italic>is left stranded, without having any possible host within the projection of the pronoun. This results in the structure being ill-formed at the SM interface, explaining the unacceptability of omitting a definite plural object.<sup>20</sup> In the case of singular objects, the number feature is either absent from</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>As far as the omission of pronominal subjects is concerned, Hungarian is a canonical <italic>pro-drop </italic>language and subjects of all persons and numbers are dropped. This difference in constraints on subject and object drop suggests that the two require different approaches. In principle, any</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>the structure altogether (see Farkas &#x0026; de Swart 2003) or is unrealised in the mor-phophonological component, which is why no violation obtains when the D-Pers head is unrealised with singular number.</p>
<p>In line with the analysis of missing objects in English and Polish outlined above, I take missing objects in Hungarian to lack the K head. This hypothesis aligns well with the morphological approach to the patterns of object drop in Hungarian: unlike the plural marker, the accusative case marker usually realised overtly as <italic>-(V)t </italic>does not have an effect on the acceptability of missing objects; otherwise dropping third-person singular objects should be blocked by the presence of the stranded accusative marker (cf. <italic>&#x0151;-t </italic>&#x2018;she/he-Acc&#x2019;).</p>
<p>The hypothesis postulating a caseless noun phrase is not unfamiliar in the literature on Hungarian. For example, so-called nominative possessors, exemplified in (40), have been taken to lack the case feature (see, a.o., &#x00C9;. Kiss 2002;</p>
<p>D&#x00E9;k&#x00E1;ny2011).<sup>21</sup></p>
<p>analysis of<italic>pro-</italic>drop in rich agreement systems should be able to account for the Hungarian subject drop data (see, e.g., Roberts 2010; Barbosa 2017 and references therein for discussions and proposals). The focus of this work being on object drop, issues related to subject drop will not be discussed further here.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Furthermore, the accusative marker on first/second-person singular (but not plural) pronouns and certain lexical noun phrases is optional in Hungarian (see, e.g., Kenesei et al. 1998 for a discussion of the patterns):</p>
<p>(i)	a. eng-em(-et),t&#x00E9;g-ed(-et)</p>

<p>The present approach is thus also congruent with the picture of nominal structures in Hungarian emerging from the existing theoretical literature. For concreteness, I suggest (41) as the structural representation of the acceptable singular missing object in Hungarian. The structure in (42) presents a potential representation of a plural missing object. This structure leads to an illegitimate morphophonological representation due to the presence of the overt marker <italic>-k</italic>, which realises the Num head.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;my/your tear&#x2019;	[Hungarian]</p>
<p>This can result either from the optionality of the K head in the relevant contexts or from an application of a morphological impoverishment rule (e.g. such as the one in (ii)). If the latter option is operative in Hungarian, another analytical possibility to account for the lack of effect of the accusative marker on object drop in Hungarian is to take the rule in (ii) to be extended to contexts in which D-Pers is unrealised, perhaps as a last-resort operation rescuing the structure from resulting in ill-formedness due to a stranded case marker. As no rule parallel to (ii) is available for the plural marker, the marker has to be realised overtly whenever the plural feature is present in the structure. Since this solution seems less parsimonious than not merging the K head at all, the latter option should be assumed, unless it can be shown to be inadequate.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>If singular number is in fact the lack of number in Hungarian (see Farkas &#x0026; de Swart 2003), the structure in (ia) needs to be modified by removing the NumP projection. This modification does not have a bearing on the present discussion.</p>

<p>person plural objects, which is clearly unacceptable, omitting first/second-person plural objects is not ruled out. The study reported in Keresztes (2013) shows that the omission of a first-person plural object is judged almost as acceptable as singular object drop. The omission of a second-person plural object is felt to be somewhat degraded in comparison with first-person plural object drop, but it is still acceptable (as determined by judgments expressed on a 7-point scale).

<p>The difference between the structure in (45) and the structure proposed for third-person pronouns is that in this case, the Num head is not realised separately, since it moves to Pers. Just as is the case with third-person missing objects, the K head</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>can be taken to be missing in the structure of first/second-person missing objects. Rules similar to the rule for the realisation of the D-Pers complex postulated in (43) for third person can now be suggested for the structures with first and second person.

<p>The rules in (46)-(47), combined with the hypothesis that missing objects lack the K head in their structure, derive the availability of both singular and plural object drop in first and second person, as opposed to the third person.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p><sup>25</sup> Accounting for the difference in the degree of acceptability of first and second person plural missing objects noted inKeresztes (2013) requires further empirical and theoretical investigation (dropping the latter seems less acceptable than dropping the former). One possible direction</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>To sum up, this section has analysed the restrictions on definite missing objects in Hungarian in terms of the morphophonological properties of the language. Taking missing objects in Hungarian to parallel pronominal structures up to the DP projection but to lack the K head makes it possible to capture the asymmetries in the availability of object drop, which are determined by the morphological realisations of &#x03C6; features distributed in pronominal structures. I have analysed the unacceptability of third-person plural missing objects as a consequence of the lack of an appropriate host to which the plural marker <italic>-k </italic>could attach. As firstperson and second-person plural pronouns have an analysis on which the Num head is not realised independently, but is a part of a complex Pers-Num head, plural number does not block object drop in this case.</p>
<p>The system developed here thus proposes a structural difference between definite missing objects in English and Polish on the one hand and in Hungarian on the other. Whereas I have analysed definite missing objects in English and Polish as represented as <italic>n</italic>, being interpreted as definite due to the application of</p>
<p>the operation <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>in the semantics, I have taken Hungarian definite objects to be</p>
<p>for future research might be to see whether this difference can be attributed to an interpretive difference between first and second person pronouns: even though both are potentially ambiguous between two interpretations, that is the speaker and her/his associates vs. a plurality of speakers and the hearer and her/his associates vs. a plurality of hearers, contexts where the plurality of speakers is an appropriate interpretation are much more restricted than contexts in which the plurality of hearers is meant. Resolving ambiguity can thus be more difficult for second-person pronouns than for first-person pronouns. See, for example, Wechsler (2010) and references cited therein for relevant discussions.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>DPs. This difference is reflected in the data, which show that missing objects are more flexible in terms of interpretation than overt pronouns only in the two former languages (cf. the examples in (12), (19), and (26)). This type of analysis is available on the assumption that definite interpretation of a nominal argument does not require the presence of the D head in the syntactic representation, as discussed in section 1.4 of chapter 1. In the following section, I consider briefly the alternative on which the D head is obligatory for the definite reading to arise.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2>
<label>3.3.4</label>
<title>An alternative: null D in English and Polish</title>
<p>Two kinds of approaches developed in the literature about the interpretation of nominal expressions in natural language grammar are in principle available to account for the definite interpretation of missing objects (cf. the discussions in Corver 1990; Longobardi 1994; Chierchia 1998; Progovac 1998; Willim 2000; Rutkowski 2002; Bo&#x0161;kovi&#x0107; 2008, 2012; Jiang 2012; Fanselow &#x0026; F&#x00E9;ry 2013; Pereltsvaig 2013, among others). According to one of them, an expression of type <italic>&#x27E8;</italic>e,t<italic>&#x27E9; </italic>can undergo a type shifting operation in the semantic component (<italic>&#x03B9;</italic>). This operation is not associated with any syntactic head, making it possible to take the syntactic representation of the object to be minimal (i.e. <italic>n </italic>on the current proposal). An alternative to applying <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>in the semantics is to adopt the hypothesis that definite interpretation is only possible via mediation of a dedicated lexical</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>item merged within the projection of an argument (i.e. D).<sup>26</sup> I have adopted the former view in the present work, as discussed in section 1.4 of chapter 1.<sup>27</sup> On the latter view, the structure of definite missing objects would need to include at least the <italic>n </italic>and D heads (see (48)), and possibly also the Num head, if D is taken to select for Num.</p>

<list-item><label>(48)</label><p>[<SUB>DP</SUB> D-&#x00F8; [<italic>n</italic>-&#x00F8;]]</p>
<p>The postulation of a null D raises some non-trivial issues for the analysis of Polish and English. Polish does not have overt lexical items which can be analysed as equivalents of the English articles. Furthermore, it lacks any overt evidence for the presence of a null D head in the structure (see Willim 2000). Assuming the structure in (48) and, naturally, adopting also the hypothesis that definite lexical noun phrases are also DPs in this language would have serious theoretical consequences. In particular, due to the lack of evidence which could lead a language acquirer to postulate a null D head in the lexicon, information about the existence of this head would need to be part of innate language-specific knowledge. This is not an optimal solution, as in languages with articles the</p>
<p>dependence between definite interpretation and the presence of an article in the</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>I thank Tonia Bleam for a discussion of this option.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>See also section 6.2 in the concluding chapter for a discussion of some consequences for the theory of language acquisition.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>structure can be acquired based on primary linguistic data.</p>
<p>The major problem related to the analysis of missing objects as (48) in English is more basic. Even taking for granted that a child could acquire a null article, in addition to the overt ones, it is still unclear why this null article should not be able to take an <italic>n</italic>P/NumP complement containing a lexical noun. Furthermore, it is unclear how lexical restrictions on the use of definite missing objects could be encoded in this case. The categorial identity of the missing object would be the same as the categorial identity of overt objects, which means that any transitive verb selecting for nominal complements should be able to be merged with an object represented as shown in (48).<sup>28</sup> Even though some solutions to these problems might be available, they would introduce further complications in the theory of missing arguments, in addition to complicating UG. Representing all definite missing objects as shown in (48) thus seems theoretically unattractive, as it does not take into account the properties of objects in particular languages and the broader properties of the systems of nominal interpretation in these languages.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>This is also the case on the analysis which takes the highest projection of noun phrases to be KP, as K should be able to select a DP complement regardless whether D is null or overt.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p><bold>3.4 Definite missing objects as <italic>n </italic>or DP: conclusion</bold></p>
<p>Taking the view that the structure of a missing object minimally includes the nominal categorising head <italic>n </italic>as the point of departure, the present chapter has modelled definite missing objects in English, Polish, and Hungarian with reference to the structure of pronouns in these languages. In the former two languages such objects exhibit subtle interpretive differences when compared with overt pronouns, along with a number of similarities. To capture these differences, I have suggested a representational difference. Unlike overt pronouns, which contain the Pers head, and in English also the D head, definite missing objects in these two languages are represented in the same way as indefinite missing objects (that is as <italic>n</italic>), but they are interpreted via the application of the <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>operation. In Polish, which makes extensive use of bare nouns, <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>is freely available and the restrictions on the use of missing objects are related to discourse factors and to the availability of overt pronominals. In English <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>can only apply to complements of verbs which are lexically marked as making this option available. This accounts for the restricted use of such objects in English. On the other hand, the interpretive properties of definite missing objects in Hungarian parallel these of overt pronouns and the restrictions are morphological in nature. More specifically, object drop is blocked in Hungarian when the Num head bearing the plural-number</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>feature does not rise to Pers and has to be realised by the morpheme <italic>-k</italic>, which needs a host to attach to.</p>
<p>On a more general theoretical level, the present analysis of Hungarian provides further support for the hypothesis in Neeleman &#x0026; Szendr&#x0151;i (2007) that the morphology of pronouns has an important role to play in licensing or blocking argument drop. However, one of the crucial hypotheses in Neeleman &#x0026; Szendr&#x0151;i&#x2019;s (2007) analysis of radical <italic>pro </italic>drop is that Spell-Out rules dictating the realisation of pronouns target non-terminal nodes. Contra their approach, the present data can only be explained if Spell-Out rules target terminals. This invites the possibility that Neeleman &#x0026; Szendr&#x0151;i&#x2019;s approach to their domain of empirical inquiry may need to be reconsidered to make a uniform approach to Spell-Out possible.</p>

<title>Interpretive properties of missing objects</title>
</title-group>
</book-part-meta>
<body>
<p>In this chapter, I discuss the interpretation of missing objects, focusing on the ways in which anaphoricity and definiteness of the object can be influenced by the linguistic and extra-linguistic context. I present the basic facts concerning the distribution of non-anaphoric and anaphoric missing objects in English, Polish, and Hungarian, as well as the ways in which these facts have been used to inform the theoretical analyses of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>The discussion begins with general comments on anaphoricity and definite-ness in relation to missing objects in section 4.1. Section 4.2 is concerned with non-anaphoric objects. Here I outline three basic types of analytical approaches</p>
<p>to non-anaphoric missing objects: the approach taking them to involve intransitive structures, that is the lexical ambiguity approach (section 4.2.1), the approach assuming a syntactically transitive structure (section 4.2.2), and the approach equating non-anaphoric missing objects with antipassive structures (section 4.2.3). I conclude that the arguments used to support the first and last view are not without problems and that the second approach is worth pursuing in the absence of strong evidence militating against it. I then offer a brief discussion of two special types of non-anaphoric missing objects, namely objects interpreted as human (section 4.2.4) and objects in structures describing a characteristic property of an instrument (section 4.2.5).</p>
<p>Anaphoric missing objects are the focus of section 4.3. I discuss here the issue of the licensing of definite missing objects by particular verbs in English and, drawing on previous literature, I show that, if licensed, definite missing objects involve transitive structures in English. Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 are concerned with anaphoric missing objects in Polish and in Hungarian respectively. I show here that object drop is not constrained lexically in these languages. The data presented in these sections suggest that definite object drop is largely dependent on pragmatic inferencing in Polish, whereas in Hungarian the number (and person) feature of the object plays the crucial role. I provide a short note about reflexive objects in section 4.4, and follow it in section 4.5 with some more general con-152</p>

<label>4.1</label>
<title>General introduction: anaphoricity and definiteness</title>
<p>As (1) and (2) show respectively, missing objects can be anaphoric or non-anaphoric. Anaphoric missing objects receive their interpretation from a phrase present in the linguistic context or from an entity salient in the extra-linguistic context. They can be indefinite and replaceable with an indefinite nominal, as illustrated in (1a), or definite, as shown in (1b).<sup>1</sup> In the latter case, an anaphoric missing object is interchangeable with a definite nominal expression. Non-anaphoric missing objects can be interpreted with reference to factors such as verb meaning. An alternative to structures with non-anaphoric missing objects in English is the <italic>do some Ving </italic>construction (e.g. <italic>I was doing some reading</italic>; see Allerton 1975).</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>For the purpose of the present discussion, I subsume generic and universal noun phrases under indefinites, in accordance with the view that to be definite, a noun phrase must be referential/specific, as discussed in En&#x00E7; (1991), following Heim (1982).</p>

<p>[Brown] (= Mrs. Coolidge would knit stuff, and the President would sit reading stuff [...]/ Mrs. Coolidge would do some knitting, and the President would sit doing some reading [...].)</p>
<p>As has been noted in the literature on English, whether a verb can be accompanied by an anaphoric or a non-anaphoric missing object is determined lexi-cally.<sup>2</sup> This is suggested by the following examples from Cote (1996:153), where the missing object of the verb <italic>call </italic>has to be identified as an entity salient in discourse, but the same is not true of the missing object of <italic>eat </italic>(see also Allerton</p>
<p>1975).</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>An additional factor relatedto lexical specificationsof verbs which has featured prominently in the literature is the influence of the manner and result components of verb meaning on the availability of object drop. I discuss this issue in detail in section 5.2.2 of chapter 5 and in section 2.3 of chapter 2.</p>

<p>Even though missing objects of verbs such as <italic>eat </italic>do not refer to discourse topics, an entity mentioned explicitly can be included in the meaning of the missing object by way of inferential processes, as indicated by (6) from Ruppenhofer</p>

<p>156</p>
<p>Also the verbs <italic>wash, spray</italic>, and <italic>mop</italic>, likewise typically described in the literature as making only non-anaphoric object drop available, appear in the corpus with anaphoric, definite missing objects, as illustrated in (10), taken from a paragraph describing the process of cleaning a fresco.</p>

A valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower. One man sprayed &#x00F8;, with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting. A second assistant mopped &#x00F8; with two sponges. [Brown]</p>
<p>The missing objects refer to the surface, explicitly mentioned in the second sentence.</p>
<p>In addition to factors related to the antecedent of the object and the lexical properties of the verb, also other phrases in the sentence can be used to guide the interpretation of the missing object.<sup>4</sup> For example, Bobrowski (1981:100)</p>
<p>notes that the subject and its relation to the verb can influence the interpretation</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>I use the term &#x2018;antecedent&#x2019; broadly here to refer to the element whose reference determines the reference of the missing object, be it a linguistic antecedent in the sense of the Binding Theory, or an antecedent present in a larger situational context.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>of the object. Accordingly, in (11)&#x2013;(12), both containing verbs with potentially very broad selectional restrictions (i.e. <italic>wzi&#x0105;&#x0107; </italic>&#x2018;take&#x2019; and <italic>obla&#x0107;</italic>, which translates as <italic>pour/spill (liquid) over, fail, </italic>and <italic>celebrate </italic>out of context), the denotation of the subjects provides information which can help to identify the objects.</p>

<p>As attested by corpus data, the referent of a missing object can also be coextensive with the referent of a missing object of a preceding verb, as shown in (13), or with a different unrealised argument of a preceding verb, as in (14), where the object of the verb <italic>judge </italic>is co-extensive with the implicit argument of the passive structure built around the verb <italic>entertain</italic>. Both of these null arguments are interpreted as anaphoric to <italic>he </italic>in the preceding sentence.</p>

<p>Two tests have been suggested in the literature to determine whether a missing object is definite or indefinite: the test based on the expression of ignorance of the identity of the referent, illustrated here in (15a) and (16a) from Fill-more (1986:96), and the sluicing test, shown in (15b) and (16b) from AnderBois (2012:45). As expected, the definite object is infelicitous in (16), while the indefinite missing object is appropriate in (15a) and can license sluicing, as (15b) shows.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>I begin a more detailed discussion of the interpretive properties of missing objects in the following two sections, which focus on non-anaphoric and anaphoric missing objects respectively.</p>
</sec1>
<sec1>
<label>4.2</label>
<title>Non-anaphoric missing objects</title>
<p>In English, non-anaphoric missing objects are available with verbs such as <italic>clean, cook, drive, examine </italic>(test academically), <italic>hunt, paint, read, sew, bake, draw, iron, mend, plough, recite, sketch, study, teach, vacuum</italic>, and <italic>wash </italic>(see Allerton 1975:215; Levin 1993:33). Similar verbs make available non-anaphoric missing objects in Hungarian (see, e.g., Kiefer 2006; N&#x00E9;meth T. 2008) and in Polish (see, e.g., Karolak 1984). Non-anaphoric missing objects are generally associated with two types of interpretations, both of which can arise with the same verb:</p>
<p>&#x2022; Object general in meaning; verb denoting an activity (see Allerton 1975:217; Fillmore 1986:96; cf. also Cote 1996:148&#x2013;150)</p>
<list id="q_17" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(17)</label><p>When my tongue was paralyzed I couldn&#x2019;t eat &#x00F8; or drink &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>[object understood as any liquid/edible thing]</p>
<list id="q_18" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(18)</label><p>I&#x2019;ve never drunk &#x00F8; out of that (tea)cup. [object understood as any liquid]</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>&#x2022; Semantic specialisation of the object (see Fillmore 1986:96&#x2013;97; see also Williams 2015 for some discussion)</p>
<list id="q_19" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(19)</label><p>We&#x2019;ve already eaten &#x00F8;.	[object understood as a meal]</p>
<list id="q_20" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(20)</label><p>I&#x2019;ve tried to stop drinking &#x00F8;.	[object understood as alcohol]</p>
<p>As (21), adapted from Bobrowski (1981:100&#x2013;102), illustrates, some verbs make non-anaphoric object drop available only when a specialised object is intended. It seems that in cases of this type, general objects are not normally available because the internal argument is not associated with any prototypical entities which could guide the process of interpreting the object.<sup>6</sup></p>
<list id="q_21" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(21)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_21a"><label>a.</label><p>Kierownik bierze &#x00F8;. manager takes &#x2018;The manager takes bribes/drugs.&#x2019;</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Ryby nie bior&#x0105; &#x00F8; w tak&#x0105; pogod&#x0119;. fish not take in this weather &#x2018;Fish don&#x2019;t take bait in such weather.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Similarly, the verb <italic>use </italic>can take a non-anaphoric missing object interpreted as drugs in English (though its counterpart in German cannot; see Ruppenhofer 2004:410):</p>
<p>(i) At 26, Paul has been addicted to crank for years and sent to jail at least twice. By now, he&#x2019;s used &#x00F8; so long he&#x2019;s not quite sure of time anymore. (Sacramento Bee, October 8, 2000, &#x201C;A Madness Called Meth&#x201D;)</p>
<p>For a discussion of the impact of selectional restrictions of the verb on object drop, see Resnik (1993, 1996) and section 5.2.1 in chapter 5.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p>Mittwoch (2005:241) offers some discussion of the variable degrees to which different verbs require specific contextual background to be acceptable with unspecified missing objects, as (22) illustrates. The variants in (22a) are appropriate answers to the question asked, whereas those in (22b) are not.</p>
<list id="q_22" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(22)</label><p>A: What is he doing?</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_a"><label>a.</label><p>B: He is reading &#x00F8;/cooking &#x00F8;/knitting &#x00F8;/drawing &#x00F8;/eating &#x00F8;.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>B: &#x0023;He is polishing &#x00F8;/chopping &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>The importance of contextual information is underscored by the observation that appropriate embedding in context makes unspecified object drop acceptable even with verbs which usually cannot be used without an overt object, such as verbs denoting a change of possession (Mittwoch 2005:243; see also chapter 5):</p>
<list id="q_23" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(23)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_23a"><label>a.</label><p>A: I deal in antiques as a sideline.</p>
<p>B: Have you bought/sold *(anything) recently?</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Last week she sold *(something) to/bought *(something) from a rich Japanese collector.</p>
<p>c.	Did you buy *(anything)? (said to someone coming from a shop)</p>

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_24a"><label>a.</label><p>??Last week John was called to the headmaster because he stole</p>
<p>&#x00F8;. b. Last week John stole &#x00F8; from a teacher.</p>
<p>Non-anaphoric missing objects typically do not introduce a discourse referent which could be referred back to with a pronoun (Williams 2015:103):</p>
<list id="q_25" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(25)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_25a"><label>a.</label><p>Al cooked stuff before it had thawed. b. &#x0023;Al cooked &#x00F8; before it had thawed.</p>
<p>Some literature suggests that there might be exceptions to this (see Ruppenhofer 2004:405), even though the naturalness of the examples can be questioned:</p>
<list id="q_26" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(26)</label><p>I&#x2019;ve eaten &#x00F8; already. It was delicious.</p>
<p>Similarly, even though Farkas &#x0026; de Swart (2003:147) provide the example in (27), where the non-anaphoric object of <italic>&#x00ED;rt </italic>&#x2018;wrote&#x2019; serves as an antecedent to a definite null object of the verb <italic>el-t&#x00E9;pte </italic>&#x2018;tore up&#x2019;, (28b) is not judged as well-formed. A comparison with (28a) suggests that quantificational properties of the</p>
<p>clause can influence the judgments in this case.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p>Finally, as (29)-(30) from Polish show, a non-anaphoric object can sometimes serve as an antecedent to a null subject <italic>(pro), </italic>but this is not always fully acceptable.</p>

<p>[Polish]</p>
<p>Since the possibility of establishing pronominal reference can be influenced by factors such as the salience of the intended referent in the speaker&#x2019;s mind, these patterns could follow from an interplay between semantics and pragmatics.</p>
<p>Polish and Hungarian do not (need to) make a distinction between episodic and habitual contexts at the level of the form of the sentence (as opposed to the distinction between continuous and simple tenses in English). This is why which reading is intended may have to be determined on the basis of other factors. For example, Bobrowski (1981:101) points out that (31) is most readily interpreted as episodic, unless it is known that Marysia is a spinster. The intended interpretation of the object can also influence the interpretation of the sentence in this way, as in (32), which is interpreted as episodic if the object is not understood as alcohol, but which can be either episodic or habitual if the object refers to alcohol.<sup>8</sup></p>

This is illustrated in (i) from an internet search (original spelling preserved).</p>

<p>A similar pattern holds in Hungarian, as (33) from N&#x00E9;meth T. (2000:1674) illustrates. Here the response can be interpreted either habitually (see (33a)) or episodically (see (33b) and (33c)).</p>

<p>Such ambiguity is available with verbs which do not need special licensing conditions to appear with unspecified object drop. I illustrate this in (34) from Polish, where the verb <italic>zabija&#x0107; </italic>&#x2018;kill&#x2019; does not admit the episodic interpretation, as ob-166</p>

<label>4.2.1</label>
<title>Analytical possibilities: lexical ambiguity</title>
<p>The existence of specialised interpretations, illustrated in (19)&#x2013;(21) above, has been used to argue that the verbs which take non-anaphoric missing objects should be treated as separate, intransitive entries in the lexicon. On this approach, for example, the transitive <italic>drink </italic>is used in contexts with an overt object and the intransitive <italic>drink </italic>is used otherwise. Analyses treating structures with non-anaphoric missing objects as syntactically intransitive have been proposed, among others, in Bresnan (1978), Fodor &#x0026; Fodor (1980), and Jackendoff (1990).<sup>9</sup> On this ap-</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Bresnan (1978) supplements the analysis with lexical mapping rules to derive the fact that an event of eating is always an event of eating something. Fodor &#x0026; Fodor (1980) argue for deriving the facts with meaning postulates rather than lexical mapping rules, but see Gillon (2012) for a critique. Considering variation between <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>devour</italic>, Jackendoff (1990) proposes to encode optionality of the object with the former, but not the latter, by introducing brackets into the representation of the relevant verbs. For example, the Thing argument is optional with <italic>eat</italic>.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>proach, the meaning of the intransitive <italic>drink </italic>can be more specific, with additional conditions stated over the patient/theme participant of the event, making the interpretation of the intransitive entry similar in its denotation to the phrase <italic>drink alcohol </italic>(see, e.g., Lasnik 2000; Williams 2015).</p>
<p>The fact that, for example, the verb <italic>eat </italic>can be used with non-food-denoting objects when the object is overt, as (35) from Lehrer (1970:230) shows, whereas a null object can only be interpreted as food, has been used to support the approach to non-anaphoric missing objects as lexically encoded. However, examples such as (36) suggest that this might not be a strong argument.</p>
<list id="q_35" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(35)</label><p>John won a bet by eating some iron nails and wooden pegs.</p>
<list id="q_36" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(36)</label><p>Did you run this morning?</p>
<p>The verb <italic>run </italic>in isolation is very general in meaning, denoting a particular manner of movement. However, interpretation in the context in which (36) could be uttered is not general, but rather relates to running as a type of exercise, with all of its relevant connotations (special outfit, pre-determined time and/or distance, etc.). Introducing a separate lexical entry with a denotation of <italic>running for sport</italic>, and, for the sake of consistency, doing the same for any other verb which might trigger specialised reading in some contexts does not seem motivated well</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>enough. The effect of specialised interpretation seems to be general enough to warrant a (pragmatic) inference-based account. Admittedly, comparing (36) and cases of specialised missing objects is a matter of subtle judgments, but if indeed these contexts are parallel, they show that postulating homonymy is not necessary to account for the specialised readings, which are rather a result of broader effects of conventionalisation of certain types of activities.</p>
<p>In addition, postulating intransitive entries with special conditions on the interpretation of the patient/theme raises questions about the derivation of cases such as (17)&#x2014;(18) above, where the object is interpreted as general in meaning. If the meaning of the intransitive <italic>drink </italic>is that of the phrase <italic>drink alcohol</italic>, the meaning of non-anaphoric missing objects should be restricted to alcohol, unless a further intransitive entry <italic>drink </italic>is postulated, this time similar in meaning to <italic>drink liquid</italic>.<sup>10</sup> In addition to multiplying lexical entries, such an approach seems</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>The corpus examples with <italic>write </italic>in (i), where the non-anaphoric missing objects refer to poetry/prose, letters, any text, or are used in a sentence concerning a general ability to write, show that the verbs <italic>drink </italic>and <italic>eat </italic>are not isolated cases where the missing objects can have different meanings.</p>
<p>(i) a. But both were high-spirited and vivacious, both had tempers to control, both loved languages, especially English and German, both were good teachers and wrote &#x00F8; for publication.	[Brown]</p>

<p>d.	When her right hand was incapacitated by the rheumatism, Sadie learned to write &#x00F8; with her left hand.	[Brown]</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>inconsistent with what is observed with uncontroversial cases of ambiguity. As Gillon (2012:319) notes, one of the properties of ambiguous items is that all of their interpretations are always available. Accordingly, the expression /bil dajd/ can be understood either as the acceptable sentence <italic>Bill died </italic>or as the unacceptable sentence <italic>*Bill dyed &#x00F8;. </italic>On the other hand, /bil red/ can only be interpreted as an acceptable sentence and cannot be interpreted as an unacceptable instance of object drop with a transitive verb <italic>read.</italic></p>
<p>What is more, in some special types of contexts even verbs such as <italic>kill, </italic>which are not associated with non-anaphoric object drop in the same way as <italic>drink </italic>is, can appear with missing objects (e.g. <italic>I&#x2019;ve never killed&#x00F8; before; </italic>see chapter 5 for more discussion). This means that some account of structures with missing objects is still needed for such cases. Postulating an intransitive entry for all verbs and imposing additional restrictions on the distribution of the intransitive variant seems less desirable theoretically than postulating a smaller lexicon and developing a theory of the conditions under which transitive verbs can appear with missing objects. Therefore, the more parsimonious solution seems to be to take the specialised readings associated with verbs such as <italic>run, drink, </italic>and <italic>eat </italic>to arise through the application of pragmatic and world knowledge in the process of interpretation, without this being encoded directly via multiplying lexical entries. <sup>11</sup></p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The analytical contribution of this work focuses on the syntactic aspect of missing objects (see part 1) and I do not offer an explicit model of interpretation of the object within pragmatic</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>This approach makes it possible to consider the problem of deriving all data with object drop with a uniform analysis in mind, such as the one put forward in part 1 of this book.</p>
</sec2>

<label>4.2.2</label>
<title>Analytical possibilities: syntactic transitivity</title>
<p>Within syntactic approaches, Fraser &#x0026; Ross (1970) propose the Rule of Unspecified NP Deletion in their early generative account. Furthermore, Fillmore (1986) quotes Katz &#x0026; Postal (1964), who propose that the object position is occupied by <italic>something </italic>or <italic>it</italic>, which can be deleted. Solutions of this type ensure that the object is available at deep structure and can satisfy the selectional requirements of the verb and be interpreted. Structures with missing objects are thus treated as both syntactically and semantically transitive. However, Fillmore (1986:106) notices that, even though the missing object usually seems to be semantically equivalent to the word <italic>something</italic>, this is not always the case. For example, in</p>
<list id="q_37" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(37)</label><p>the object is interpreted as <italic>stuff </italic>rather than as <italic>something</italic>.</p>
<p>context. However, some studies conducted within the framework of Relevance Theory discuss this issue (Groefsema 1995; N&#x00E9;meth T. 2000; Scott 2006). For example, Scott (2006) suggests that when syntactic rules do not block omission, a complement can be omitted in accordance with optimal relevance (Sperber &#x0026; Wilson 1986:207, quoted here after Scott 2006:159):</p>
<p>(i) <italic>Presumption of optimal relevance</italic></p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_a"><label>a.</label><p>The ostensive stimulus is relevant enough for it to be worth the addressee&#x2019;s effort to process it.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>The ostensive stimulus is the most relevant one compatible with the communi cator&#x2019;s abilities and preferences.</p>
<p>171</p>
<list id="q_37" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(37)</label><p>I spent three days cooking &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>Importantly, indefinite missing objects do not parallel the quantifier <italic>something </italic>or indefinite noun phrases in scopal properties (see Bresnan 1978; Fodor &#x0026; Fodor 1980; Condoravdi &#x0026; Gawron 1996; Williams 2015). As noted in chapter 1 of part 1, indefinite missing objects are restricted to narrow-scope readings. In this they differ from the quantifier <italic>something </italic>and indefinite noun phrases, which can sometimes take wide scope with respect to quantifiers merged higher in the structure (see (38) from Fodor &#x0026; Fodor 1980:759 and in (39) from Williams 2015:105).</p>
<list id="q_38" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(38)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_38a"><label>a.</label><p>Everybody ate something. b. Everybody ate &#x00F8;.</p>
<list id="q_39" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(39)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_39a"><label>a.</label><p>Every boy stole a book from exactly three girls. b. Exactly three students baked &#x00F8; this morning.</p>
<p>In (38), only the (a) example allows the wide-scope reading of <italic>something</italic>, while (38b) does not entail that there was some specific thing x such that everyone ate x. Similarly, (39a) has the interpretation on which the indefinite <italic>exactly three girls </italic>scopes over the quantifier <italic>every boy</italic>, but (39b) cannot be interpreted to mean that</p>
<p>172</p>

<p>Even though the scopal facts have been used to support the intransitive approach to the structure with missing objects (see esp. Bresnan 1978; Fodor &#x0026; Fodor 1980) the fact that also bare plurals in English can only take narrow scope (Carlson 1977:15-21) suggests a different analytical possibility.</p>

<p>The interpretive parallelism between bare plurals, mass nouns, and missing objects opens up the possibility that missing object structures are transitive, with the mechanism responsible for the restriction on the scopal interpretation of the object being the same in all three cases (see chapter 2 in part 1 for a discussion of one possibility).</p>
<p>Analyses which assume the projection of the object position in syntax and which do not run into the problems of scope with the deletion of an indefinite quantifier have also been put forward in the literature. For example, in his analysis of structures with non-anaphoric missing objects in Polish, Bobrowski (1981, 1985) introduces into the lexicon nominal elements symbolised as &#x2206; (see also Bobrowski 1994). These elements are characterised as general in meaning and are treated on a par with lexical nouns for the purpose of rewrite rules, as exemplified in (44).</p>
<list id="q_44" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(44)</label><p>N <italic>&#x2192; </italic>{ksi&#x0105;&#x017C;ka, &#x2206;[+nale&#x017C;&#x0105;ce do literatury]} &#x2018;N <italic>&#x2192; </italic>{book, &#x2206;[+belonging to literature]}&#x2019;</p>
<p>The node &#x2206; undergoes an obligatory deletion transformation. This approach makes it possible to treat verbs such as <italic>czyta&#x0107; </italic>&#x2018;read&#x2019; as uniformly transitive, even</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>though it also suffers from the disadvantage of expanding the lexicon, populating it with as many items &#x2206; as needed to capture all the meanings of specialised and general non-anaphoric missing objects.</p>
<p>Within the GB framework approaches employing deletion rules had their successors in analyses employing lexically null elements. The seminal discussion in Rizzi (1986) identifies syntactically active null objects in Italian as <italic>pro </italic>(see section 4.2.4 for some more comments on Rizzi&#x2019;s work). Hoekstra &#x0026; Roberts (1993) develop Rizzi&#x2019;s approach further to capture also some English facts, employing <italic>pro </italic>to ensure the satisfaction of the Projection Principle. Even though their focus is on the middle formation, illustrated in (45), with the logical subject in middles analysed as a quasi-universal arbitrary <italic>pro</italic>, they suggest that the object position of verbs such as <italic>rape, murder, kill</italic>, and <italic>steal </italic>is also occupied by a quasi-universal arbitrary <italic>pro </italic>when they are used in the structure with object drop, as shown in (46).<sup>13</sup> This <italic>pro </italic>is in fact a null counterpart of the overt impersonal <italic>one</italic>. The sentences in (45)&#x2013;(46), from Hoekstra &#x0026; Roberts (1993:187&#x2013;189), illustrate interpretive similarities shared by the three relevant constructions (i.e. middles, <italic>one </italic>impersonals, and sentences with arbitrary missing objects).</p>
<p><sup>13</sup>The distinction between quasi-universal and quasi-existential arbitrary elements has been proposed in Cinque (1988), with the former ones being characterised, among others, by the compatibility with generic, but not specific, time reference.</p>

<p>Building on Rizzi&#x2019;s (1986) theory of licensing and identification of <italic>pro</italic>, Hoekstra &#x0026; Roberts suggest that <italic>pro </italic>can be content-licensed in two ways, morphologically, as argued for in Rizzi (1986), and thematically. The latter content-licensing condition is referred to as <italic>arb </italic>licensing and requires <italic>p ro </italic>to be the sister of a lexical head assigning it the theta role and the index <italic>arb</italic>.</p>
<p>Keyser &#x0026; Roeper (1992) suggest that all verbs in English are associated with what they refer to as an abstract &#x2018;<italic>Clitic </italic>position&#x2019;, a sister to V. This position is</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>occupied by an &#x2018;invisible nominal&#x2019; in structures with missing objects such as (48) from Keyser&#x0026; Roeper (1992:96).</p>
<list id="q_48" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(48)</label><p>

<list-item id="q_48a"><label>a.</label><p>Don&#x2019;t push &#x00F8;. b. Don&#x2019;t kick &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>However, some differences in the syntactic behaviour of null and overt ob-jects create a challenge for accounts that postulate a syntactically projected object position in structures with missing objects (in English). Firstly, the null object cannot be promoted to the subject position in a passivised variant of the sentence:</p>
<list id="q_49" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(49)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_49a"><label>a.</label><p>Wendy drinks &#x00F8;.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>*&#x00F8; is drunk by Wendy.</p>
<p>Chomsky (1957:64) suggests that the passive transformation can be used to reject the analysis of intransitive verbs as taking zero objects. In particular, since a string such as <italic>John slept&#x2014;&#x00F8; </italic>meets the structural description of the passive transformation, <italic>&#x00F8;&#x2014;was slept-by John </italic>should be a possible sentence of English.<sup>14</sup> However, within the current approach to grammar, it is not completely clear whether the effect in (49) is directly related to the syntactic status of the</p>

<p><italic>1</italic>77</p>
<p>object and that it may indicate the absence of the object in the syntactic representation, or whether it can be attributed to the interaction of the requirements of operations involved in the passive formation and some properties of the element in the object position. I suggest one possibility exploring this option in chapter 2 of part 1.</p>
<p>Secondly, as noted, among others, inRuppenhofer (2004:406&#x2013;407), secondary predication with depictives, shown in (50), and resultatives, illustrated in (51), predicated of the indefinite missing object is usually impossible.</p>

<p>Phrases such as <italic>out of that (tea)cup </italic>in (18), repeated here in (53), have been analysed as secondary predicates.</p>
<list id="q_53" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(53)</label><p>I&#x2019;ve never drunk &#x00F8; out of that (tea)cup.</p>
<p>Goldberg (2005) takes data of the type in (53) to feature a resultative structure interpreted as involving a path of motion predicated of the unrealised argument (see also section 5.2.2 in chapter 5). However, a plausible alternative could be to take the relevant phrases to modify the event rather than the object. If this is correct, these phrases introduce the directionality of the action or an instrument, rather than the direction of movement predicated directly of the object. This possibility is supported by a telicity-related contrast between sentences such as (53) and sentences which uncontroversially contain resultative predicates. In particular, sentences involving phrases analysed as a path of motion predicated of the missing object by Goldberg (2005) are construed as atelic, as (54) shows, whereas resultatives typically trigger telic interpretation, as (55) from Wechsler (2015:290) illustrates.<sup>15</sup></p>

<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>John hammered the metal flat (*for an hour/in an hour).</p>
<p>The sentences in (54) and (55b) also differ in their interpretation. The sentence in (55b) is similar in meaning to <italic>John hammered the metal, causing the metal to become flat </italic>or to <italic>As John hammered the metal, the metal became flatter and flatter, until it was flat </italic>(Wechsler 2015). By contrast, (54) cannot be interpreted in the same way as <italic>John drank liquid, causing the liquid to be out of that (tea)cup </italic>or as <italic>As John drank liquid, more and more liquid was out of that (tea)cup, until it was (all) out of that (tea)cup</italic>. Even though the same situation can fulfil truth conditions for all of these sentences, the element of causation relating John&#x2019;s intention and the state of affairs in which the liquid is out of the (tea)cup seems absent in (54), but present in the resultative paraphrases. The sentence in (54) can be true when there is still some liquid left in the cup at the end of the drinking event, but at the end of the hammering event in (55b), the entire piece of metal is flat. This suggests that (53) does not constitute a case of resultative predication involving the missing object. The example in (53) thus does not constitute convincing evidence for the availability of unspecified missing objects in structures with secondary predication.</p>
<p>A more convincing case is put forward in Mittwoch (2005:253), who reports</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>that missing objects can participate in secondary predication in cases such as (56), where the property of being high is attributed to buildings.</p>
<list id="q_56" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(56)</label><p>These architects build &#x00F8; high.</p>
<p>Mittwoch (2005) interprets this as indicating that even in English unspecified missing objects can be projected in the syntax. In this case, event modification does not seem plausible. Similarly, the adverb <italic>wysoko </italic>&#x2018;high&#x2019; in (57) from Polish does not locate the event of building (at a high position) in space, but attributes a property to the referent of the implicit object (which becomes high in the event).</p>

<p>full-time farmers because they buy &#x00F8; in smaller quantities. [Brown]</p>
<p>Furthermore, corpus data include some examples of sentences with missing objects of phrasal verbs, as exemplified in (60), where object drop is licensed by modality introduced by the phrase <italic>know how</italic>.<sup>16</sup> Also in (61) the presence of the particle <italic>up </italic>in the phrase <italic>pry up </italic>does not block object drop licensed by the verb sequence.</p>

<p>The above discussion indicates that passive formation and secondary predication are distinguished by their sensitivity to missing objects, suggesting that their acceptability is determined by different properties of the objects. This is thus another fact which syntactic analyses need to address, in addition to explaining why a difference between missing objects and overt ones should be found at all</p>
<p>on the assumption that they are all projected in syntax.</p>

<label>4.2.3</label>
<title>Analytical possibilities: antipassive</title>
<p>Another analytical option is briefly mentioned in Croft (2012), who suggests that unspecified missing objects, which he refers to as indefinite null instantiations, could be analysed as involving a morphologically-unmarked antipassive structure. He attributes the lack of overt antipassive marking to a general property of English, namely the lack of overt markers of verbal alternations (cf. <italic>She broke a branch </italic>and <italic>A branch broke). </italic>However, this hypothesis seems incompatible with some data from Polish. In particular, Polish has the morpheme <italic>si&#x0119;, </italic>which signalises various types of alternations (e.g. anticausative, as in <italic>Z&#x0142;ama&#x0142;a ga&#x0142;&#x0105;&#x017A; </italic>&#x2018;She broke a branch&#x2019; vs. <italic>Ga&#x0142;&#x0105;&#x017A; si&#x0119; z&#x0142;ama&#x0142;a </italic>&#x2018;A branch broke&#x2019;). There is indeed one construction with missing objects which involves this morpheme, shown in (62). However, the morpheme is absent in the regular structures with unspecified object drop, as evidenced by examples throughout this work.</p>
<list id="q_62" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(62)</label><p>Ta dziewczynkasi&#x0119;przezywa.</p>
<p>this little.girl <sc><bold>se </bold></sc>call.names-3sG</p>
<p>&#x2018;This little girl calls/is calling people/me/us names.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>The object in the construction in (62) can only be interpreted as human, suggesting perhaps that <italic>si&#x0119; </italic>is the realisation of a head in the extended verbal projection and, as a part of an antipassive structure, restricts the interpretation of the inter-</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>nal theta role of a verb to human individuals. I do not analyse this structure in detail here, as the presence of the morpheme <italic>si&#x0119; </italic>introduces additional complications which go beyond the scope of this study (see, e.g., Rivero 2000; Rivero &#x0026; Milojevi&#x0107; Sheppard 2003 for an analysis). What is important for the present discussion is that if (62) is an instance of an antipassive structure in Polish, unspecified object drop of the type which I discuss in this section cannot be given the same treatment.<sup>17</sup> Just like in English, structures with unspecified missing objects are morphologically unmarked in Polish, a language which has the requisite morphological marker in its inventory. I thus do not pursue an antipassive analysis of non-anaphoric object drop here.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2>
<label>4.2.4</label>
<title>A special case: human object</title>
<p>In addition to indefinite missing objects of verbs such as <italic>read</italic>, there is a set of verbs whose missing objects are typically interpreted as referring to people in general (see Rizzi 1986; Levin 1993), as illustrated in (63) and (64).</p>
<list id="q_63" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(63)</label><p>This leads &#x00F8; to the following conclusion.</p>
<list id="q_64" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(64)</label><p>That dog bites &#x00F8;.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup>For some discussion of antipassives in Polish, see Janic (2011).</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>Levin (1993) refers to the construction in (64) as the &#x2018;characteristic property of agent alternation&#x2019;, henceforth CPAA. CPAA is usually found with verbs such as <italic>bite, butt, itch, kick, pinch, prick, scratch</italic>, and <italic>sting </italic>and it serves the purpose of predicating a property of the subject, so that the referent of the subject (agent) is taken to show a propensity for the action named by the verb.</p>
<p>However, even though Levin (1993) describes CPAA as involving exclusively human themes, the object in fact need not be human, as shown in (65).<sup>18</sup></p>
<list id="q_65" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(65)</label><p>[<italic>Context: </italic>a documentary about a bear cub with the narrator describing the cub&#x2019;s encounter with a snake] If it comes closer to the snake, it will learn that the snake bites &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>In (65), the property of being a biter is predicated of the snake, but the theme is</p>
<p>not necessarily interpreted as human. This suggests that, just like in other cases</p>
<p>of non-anaphoric missing objects discussed above, the interpretation of objects</p>
<p>in CPAA is subject to some guidance from the meaning of the entire sentence</p>
<p>and context, rather than being rigidly set as human-denoting. This contrasts</p>
<p>with some accounts of similar structures proposed within the line of research</p>
<p>taking the patient/theme theta role to be saturated in the lexicon, such as Rizzi <sup>18</sup>I would like to thank Joseph DeVeaugh-Geiss for the judgment of (65) and (68).</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>(1986) and Marelj (2004). A lexically saturated argument is stipulated to be interpreted as human in all its occurrences. For example, to derive structures with non-anaphoric missing objects of the type in (63), Rizzi (1986:509) suggests the following lexical rule, where <italic>arb </italic>is associated with properties such as [+human], [generic], etc.:</p>
<list id="q_66" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(66)</label><p>Assign <italic>arb </italic>to the direct 6-role.</p>
<p>A similar interpretive effect is achieved in Marelj (2004), who assumes the creation of the ARB-role (a theta role (cluster) for which there are no merging instructions within Reinhart&#x2019;s Theta System (see, e.g., Reinhart 2002)) by a lexical operation of ARB-saturation (variable binding) at LF. This solution has the same interpretive effect as Rizzi&#x2019;s rule in (66). Importantly, on these accounts, arbitrary interpretation is inherently related to the feature [+human]. This is a problem in the light of examples such as (65) above.</p>
<p>Importantly, even though Rizzi (1986) discusses the relation between lexical saturation and the interpretation of an argument as [+human] with respect to examples other than CPAA, as (67) illustrates, the type of contexts with missing objects which he investigates does not enforce the human reading either, as (68) indicates.</p>

<p>A sharp whistle cautions &#x00F8; against danger.</p>
<p>In the light of data such as (65) and (68), I assume that the human interpretation usually observed with CPAA (and related constructions) is an effect arising at the Conceptual-Intentional (C-I) interface rather than an inherent property of the construction.</p>
<p>As far as syntax is concerned, structures such as (67) demonstrate an interesting cross-linguistic contrast: languages differ in whether the understood object can participate in control. Providing the English examples in (69), modelled on Rizzi&#x2019;s (1986:503) examples, Authier (1989:46) points out that a similar contrast between structures with null and overt objects does not hold in French, as (70) shows.

<p>The French data pattern with what Rizzi (1986) observes for Italian. Both Rizzi and Authier assume that the generalisation in (71) holds universally and interpret the difference between Italian and French on the one hand and English on the other in terms of the presence versus absence of an object in the syntactic representation. Authier (1989) follows Rizzi (1986) in taking this difference to result from the availability of null categories in positions governed by the verb in Italian and French, but not in English. For Rizzi the null category is <italic>pro </italic>and for Authier it is a free variable, available only if it can be bound by an (overt or covert) adverb of quantification via the mechanism of unselective binding proposed in Lewis (1975). Unselective binding accounts for the possibility of interpreting (72a) as (72b), where adverbs of quantification are treated as operators which bind all free variables in a sentence (Authier 1989:54).</p>

<list-item><label>(72)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_72a"><label>a.</label><p>Cats sometimes like to swim. b. Some cats like to swim.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>A similar effect arises with arbitrary missing objects in French, as shown in (73a), which can be paraphrased with (73b), as discussed in Authier (1989:55).</p>
<list id="q_73" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(73)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_73a"><label>a.</label><p>Souvent, la peur pousse &#x00F8; &#x00E0; PRO fuir. &#x2018;Often, fear pushes <italic>arb </italic>to flee.&#x2019; b. La peur pousse beaucoup de gens &#x00E0; PRO fuir.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Fear pushes a lot of people to flee.&#x2019;	[French]</p>
<p>However, the limited number of examples in Authier (1989) may conceal the full spectrum of the interpretive options for the object. The Polish sentence in (74a), parallel to (73a), has the same truth conditions as <italic>Fear pushes a lot of people to make risky decisions</italic>, but a different interpretation, on which the adverb quantifies only over events and the object is interpreted as generic seems also to be available. This ambiguity is easier to detect with a context which does not favour the former type of interpretation as much as (74a). The sentence in (74b) seems ambiguous without favouring a particular reading (the adverb can quantify over the object or the subject (<italic>Loans push a lot of people to make risky decisions </italic>versus <italic>A lot of loans push people (in general)/those who took them to make risky decisions</italic>) or only over the event variable). On the other hand, the most salient interpretation of (74c) seems to be the one on which the</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>adverb quantifies over the subject (i.e. <italic>A lot of brokers urge people to make risky decisions</italic>). This shows that the variable associated with the internal argument can be bound by a quantificational adverb, but this binding is not obligatory.</p>

<title>A special case: characteristic property of the instrument</title>
<p>Another relevant construction distinguished in Levin (1993:39) is the &#x2018;characteristic property of instrument alternation&#x2019;, involving verbs such as <italic>clip, cook, cut, slice, </italic>and <italic>write</italic>. This construction is used to indicate whether an instrument is suitable to carry out the action denoted by the verb:<sup>19</sup></p>
<p><sup>19</sup>See Potashnik (2012) for some discussion of the conditions under which an instrument can be merged as the subject and the general approach to the derivation of this pattern within the</p>

<p>This alternation is similar to CPAA discussed in the previous section in that it also involves predicating a property of the subject.</p>
<p>Discussing a larger class of constructions with instrument subjects, which includes structures with realised direct objects, Fellbaum &#x0026; Rapoport (2013:47) point to the importance of informativeness for the well-formedness of sentences characterising the subject.

<title>Anaphoric missing objects</title>
<p>Missing objects are anaphoric when their meaning is reconstructed on the basis of previous linguistic context, as (79)&#x2013;(80) from Allerton (1975:214, 220) illustrate, or when the content of the object is retrieved from situational context, as in (81)&#x2013; (82) from Ruppenhofer &#x0026; Michaelis (2013:4).</p>
<list id="q_79" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(79)</label><p>I went to see the cricket. George was watching &#x00F8; already.</p>

<list id="q_82" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(82)</label><p>Give me (that)!</p>
<p>In addition to being definite, as in the examples above, an anaphoric object can also be indefinite, as in (83), where the meaning of the missing object can be identified as human beings based on the preceding context.</p>
<list id="q_83" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(83)</label><p>It is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack &#x00F8;.	[Brown]</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>Liu (2008:306&#x2013;307) suggests the following division into five semantic classes of verbs which make definite object drop available:</p>
<p>&#x2022;	Epistemic/cognitive, e.g., <italic>forget, know, realise, recall</italic>; a <italic>that/wh-</italic>clause or the pronouns <italic>it/that </italic>are missing:</p>

<p>&#x2022;	Inquisitorial/explanatory, e.g., <italic>ask, explain, find out</italic>; a <italic>whether/how</italic>-clause or the pronouns <italic>it/that </italic>are missing:</p>
<list id="q_85" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>&#x2022;	Sensory, e.g., <italic>hear, notice</italic>; a clause/noun/noun+infinitive complement is missing:</p>
<list id="q_86" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(86)</label><p>The writing was on the wall but nobody noticed &#x00F8;.	[BNC]</p>
<p>&#x2022;	Aspectual, e.g., <italic>continue, resume, stop</italic>; a noun (often gerund)/infinitive is missing:</p>
<list id="q_87" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(87)</label><p>I called her a little angel, but she got upset about that, so I stopped &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>[BNC]</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>&#x2022; Action/performative, e.g., <italic>accept, consider, decline</italic>; a noun (often con-crete)/<italic>that</italic>-clause/infinitive is missing:</p>
<list id="q_88" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(88)</label><p>He offered me a cigarette. I declined &#x00F8;.	[BNC]</p>
<p>As noticed in Garc&#x00ED;a Velasco &#x0026; Portero Mu&#x00F1;oz (2002), the first four types of verbs distinguished above, which they refer to as speech act/cognition verbs, perceptual verbs, and aspectual verbs respectively, typically select objects which denote non-first order entities.<sup>20</sup> Accordingly, the object omitted in (87) is a second-order entity, in (84) and (86) a third-order entity, and in (85) a fourth-order entity.<sup>21</sup> However, as indicated by examples such as (88) and (79)&#x2013;(82), in an appropriate linguistic and/or situational context, objects denoting first-order</p>
<p><sup>20</sup>See Lyons (1977), who introduces the notion of first-order entities (i.e. objects located in time and space, evaluated in terms of their existence), second-order entities (i.e. events, states of affairs, located in time, evaluated in terms of their reality), and third-order entities (i.e. propositions, evaluated in terms of their truth) and Hengeveld (1992), who complements this classification with fourth-order entities (i.e. speech acts, evaluated in terms of their felicity).</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>The sole fact that a verb subcategorises for a complement denoting a non-first-order entity is not enough to license the non-realisation of the complement, as indicated by verbs such as <italic>figure out </italic>and <italic>discover</italic>, which do not behave in parallel with <italic>find out </italic>and <italic>know </italic>and do not make object drop possible (Grimshaw 1979). To capture this fact, Grimshaw (1979) suggests that the subcategorisation frames of the latter verbs, but not the former ones, specify that they take the S&#x2019; complement optionally. This means that for Grimshaw (1979) the unrealised complement is absent from syntactic derivation in this context. She further assumes a rule of copying the semantic structure/relevant part of the logical representation from the antecedent into the elliptical structure. Sentences such as (i) can provide an argument for assuming that it is the semantic representation of the antecedent and not its syntactic structure that matters. The possible antecedent <italic>the time </italic>is not subcategorised by the verb <italic>inquire </italic>(*<italic>inquire the time</italic>; Grimshaw 1979:308).</p>
<p>(i) Bill asked me the time, so I inquired &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>entities can also be dropped in English (see also Garc&#x00ED;a Velasco &#x0026; Portero Mu&#x00F1;oz 2002).<sup>22</sup> It is this type of missing objects that is the focus of this work. For discussions of null complement anaphora with verbs such as <italic>notice</italic>, see, for example, Depiante (2000); Williams (2012) and the references cited therein.</p>
<p>Lexical variation, the property probably most often noticed in relation to the conditions on object drop in English, distinguishes between lexical items belonging to the same verb classes, including verbs of caring for a specific body part. Here, the verbs <italic>brush (teeth), floss (teeth), shave (beard, legs), </italic>and <italic>wash (hands, face) </italic>allow object drop, while the verbs <italic>bob (hair), brush (hair), file (nails), </italic>and <italic>towel (face, hands) </italic>require the presence of an overt object (Levin 1993:34):</p>

<list-item id="q_89a"><label>a.</label><p>I flossed my teeth.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>I flossed &#x00F8;.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup>As shown in Depiante (2000:60), a verb which makes it possible for its propositional complement to be dropped need not tolerate the omission of its individual-denoting complement:</p>
<p>(i) a. The children know [<SUB>NP</SUB> the song].</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>The children know [<SUB>CP</SUB> that it is time to leave].</p>
<p>(ii) a. The teacher told the children that it was time to leave even though they already knew &#x00F8;. b. *The children learned the song on Monday but by Friday they no longer knew &#x00F8;.</p>

<p>Differences are found not only across different lexical items, but also across different senses expressed by the same item (Fillmore 1986:101):</p>

<p>c.	They approached the solution./*They approached &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>Groefsema (1995) notes in relation to examples such as (92) that it is generally the case that when a verb can express spatial and non-spatial movement, the argument can be dropped only in the former context, as the assumptions about where the referent of the external argument is going are immediately accessible only in the former case. Similarly, Groefsema (1995:157) shows that with the verb <italic>follow</italic>, omission of the object is degraded when the object is not understood as path, but, for example, denotes a lecture:</p>
<list id="q_93" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(93)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_93a"><label>a.</label><p>?John went to the lecture on astronomy, but he couldn&#x2019;t follow &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>196</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>John went to the lecture on astronomy, but he couldn&#x2019;t follow it.</p>
<p>According to Groefsema (1995) the conceptual structure of <italic>follow </italic>(in the sense of Jackendoff 1990) contains information specifying that a following event involves an instance of a thing that has gone somewhere before you. This is why a lecture can be conceptualised as going along a path and the judgments of (92) differ depending on people&#x2019;s experience with lectures and their knowledge about how lectures are structured. In addition to the locational sense, missing objects with the verb <italic>follow </italic>appear in the corpus also in the temporal sense, as shown in (94), and in the metaphorical context of providing support to a leader, as in (95).</p>
<list id="q_94" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(94)</label><p>The deeds of this team, through two seasons and in the two World&#x2019;s Series that followed &#x00F8;, have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said.	[Brown]</p>

<p>The sentence in (96) provides a similar example, illustrating that also the verb <italic>push </italic>makes object drop possible when used in its more abstract sense.</p>
<p>197</p>
<list id="q_96" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(96)</label><p>Adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push &#x00F8;.	[Brown]</p>
<p>Furthermore, an anaphoric object lacking an antecedent in the surrounding linguistic environment does not have to have a referent salient in the extra-linguistic context, but can also be abstract, as shown in (97), where the object refers to the burglary, and in (98), where the object of <italic>accepted </italic>is the invitation.</p>

<p>I answered &#x00F8; to find Nadine at the other end.	[Brown]</p>
<p>Fillmore (1986) notes further that no cases of change-of-state verbs (e.g. <italic>break, bend, create, destroy, move, lift</italic>) are found with definite object drop. For non-affected objects to be dropped (e.g. the object of <italic>call</italic>), a salient discourse antecedent is required. Hence, an entity just introduced into the discourse is not appropriate as an antecedent (Cote 1996:154&#x2013;155):</p>
<list id="q_100" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(100)</label><p>A: Did you speak to a customer service office? B: &#x0023;I called &#x00F8; but got no answer.</p>

<list-item><label>(101)</label><p>A: Did you speak to the customer service office? B: I called &#x00F8; but got no answer.</p>
<p>With verbs of the <italic>call </italic>type, the interpretation of the object depends on discourse factors, as shown in (102)&#x2013;(104), where the object refers to the speaker in the former case, but to the hearer and the non-participant in the latter cases (Cote</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>1996:155&#x2013;156).</p>

<p>The fact that in cases of verbs such as <italic>call </italic>and <italic>visit </italic>bound variable reading is available (see (107)) implies that these verbs are at least semantically transitive, and that the internal argument position is occupied by a variable available to be bound. This condition is necessary for variable binding to arise (see also Williams 2015 for some discussion; see (155) in section 4.5 for similar data with the verb <italic>win</italic>).<sup>23</sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, whatever element introduces this variable, it does not behave exactly the same as either pronouns or R-expressions with respect to Binding Theory. For example, as noted in chapter 1 of part 1, definite missing objects</p>
<p>seem to differ from pronouns with respect to the Principle B effect and with re-<sup>23</sup>On the other hand, indefinite missing objects do not have bound variable readings (Williams 2015:114):</p>
<p>(i) a. No cake was praised by the student who baked it. b. No cake was praised by the student who baked &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>This need not mean that objects of this type are not represented structurally, but points to a semantic difference between definite and indefinite missing objects, whereby the latter are not of the right type to participate in relations such as variable binding (cf. (155) in the main text, showing that bound variable readings are available for pronouns and definite noun phrases).</p>

<p>The greater flexibility of missing objects in comparison with pronouns as far as the interpretive mechanisms are concerned has also been observed for sentences with the verb <italic>win</italic>. Even though the overt pronominal object has to be interpreted with reference to a salient entity, however inadequate, a missing object invites some effort on the part of the addressee to arrive at a suitable interpretation (see</p>
<p>203</p>
<list id="q_114" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(114)</label><p>from Williams 2012:137, where (114a) is likely to trigger a response such as (114b), but where (114c) is more likely to be followed by (114d)).</p>

<p>c.	I went to the faculty meeting and won &#x00F8;.</p>

<p>Just as is usually the case with non-anaphoric objects, exemplified in (50)&#x2013; (51) in section 4.2, predicating a depictive predicate of definite missing objects is unacceptable in English (Ruppenhofer 2004:406):</p>
<list id="q_115" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(115)</label><p>*We attacked &#x00F8; in their homes.</p>
<p>What the English data overviewed above seem to suggest is that, if the missing object is hypothesised to be projected syntactically, the internal structure of its projection is not exactly the same as the internal structure of pronouns and definite lexical arguments, which can lead to the interpretive and syntactic differences between overt and null objects.</p>
<p>Since anaphoric, and especially definite, missing objects in Polish and Hungarian are associated with some additional variable facts, I discuss them sepa-204</p>
<p>rately in the two following sections.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2>
<label>4.3.1</label>
<title>Anaphoric missing objects in Polish</title>
<p>Polish has been described as a language blocking pronominal object drop (as opposed to pronominal subject omission), for example, in Pisarkowa (1968, 1969). Yet even these works note that in some syntactic contexts, for example, with subordinate clauses whose subject is coreferential with the missing object, the object can be dropped (Pisarkowa 1968:192):</p>
<list id="q_116" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(116)</label><p>A ty wychodziszbez po&#x017C;egnaniai zmuszasz (mnie), and you get.out-2sG without goodbye andforce-2sG me &#x017C;ebym goni&#x0142;a ci&#x0119; po mrozie. so.that-1SGchase-SG.F you at frost</p>
<p>&#x2018;And you get out without a goodbye and make me chase you in the</p>
<p>cold.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>Pisarkowa (1968) suggests that this is possible especially with first and second person, but less so with third person, where, according to her, establishing the intended referent is more difficult (Pisarkowa 1968:192):</p>
<list id="q_117" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(117)</label><p>Potempytano	(jego), czyjest ojcemtego znanego later ask-iMPRSNL him if is father this well-known lekkoatlety.</p>
<p>athlete</p>
<p>&#x2018;They asked him later if he was the father of this well-known athlete.&#x2019;</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>[Polish]</p>
<list id="q_118" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>&#x2018;He opened his mouth, didn&#x2019;t know what to say, so he shut it imme diately [...]&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>Despite the examples above, Pisarkowa (1968) considers anaphoric object drop as a marginal phenomenon in the grammar of Polish. Furthermore, on the basis of examples such as (119)-(120), translated from Cummins &#x0026; Roberge (2004), Bu&#x0142;at (2009) suggests that Polish makes it impossible for definite and referential objects to be null.</p>
<list id="q_119" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(119)</label><p>Wyci&#x0105;gni&#x0119;to do niego d&#x0142;o&#x0144;. Zdenerowany, *zignorowa&#x0142; &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>&#x2018;A hand was extended to him. Annoyed, *he ignored &#x00F8;.&#x2019; [Polish]</p>
<list id="q_120" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(120)</label><p>Je&#x015B;li facet proponuje Ci kaw&#x0119;, *rzu&#x0107; &#x00F8; mu w twarz.</p>
<p>&#x2018;If a guy offers you a coffee, *throw &#x00F8; in his face.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>Object drop is also blocked in Polish in sentences parallel to the English <italic>visit-</italic>type examples from (102)&#x2013;(104) above:</p>
<p>206</p>
<list id="q_121" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(121)</label><p>Prawie nikogo nie widuj&#x0119; odk&#x0105;d si&#x0119; przeprowadzi&#x0142;am na almost nobody not see-1SG since <sc><bold>se </bold></sc>moved-1SG.F on przedmie&#x015B;cia.

<p>od dawna). from longtime &#x2018;I see almost nobody since I moved to the suburbs. Jan visited me</p>
<p>yesterday (as the first in a long time).&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>However, the picture of missing objects in Polish is more complex. Sa-loni (1976) discusses a number of relevant examples, which show that omission is possible with both non-referential (see (122)) and referential (see (123)) antecedents (Saloni 1976:126). According to him, omitting an object is most natural in dialogue situations.</p>
<list id="q_122" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(122)</label><p>A: Czy Janek ma psa?</p>
<p>whether Janek has dog-Ace &#x2018;Does Janek have a dog?&#x2019;</p>
<p>B: Kupi&#x0142;	&#x00F8; wczoraj.</p>

<p>B: Kupi&#x0142;	&#x00F8; wczoraj.</p>
<p>bought-3sG.M yesterday &#x2018;He bought it yesterday.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>In fact, corpus data show that, just as in English, a variety of factors can license object drop in Polish (cf. chapter 5). For example, definite missing objects appear in the corpus in the context of licensing by contrast:</p>
<list id="q_124" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(124)</label><p>Obupan&#x00F3;w	&#x0142;&#x0105;czy mi&#x0142;o&#x015B;&#x0107; do pi&#x0142;ki no&#x017C;nej. Dzieli &#x00F8;</p>
<p>both gentlemen-Ace unites love to ball foot-ADj divides wizja kierowaniaparti&#x0105;. vision leading party</p>
<p>&#x2018;Both gentlemen are united by their love for football. They are di vided by their vision for leading the party.&#x2019;	[NKJP]</p>
<p>Emphasis on the verb is also a licensing factor for missing objects in Polish, as shown in (125), where choosing stands in opposition to not choosing.</p>
<list id="q_125" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(125)</label><p>Zawsze s&#x0142;uchamy dyktatu i wybieramy, co</p>

<p>what is more profitable, or what has stupefied us completely. But</p>
<p>we choose.&#x2019;	[NKJP]</p>
<p>A particularly favourable environment for definite missing objects is constituted by conversations, as has already been observed in Saloni (1976) and is</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>confirmed by corpus data. In this case it is very natural for the referent of the object to be established based on the extra-linguistic situation rather than on overt linguistic material, as illustrated in (126)&#x2013;(127).<sup>24</sup></p>
<list id="q_126" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(126)</label><p>A: nie pogniewasz si&#x0119; ka jak nie doko&#x0144;cz&#x0119; &#x00F8;?</p>

<p>&#x2018;No, if you don&#x2019;t like it, don&#x2019;t eat it.&#x2019;	[NKJP]</p>
<list id="q_127" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>&#x2018;Let go of me or I will kill you.&#x2019;	[NKJP]</p>
<p>Different cues from the surrounding linguistic material can also be used to identify the referent of the missing object. For example, (128) shows that subject agreement morphology in a following clause can serve as a cue, whereas in (129) the following noun phrase makes the referent clear.</p>
<list id="q_128" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(128)</label><p>Chwali &#x00F8;,&#x017C;e co jak co, ale &#x015B;wi&#x0119;towa&#x0107; umiemy.</p>

<p>celebrate.&#x2019;	[NKJP]</p>
<p><sup>24</sup>The dialogue in (126) is a transcript of a spoken conversation (capital letters are not used in transcribed texts in NKJP). The element <italic>ka </italic>seems to be a performance error.</p>
<p>209</p>
<list id="q_129" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(129)</label><p>Dobrze wychowany m&#x0142;odzieniec &#x2014; chwali &#x00F8; babcia, gdy well brought.up young.man praises grandma when Marcin znika w mroku nocy. Marcin disappears in darkness night &#x2018;&#x201C;A well-behaved young man&#x201D;, grandma praises him when Marcin</p>
<p>disappears in the darkness of the night.&#x2019;	[NKJP]</p>
<p>In addition to the definite contexts above, anaphoric object drop can also target non-specific objects. Based on examples such as (130), McShane (1999) suggests that the lexicon of Polish includes an inherently null anaphor lexically specified as nondefinite and nondiscrete, used in contexts which require the use of <italic>some </italic>in English (McShane 1999:72).</p>
<list id="q_130" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(130)</label><p>Narogu sprzedawali pomara&#x0144;cze, wi&#x0119;c kupi&#x0142;am</p>

<p>par&#x0119;/	troch&#x0119;/ &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>a.few-Acc a.little-Acc</p>
<p>&#x2018;They were selling oranges on the corner, and/so I bought some.&#x2019;</p>
<p>[Polish]</p>
<p>As McShane (1999) notes, for some speakers the pronoun <italic>je </italic>&#x2018;them&#x2019; can be used in (130) as well in the absence of <italic>par&#x0119; </italic>&#x2018;a few&#x2019; and <italic>troch&#x0119; </italic>&#x2018;a little&#x2019;.</p>
<p>McShane (1999, 2000, 2005) also shows that anaphoric object drop is acceptable in a relatively wide range of contexts in Polish, with some types of contexts favouring it for discourse-pragmatic reasons, even though a definite null object</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>can usually be replaced with a pronominal clitic (McShane 1999:60):<sup>25</sup></p>

<p>No semantic difference is detectable between these options, even though this is not always the case. The corpus example in (132), featuring three missing objects, provides an interesting contrast in this respect.</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>The &#x2018;&#x0025;&#x2019; marking in (131d) signalises that some speakers find the second occurrence of the clitic overly repetitive.</p>

<p>In this example, the second missing object is interpreted as a phone, even though the first and the third missing object is interpreted as someone with a phone based on preceding discourse. By contrast, in (133), where the missing objects are substituted with pronominal clitics, the only interpretation available to the second pronominal clitic is that of the preceding clitic, that is the clitic has to be interpreted as referring to a person with a phone.</p>

<p>In contrast to the preceding examples, in structures referred to as the &#x2018;assertion + elaboration&#x2019; strategy in McShane (1999:64), object drop is blocked in Polish and instead an overt pronominal is required:<sup>26</sup></p>
<list id="q_134" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(134)</label><p>Zjad&#x0142;amtrzy pierogi.	Samaje/	*&#x00F8; zrobi&#x0142;am.</p>
<p>ate-1SG three dumplings-Acc alone them-Acc made-1sc &#x2018;I ate three dumplings. I made them myself.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>When licensed, missing objects are available in islands in Polish (Kowaluk 1999), suggesting that they are not represented as variables bound by a null topic in the left periphery of the clause (see, a.o., Huang 1984; Raposo 1986 for analyses along these lines):<sup>27</sup></p>
<p><sup>26</sup>For some discussion of discourse factors influencing the possibilities of object drop in Polish, see McShane (1999, 2000). In addition to discourse factors, animacy seems to play a role, inanimate objects being dropped more often than animate objects (Mykhaylyk &#x0026; Sopata 2016). See Erteschik-Shir et al. (2013) for an approach to the animacy factor in Hebrew object drop in terms of differential object marking.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>The examples in (135) and (136) substitute for Kowaluk&#x2019;s (1999) original examples, because her examples do not strike me as unacceptable with <italic>wh</italic>-movement out of the islands.</p>
<p>In general, the purpose of Kowaluk&#x2019;s paper is to report on her study of Polish learners of English as a second language, establishing a correlation between the patterns of anaphoric object drop and the development of the determiner system. Even though she does not provide the full set of her test sentences, based on the examples in text, it seems that she has used the context with</p>

<p>In sum, the data discussed in the literature suggest that anaphoric object drop in Polish is available, but it is constrained by contextual factors, including the information-structural alignment of the sentence.</p>

<p>polar (<italic>Yes/No</italic>) questions to test the use of null objects.

<p>Object drop with an antecedent which is situationally salient, but is not present in the linguistic context, is also possible in Hungarian (N&#x00E9;meth T. 2000:1673):</p>

<p>Indefinite missing objects can also be interpreted with reference to a situationally-salient entity, as illustrated in (140) from N&#x00E9;meth T. (2000:1675&#x2013;1676), where the definiteness of the object is reflected in the verb form.<sup>29</sup> In particular, the verbs <italic>kapott </italic>&#x2018;got&#x2019; and <italic>adott </italic>&#x2018;gave&#x2019; are inflected according to the indefinite paradigm, suggesting that the missing object is interpreted as an indefinite (some bread). The third occurrence of a missing object is definite, the verb <italic>megette </italic>being inflected in accordance with the definite paradigm. This time the object refers to the piece of bread which P&#x00E9;ter gave to P&#x00E1;l.</p>
<list id="q_140" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p><sup>29</sup>In short, Hungarian has two conjugational paradigms, the choice between which is conditioned by the features of the object (and the subject). Roughly speaking, when the verb is intransitive or appears with an indefinite object, the so-called indefinite (or subjective) conjugation is used and when the object is definite, the definite (or objective) conjugation is used (see section 3.3.3.1 in chapter 3 for more details).</p>

<p>First/second-person objects can also be dropped. Even though the literature usually states that only singular objects can be dropped, as illustrated in (137)-(138) above, Keresztes (2013:56) presents data from her acceptability study, whose results diverge from this view.<sup>30</sup> In particular, even though the omission of third-person plural objects is confirmed to be unacceptable, dropping first/second-person plural objects is not judged as degraded to the same extent. The study reported in Keresztes (2013) shows that first-person plural object drop is judged almost as acceptable as singular object drop, with the omission of a second-person plural object felt to be a bit worse than the dropping of a first-person plural object, but still acceptable (as determined by judgments expressed on a 7-point scale). I present a set of examples with plural objects used in the study in (141). First/second-person singular object drop is as acceptable as third-person singular object drop.</p>

<p>Interpretation of a first/second-person missing object as plural is available if there are clear linguistic or extra-linguistic contextual cues favouring this interpretation. In the absence of such cues, the default interpretation of the object is singular (the number feature of the object is not reflected in verbal morphol-ogy).<sup>31</sup> This may be a reflex of the complex semantics of the pluralisation of first/second-person pronouns. In particular, even though the speaker and hearer are salient in context, this is not necessarily so for the speaker&#x2019;s or the hearer&#x2019;s group. For this reason arriving at the interpretation where the speaker or the hearer and their associates are meant rather than only the speaker or the hearer requires some more context.<sup>32</sup></p>
<p>In accordance with the conjugational system of Hungarian, the combination</p>
<p><sup>31</sup>I would like to thank Professor Istv&#x00E1;n Kenesei for drawing my attention to this fact.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup>There is inherent ambiguity introduced by pluralisation of first/second-person pronouns, where the plural can mean the speaker/hearer and their contextually-relevant associates or can mean the plurality of speakers (a much less frequent type of a situation involving speaking in unison) or the plurality of listeners. See, for example, Wechsler (2010) and references cited therein for some discussion.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>of a first-person singular subject and a second-person object requires the special marker <italic>-lAk </italic>(see (142)). The combination of a second-person subject and a first-person object requires the verb to be used in the indefinite conjugation (see (143)).<sup>33</sup> This does not interfere with object drop, as illustrated in (142)&#x2013;(143) from Kenesei et al. (1998:262). When there can be ambiguity with respect to the intended referent of the object, even a singular object is expressed overtly, as in (144) from Kenesei et al. (1998:262). In this case omitting the object would result in ambiguity between first and second person. When discourse makes clear which of these is intended, the object can be dropped, as (145) from &#x00C9;. Kiss (2012:195) shows.</p>

<title>A note on reflexives</title>
<p>Reflexive verbs are also included in some discussions of missing objects in English (see, e.g., Cote 1996). The reason is that sentences such as (148a) can also be expressed as in (148b).</p>
<list id="q_148" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(148)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_148a"><label>a.</label><p>John washed himself. b. John washed &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>Among verbs which license this alternation are <italic>bathe, change, dress, preen, shave, shower, </italic>and <italic>wash </italic>(Levin 1993). In Polish, such reflexive verbs are marked with the <sc><bold>se </bold></sc>morpheme <italic>si&#x0119;, </italic>shown in (149), whereas in Hungarian, reflexive verbs are derived with reflexivising suffixes, exemplified in (150) from Kenesei et al. (1998:129).</p>
<list id="q_149" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(149)</label><p>Jan si&#x0119; umy&#x0142;. Jan <sc><bold>se </bold></sc>washed</p>

<p>&#x2018;You are washing (yourselves).&#x2019;	[Hungarian]</p>
<p>As non-reflexive missing objects in Polish and Hungarian do not involve ad-</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>ditional verbal markers, a unified analysis of reflexives and missing objects seems unlikely. Due to the numerous complications involved in the proper analysis of reflexivisation, I leave it for future research to determine whether a uniform treatment of reflexives and structures with object drop is viable for English.<sup>35</sup></p>
<p><bold>4.5 Problems of interpretation: <italic>win &#x00F8;</italic></bold></p>
<p>The interpretive properties of missing objects, and in particular their context-dependence and flexibility, have raised the questions of the proper characterisation of the nature of their interpretation and of their status as full-fledged semantic arguments that are implicit, as opposed to constructions involving an arity reduction in the logical structure of the verb. These questions have sparked a contro-</p>
<p><sup>35</sup>See Alexiadou et al. (2013) for an attempt, which, however, crucially depends on the approach to object drop in Rappaport Hovav &#x0026; Levin (1998, 2010). I discuss some problems which this analysis faces in section 5.2.2 of chapter 5.</p>
<p>The same pattern as is observed with reflexives is found with reciprocal verbs such as <italic>meet, date, hug, kiss</italic>, etc., where the object can be expressed with the reciprocal <italic>each other</italic>, but need not be overtly present (Levin 1993). I do not discuss these verbs here, similarly to verbs such as <italic>jam, cram, load, pack, jerk, pull, </italic>and <italic>yank</italic>, which make it possible for the reflexive object to be dropped (Levin 1993:36):</p>
<p>(i) a. We loaded ourselves onto the bus. b. We loaded &#x00F8; onto the bus.</p>
<p>(ii) a. We pulled ourselves free. b. We pulled &#x00F8; free.</p>
<p>As noted in Levin (1993), in Romance and Slavic languages, such verbs appearing without the reflexive object are accompanied by an overt clitic.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p>versy in some analyses focusing on the verb <italic>win</italic>. Considering <italic>win </italic>together with some other context-dependent predicates (e.g. <italic>apply</italic>, <italic>local</italic>, and <italic>near</italic>), Condo-ravdi &#x0026; Gawron (1996) show that implicit arguments of such predicates can be interpreted with reference to the context of the utterance or to previous linguistic discourse, and, when appearing in the scope of a quantifier, they can be interpreted as bound variables, even though not all predicates in this group allow all of these possibilities. Condoravdi &#x0026; Gawron (1996) point out that implicit arguments behave like pronouns in these cases in that they can be interpreted with reference to all types of contexts noted above. On the other hand, they also resemble definite descriptions, as they do not require an overt antecedent and, in some cases, are not interpreted in parallel with pronouns (Condoravdi &#x0026; Gawron 1996:10):<sup>36</sup></p>
<list id="q_151" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(151)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_151a"><label>a.</label><p>Every man who bet on the Superbowl won &#x00F8;.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>= Every man who bet on the Superbowl won the bet.</p>
<p>c.	&#x2260; Every man who bet on the Superbowl won it.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup>Substituting a non-anaphoric missing object of a verb such as <italic>eat </italic>with a pronoun is also impossible (Ruppenhofer 2004:405):</p>
<p>(i) A: Are you hungry? B: &#x0023;No, I&#x2019;ve eaten it.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>Contra Condoravdi &#x0026; Gawron (1996), Pedersen (2011:170) argues that the implicit argument of <italic>win </italic>should not be analysed as a definite null complement. He bases his argument on examples such as (152), where the unrealised argument of <italic>win </italic>is understood as <italic>some money </italic>rather than as <italic>the bet they make</italic>.</p>
<list id="q_152" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(152)</label><p>Everyone who enters this casino is guaranteed to win &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>The example in (153) likewise suggests that the implicit argument of <italic>win </italic>can be indefinite (Pedersen 2011:171).</p>
<list id="q_153" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(153)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_153a"><label>a.</label><p>Every man who bet on Green Bay won &#x00F8;, but not very much.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Every man who bet on Green Bay won some money, but not very much.</p>
<p>c.	&#x0023;Every man who bet on Green Bay won the bet he made, but</p>
<p>not very much.</p>
<p>In addition, AnderBois (2012:51) shows that a missing object of <italic>win </italic>can refer to a bet even when it is indefinite, as suggested by the fact that it can antecede</p>
<p>sluicing:<sup>37</sup></p>
<p><sup>37</sup>Similarly, Groefsema (1995:142) notes that a missing object of <italic>win </italic>does not need to be interpreted as referring to a contextually salient entity, as illustrated in (i), where the object is understood as some tennis match, without there being any particular sports event introduced into the discourse.</p>
<p>224</p>
<list id="q_154" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(154)</label><p>Fred definitely won &#x00F8;, but I&#x2019;m not sure which bet.</p>
<p>Analysing these facts, AnderBois (2012) introduces a third class of implicit arguments in addition to definite and indefinite implicit arguments, that is flexible implicit arguments. These arguments share some properties with both of the other classes. They can refer to an entity salient in discourse and can be antecedents for sluicing, even though not at the same time. AnderBois (2012) suggests that flexible internal arguments are not true semantic arguments of the predicates present in the argument structure. Instead, they are existential lexical entailments.<sup>38</sup> However, this analysis cannot be maintained in the light of the observation in Williams (2012:128) that the missing object of <italic>win </italic>makes the bound variable reading available, behaving similarly to both pronouns and definite descriptions in this respect:</p>
<p>(i) Martina Navratilova has won &#x00F8; again.</p>
<p><sup>38</sup>This analysis seems reminiscent of a proposal made in Larson (1988), who focuses mostly on implicit arguments denoting sources and goals, illustrated in (i) from Larson (1988:169), di-transitive structures, and nominals, and analyses them within the Situation Semantics framework. In short, he proposes that implicit arguments of these types are licensed by inference relying on the knowledge of relations between events. In particular, such implicit arguments are licensed by virtue of contributing semantically to the event which is inferred rather than to the one which is described directly, a process guided by necessary or conventional constraints on relations between events.</p>
<p>(i) John ran (from the house) (to the store) (along the river).</p>
<p>By contrast, according to AnderBois (2012), indefinite implicit arguments are present in the semantics (see Recanati 2007 for an opposing view).</p>
<p>225</p>
<list id="q_155" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(155)</label><p>Every contest seems fair to the guy who won (it/the task).</p>
<p>Since a bound variable reading can be possible only if the relevant variable is available, this example shows clearly that the internal argument <italic>of win </italic>is present in the semantics (see also Williams 2015 for some relevant discussion).</p>
<p>Williams (2012) analyses sentences such as <italic>Ron won &#x00F8; </italic>by treating the missing argument as a number-neutral definite description lacking descriptive content. To this effect, Williams postulates the self-identity condition in the representation of the argument, which is trivially satisfied (i.e. <italic>Won</italic>(Ron,[,y(y = y)])). With <italic><bold>i </bold></italic>shifting a predicate to an individual, this analysis accounts for the definite readings of the missing object. Indefinite readings need to be accounted for separately.</p>

<title>Conclusion and outlook</title>
<p>In this chapter, I have shown that missing objects can be non-anaphoric (section 4.2) or anaphoric (section 4.3). The latter can be interpreted either as definite or as indefinite. There are restrictions on both types of missing objects. The most salient property of non-anaphoric missing objects is their sensitivity to verb types and special licensing contexts, which I discuss in greater detail in the following chapter. Interpretive properties of these objects, such as general versus spe-</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>cialised meaning and their scopal properties constitute important factors which have been used to argue for specific types of approaches to their analysis. In section 4.2, I have provided some arguments against treating (all) structures with non-anaphoric missing objects as including an intransitive variant of a transitive verb and against encoding the alternation directly in the lexicon.</p>
<p>Non-anaphoric missing objects pattern similarly in English, Polish, and Hungarian, but anaphoric/definite missing objects exhibit some differences. The availability of these objects is determined by different aspects of the grammars of these languages, that is the properties of particular verbs in English, pragmatic factors in Polish, and the feature specification of the object in Hungarian.</p>
<p>A number of types of argument drop has been distinguished in the literature. This includes <italic>p ro -</italic>drop, conditioned by rich agreement and familiar from subject drop in languages such as Italian (see, e.g., Chomsky 1982; Rizzi 1982), topic drop, constrained by the presence of elements in the CP area, as observed, for example, in Swedish (see Sigur&#x00F0;sson 2011 and references cited therein), and discourse drop, where there are no clause-specific restrictions, but where argument drop can be constrained by other factors (e.g. island sensitivity), as observed in languages such as Mandarin (see, e.g., Huang 1984; Raposo 1986). Definite object drop in English, Polish, and Hungarian resembles most closely the last pattern, even though the particular restrictions imposed on it vary greatly between</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>the languages.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, I look more closely at the environments in which missing objects appear, with a view to isolating some factors which can license and constrain object drop.</p>

<body>
<p>Building on the discussion of the issues anchored in the interpretive properties of missing objects in chapter 4, in this chapter I focus on the ways in which missing objects interact with various features of their linguistic and extra-linguistic environment. I employ mostly English data for presentation, but, to the best of my knowledge, the facts observed for English also hold in Polish and Hungarian. I specifically discuss Polish and Hungarian only in reference to some factors observed in these languages, but absent in English.</p>
<p>The chapter begins with introductory remarks in section 5.1, followed by a discussion of some selected issues related to particular verb types and their fea-</p>
<p>tures, including selectional restrictions (section 5.2.1) and the manner and result components of verb meaning (section 5.2.2). I show here that the appeal to the specificity of verbal selectional restrictions in investigations of factors licensing object drop is empirically problematic. Furthermore, extant literature offers conflicting views on the role of manner specification in licensing object drop.</p>
<p>In section 5.3, the discussion shifts to features of the predicate and the sentence, including the potential interactions between object drop and <italic>aktionsart</italic>, telicity, and grammatical aspect. I provide data showing that none of the categories distinguished within these classifications blocks object drop in its own right. I then discuss some additional factors licensing missing objects in section 5.4, that is habituality, genericity, and iterativity (section 5.4.1) as well as contrast, emphasis on the action, verb sequences, and stress on an element other than the object (section 5.4.2). The data show that a multitude of factors can influence the acceptability of a missing object.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the observations commonly made in the literature on missing objects in English is that their distribution is heavily lexically-constrained, as discussed, for example, by Fillmore (1986). This seems to be true both in terms of making object drop available and in terms of the way in which the object is interpreted, as I have explained in chapter 4. In view of this, Fillmore (1986) concludes that no purely semantic or pragmatic explanation can capture the data and suggests that lexical items carry information specifying that their complements are marked as indefinite or definite omissible. The most frequently evoked contrast in this respect is the difference between the verb <italic>eat</italic>, which makes null objects available, and the verb <italic>devour</italic>, which (allegedly) does not. For example, Jackendoff (1990) suggests that the lexical entry of <italic>eat</italic>, but not that of <italic>devour</italic>, specifies that the thing eaten is only optionally chosen as an argument, as already observed in section 4.2 of chapter 4. However, the empirical data are more complex than a simple lexical specification of particular items would predict. More specifically, in some contexts, the object can be missing even with <italic>devour </italic>(P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux et al. 2008:380):</p>

<p>Non-anaphoric object drop in (1) seems to be made possible by habituality, as I discuss in more detail in section 5.4.1. Similarly, anaphoric/definite object drop can be licensed in a variety of environments in Polish. For example, McShane (1999, 2000, 2005) identifies different factors (dis)favouring object drop in Polish, including repetition, illustrated in (2) from McShane (2000:111).</p>

<title>Features of the verb</title>
<p>This section discusses the ways in which selectional restrictions and the manner and result components of verb meaning have been analysed in the literature to influence object drop.</p>

<label>5.2.1</label>
<title>Selectional restrictions</title>
<p>Rice (1988) links the ability of a verb to appear with a missing object to the nature of the default interpretation of such an object. More specifically, according to her, objects whose semantic content is most probable with a particular verb meaning are omissible. For example, the verb <italic>smoke </italic>can be used without an object if the object is <italic>cigarettes</italic>, but not when it is <italic>Marlboros/a pipe</italic>. Furthermore, she suggests that the unacceptability of object drop in the following examples results from the verbs taking too broad a range of objects, thereby not being associated with any default object which could be inferred (Rice 1988:207):</p>
<list id="q_3" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(3)</label><p>*Someone opened &#x00F8;/shut &#x00F8;/closed &#x00F8;/sealed &#x00F8;/locked &#x00F8;.</p>
<list id="q_4" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(4)</label><p>*He made &#x00F8;/built &#x00F8;/fabricated &#x00F8;/constructed &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>Even though not phrased in these terms, Rice&#x2019;s observations are related to se-lectional properties of verbs, which have sometimes been taken to be a crucial factor determining the acceptability of object drop with specific verbs. For example, proposing an information-theoretic model of selectional constraints, Resnik (1996) notices that arguments which are strongly selected for are more easily inferred (see also Resnik 1993). He further suggests that selectional preference</p>
<p>233</p>
<p>strength (i.e. the amount of information which a verb carries about its argument) can predict whether a verb can appear with a null object. Verbs which can be found with (either definite or indefinite) null objects are reported to be the ones for which selectional preference strength is high (informally speaking, their objects tend to be felt as typical by native speakers, which is why the content of the objects is easy to infer). The following examples from Olsen &#x0026; Resnik (1997:6) illustrate this:</p>
<list id="q_5" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(5)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_5a"><label>a.</label><p>Benjamin ate lunch/a sandwich/something yummy. b. Benjamin ate &#x00F8;.</p>

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_8a"><label>a.</label><p>Benjamin found a toy/help/my keys. b. *Benjamin found &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>However, as the examples in (9)&#x2013;(10) show, object drop is possible with some verbs which select only for one type of complement, but it is blocked with others</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>(Rice 1988:205&#x2013;206):<sup>1</sup></p>
<list id="q_9" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>John barked *(his shin).</p>
<p>c.	John sprained *(his wrist/his ankle).</p>
<p>What is more, even though the verbs <italic>eat </italic>and <italic>devour </italic>have parallel selectional restrictions, object drop outside of special licensing contexts is available only with the former one. Thus, it seems that reference to selectional restrictions is not enough to account for the full spectrum of data with missing objects, even though selection can certainly play a central role in the process of determining the interpretation of a missing object.</p>

<label>5.2.2</label>
<title>Meaning components: manner and result</title>
<p>Object drop has been discussed in the context of the manner/result distinction in theories of verb meanings, exemplified in (11). The original observation is that verbs lexicalising manner, but not verbs lexicalising result, are licensed with unspecified and non-subcategorised objects, as illustrated in (12)&#x2013;(13) from Rappa-<sup>1</sup>Ruppenhofer &#x0026; Michaelis (2013) make the same point in reference to the verb <italic>devein</italic>, whose object can only be noun phrases headed by the noun <italic>shrimp</italic>, but which does not license object drop.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>port Hovav &#x0026; Levin (2010:21) (see also Rappaport Hovav &#x0026; Levin 1998; Levin 1999; Beavers &#x0026; Koontz-Garboden 2012 for relevant discussions).</p>

<p>Rappaport Hovav &#x0026; Levin (1998:109) propose realisation rules which determine how the integration of a root into an event schema is governed by its ontological category. I provide their predicate decomposition of manner roots here in (14a) and the predicate decomposition of the externally-caused, result-state ontological type in (14b).</p>
<list id="q_14" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(14)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_14a"><label>a.</label><p>[x ACT&#x003C;MANNER&#x003E;]</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>[[x ACT] CAUSE [y BECOME &#x003C;RESULT-STATE&#x003E;]]</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>For transitive manner verbs, Rappaport Hovav &#x0026; Levin (1998) assume that the participant expressed by the object is licensed by the root (the constant in their terms), whereas the subject argument (agent) is associated with the variable in the event structure template (x in (14a)). By contrast, two subevents are encoded in event structure templates of result verbs, namely a causing activity and a change of state, and both participants of the event are associated with variables in the template (x and y in (14b)).<sup>2</sup> Rappaport Hovav &#x0026; Levin (1998) suggest that each participant associated with a variable in the event structure template must be realised syntactically and formulate this requirement as follows (Rappaport Hovav &#x0026; Levin 1998:113):<sup>3</sup></p>
<list id="q_15" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(15)</label><p><italic>Argument Realisation Condition</italic></p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_a"><label>a.</label><p>There must be an argument XP in the syntax for each structure participant in the event structure.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Each argument XP in the syntax must be associated with an</p>
<p>identified subevent in the event structure.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>However, Neeleman &#x0026; van de Koot (2012) argue against including the causing event/CAUSE in the linguistic representation of causative events.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>Rappaport Hovav (2008) proposes that the object is needed with scalar-change verbs because it provides a scale along which the extent of change of state can be measured. The verb itself does not provide a scale, which is why to measure the event, the event is mapped onto the scale provided by the object.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p>On the other hand, the only condition on the realisation of participants licensed by the root is that they be recoverable (either by being represented syntactically, or by prototypicality).</p>
<p>However, some predictions which the distinction between manner and result verbs makes with respect to object drop are empirically problematic. On the account in Rappaport Hovav &#x0026; Levin (1998, 2010), <italic>eat </italic>needs to be classified as a manner verb, as it makes unspecified object drop available.<sup>4</sup> However, in contrast to the verb <italic>eat</italic>, verbs expressing the manner of eating cannot be used with null objects, as (16) shows, and, further, in this case, it is the rich manner component which has been identified as the cause of the unavailability of object drop in Rice (1988:203) (see also Garc&#x00ED;a Velasco &#x0026; Portero Mu&#x00F1;oz 2002 for some discussion).<sup>5</sup></p>
<list id="q_16" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>In addition to verbs expressing the manner of eating, the following items encod-<sup>4</sup>Levin (2013) explicitly categorises <italic>eat </italic>as a manner verb.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>There might be some inter-speaker variation with respect to the particular verbs blocking object drop. For example, my informant accepts (16) with <italic>nibble </italic>and <italic>chew </italic>and marks <italic>sip </italic>in (18) as degraded, but better than the other options. Similarly, Mittwoch (2005) includes verbs such as <italic>chew, revise (what has been learnt)</italic>, and <italic>rehearse </italic>among the ones which make object drop possible. This contrasts with the judgments presented in Rice (1988).</p>

<p>Rice (1988) suggests that in these cases the default interpretation of the object may be disfavoured as a result of the degree of specificity added to the action by manner specification and that object drop is in general facilitated by verb</p>
<p>neutrality. Moreover, she suggests that verbs whose meaning includes not only</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Note that these examples are also problematic for the accounts that attribute the patterns of object drop to the selectional restrictions of particular verbs (see section 5.2.1). The verbs in the respective examples are parallel as far as this property is concerned.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>action but also the manner in which the action is performed block object drop.<sup>7 </sup>The examples above show clearly that rich manner specification can block object drop. However, some further data complicate the relation between the degree of manner specificity and object drop. In particular, verbs such as <italic>sweep, dust, hoover, </italic>and <italic>iron </italic>can be used with missing objects (see Mittwoch 2005), even though their manner component is quite specific. It thus seems that different approaches discussed above might need to be combined to account for the data. I provide some relevant discussion of these issues in section 2.3 of chapter 2.</p>
<p>The manner/result distinction has also been characterised in terms of the classification of verbs into non-core and core transitive or mono-eventive and bi-eventive. The two types can be distinguished by transitivity tests developed in Bresnan (1982), Levin (1999), Levin &#x0026; Rappaport Hovav (1999), and Kratzer (2005), quoted here from Alexiadou et al.

<p>The factor taken to underlie these tests is that verbs whose thematic object cannot be dropped should not make it possible for the direct object position to be occupied by a non-subcategorised object, which is taken to be the case in (23)&#x2013; (29). Yet, it is unclear whether these examples show anything beyond the fact that verbs such as <italic>b reak </italic>do not (usually) make object drop possible. It has not been shown that the non-subcategorised phrases in fact occupy the object positions. Furthermore, not all of the tests are completely reliable. For example, the <italic>x &#x2018;s-way </italic>construction has also been reported to be acceptable with verbs classified</p>
<p>242</p>
<p>as resultative, as shown in (30) and (31) quoted in Goldberg (2001:509) from the Oxford University Press corpus and in (32) from Levin (1993:99).<sup>8</sup></p>

<list id="q_32" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(32)</label><p>The explorers cut their way through the jungle.</p>
<p>One other point which these examples reveal is that the Argument Realisation Condition, presented in (15) above, might not be adequate to capture the data. In particular, even though the verbs <italic>murder</italic>, <italic>destroy</italic>, and <italic>cut </italic>encode result, the participant associated with the y variable (e.g. people in (30)) is not expressed</p>
<p>overtly.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p><sup>8</sup>The following example from the Brown Corpus is similar, involving a verb which can be classified as encoding both manner and result (see section 2.3 of chapter 2 for more discussion of this verb type):</p>
<p>(i) Grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl.	[Brown]</p>
<p><sup>9</sup>Sentences in which the path of motion is predicated of an unrealised argument have also been used to challenge the proposal thatat least one argument thatis associated with each subevent in an event structure template must be expressed syntactically. Goldberg (2005:219) provides examples such as the following to illustrate the point:</p>
<p>(i) Pat blew &#x00F8; onto the computer screen.</p>
<p>According to Goldberg (2005:219), sentences of this type have their semantic decompositions as</p>
<p>243</p>
<p>Another problematic case is the <italic>out-</italic>prefixation structure, illustrated in (23). More specifically, Beavers &#x0026; Koontz-Garboden (2012:339&#x2013;340) point out that judgments are not very sharp in this case:</p>
<list id="q_33" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(33)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_33a"><label>a.</label><p>??Kim outbroke the other vase-smasher.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>??Kim outshattered the other bottle-shatterer.</p>
<p>c.	??Kim outdestroyed the experienced wrecking crew.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Levin (1993:100) provides an example of a result verb with a non-subcategorised object, which suggests that some additional factors might be relevant for the (un)acceptability of structures of this type:</p>
<list id="q_34" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(34)</label><p>Amanda burned the stove black.</p>
<p>The tests presented above are usually taken to show that non-core transitive</p>
<p>in (ii).</p>
<p>(ii) Pat ACT&#x003C;blew&#x003E;</p>
<p>BECOME [air &#x003C;onto the computer screen&#x003E;]</p>
<p>Goldberg (2005) uses this as an argument against the Argument Realisation Condition. However, as noted in section 4.2 of chapter 4, it is unclear that an analysis of PPs in contexts such as (i) as predicated of the missing object is correct. An alternative worth exploring is event modification, especially that these structures do not share the telic property with resultatives.</p>
<p>Goldberg (2005) notes in addition that the optionality of expressing the object with verbs of contribution such as <italic>contribute, donate</italic>, and <italic>give (to the foundation) </italic>constitutes a similar problem for the Argument Realisation Condition, as the omission of the participant which changes its location/possessor does not result in unacceptability.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p>verbs need not have the internal argument in the syntactic structure. The test sentences are compared with examples such as (35)&#x2013;(36), which show that two direct objects are impossible (Alexiadou et al. 2013:9).</p>
<list id="q_35" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(35)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_35a"><label>a.</label><p>John out-ate (*pizza) Mary (*pizza). b. Mary drank (*the water) teapot dry.</p>
<list id="q_36" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(36)</label><p>John ate (*pizza) himself (*pizza) fat (*pizza).</p>
<p>However, interpreting these examples requires caution, as they are unacceptable for an independent reason. More specifically, in GB terms, adding the third noun phrase in (35)&#x2013;(36) yields a classic configuration of Case Filter violation. A weaker claim compatible with these examples is that the subcategorised internal argument is represented in the structure in a way which does not require case valuation. If this is correct, the verb can value case on the non-subcategorised noun phrases in contexts such as (23)&#x2013;(29), but not in (35)&#x2013;(36), where both the subcategorised and the non-subcategorised objects are overt and need to have their case valued. I provide some additional arguments supporting the hypothesis that the missing object lacks case in the theoretical discussion in section 2.2.1 of chapter 2.</p>

<title>Features of the predicate/sentence</title>
<p>In this section, I focus on the potential interactions between object drop and <italic>aktionsart</italic>, telicity, and grammatical aspect. The main aim is to establish whether the classifications that they express interact with object drop so as to impose inherent constraints on the availability of dropping an object. In section 5.3.1, I draw on previous accounts of <italic>aktionsart </italic>and grammatical aspect in English, Polish, and Hungarian to show what strategies the languages under study here employ for encoding differences in the temporal constitution of the situations that verbal predicates and sentences denote. In section 5.3.2, I offer a preliminary discussion of the interactions between object drop and telicity, <italic>aktionsarten</italic>, as well as grammatical aspect. I show here that although telicity, <italic>aktionsart</italic>, and grammatical aspect may have an influence on the omissibility of the object argument, none of them blocks object drop in English, Polish, and Hungarian in its own right. Both anaphoric and non-anaphoric, definite and indefinite missing objects are found across all the <italic>aktionsarten </italic>and all the grammatical aspects in the languages studied here. While a theory of missing objects needs to take the interactions between object drop and <italic>aktionsarten </italic>as well as grammatical aspect into account, this complex issue must be left for future work.</p>

<title></italic>Aktionsart<italic>, telicity, and grammatical aspect in English, Polish, and Hungarian: some basic facts and observations</title>
<p>Following Vendler (1967), verbs are commonly divided into four main classes: states, activities, achievements, and accomplishments.<sup>10</sup> The four classes are distinguished by their temporal properties of stativity, durativity, and telicity. States are uniform or homogeneous and lack both internal structure or stages and development. But they are durative, holding of intervals of time and being true of every moment of time within the interval. Activities and accomplishments consist of parts or stages and they develop through time. Thus, they are durative and dynamic. Achievements do not unfold in time. Rather, they occur at a single moment in Vendler&#x2019;s classification. Although both activities and accomplishments are dynamic and durative, they differ with respect to telicity. As accomplishments specify a natural, finishing endpoint (telos or culmination), they are telic. Activities do not entail reaching a natural endpoint and they are atelic. Table 5.1 from Kearns (2011:158) illustrates Vendler&#x2019;s classification. Examples of each <italic>aktionsart </italic>are given in (37) after Kearns (2011:157&#x2013;158).</p>
<list id="q_37" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_37a"><label>a.</label><p><italic>State: </italic>be taller, be on, know, be different, be asleep, be in the</p>
<p><sup>10</sup>While Vendler&#x2019;s aspectual classification is probably the most well-known and influential, it has undergone substantial revision both within the Vendler-Dowty tradition in aspect studies (see Filip 2012) as well as in different semantic frameworks (see, among others, Croft 2012).</p>

<p>c.	<italic>Activity: </italic>walk, flutter, push a supermarket trolley, chat, swim, play cards</p>
<p>d.	<italic>Accomplishment: </italic>build a house, eat an apple, run a mile, do the dishes, make a speech, paint a triptych</p>
<p>Having a telos or culmination and a process part with forward movement, leading up to the finishing point, accomplishments are not homogeneous. By contrast, activities are homogeneous. This difference manifests itself in the compatibility of accomplishments with a time-span adverbial like <italic>in an hour</italic>, which indicates the time after which the endpoint has been reached. Adverbials like <italic>for an hour </italic>specify the duration of atelic events. Thus, they combine with activities as well as with states. As achievements do not have duration, an <italic>in</italic>-adverbial measures the time before an achievement event begins. These contrasts are illus-248</p>
<p>trated in (38) below from Willim (2006:80).<sup>11</sup></p>

<p>d.	<italic>Achievement</italic></p>
<p>They reached the top of the mountain *for/in three hours.</p>
<p>As is well-known, Vendler&#x2019;s classification does not apply to verbs, but to verbal predications which include the verb&#x2019;s complements and adjuncts. As <italic>build</italic></p>
<p><italic>two houses </italic>is a telic accomplishment predicate, it combines with a time-span</p>
<p><sup>11</sup>The activity predicate in (38b) is compatible with the <italic>in</italic>-adverbial only on the goal-based interpretation, where a set amount of singing is implied in an event.</p>
<p>As atelic predicates have the subinterval property, they license the entailment from the progressive to the perfect and to the simple past (Kearns 2011:164):</p>
<p>(i) a. Jones is singing entails Jones has sung.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Jones is building a shed does not entail Jones has built a shed.</p>
<p>(ii) a. Jones was singing entails Jones sang.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Jones was building a shed does not entail Jones built a shed.</p>
<p>See Kearns (2011) for further grammatical tests distinguishing between telic and atelic predicates.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p>adverbial and does not license an entailment from the progressive to simple past. By contrast, <italic>build houses </italic>is atelic and has reverse properties:</p>

<p>Even though the referential properties of the object argument of an activity predicate do not affect its <italic>aktionsart </italic>properties, as shown in (41)&#x2013;(42), the <italic>aktionsart </italic>of the predication in (39)&#x2013;(40) is determined by the referential properties of the object, referred to as the incremental theme argument.</p>

<p>The verbs with incremental theme arguments are verbs that describe situation</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>types in which the referent of the object (internal argument) of the verb undergoes an incremental change over the course of the event. This relationship has been captured by assuming that the part structure of the object stands in a ho-momorphic relation to the progress in time of the event named by the verb (see Filip 2012; Kardos 2012 for discussion). Three groups of such verbs are usually distinguished: verbs of consumption, for example <italic>eat, drink</italic>, verbs of creation, for example <italic>write, build</italic>, and verbs of performance (or intellectual creation), for example <italic>sing, read</italic>. Given the object-to-event homomorphism, if the incremental theme has a specified quantity of stuff or entities in its denotation, that is when it is quantised, the event description is not true of the subparts of the event, as the quantity of stuff or entities they involve is smaller than the amount of stuff or entities at the end of the event. Thus, incremental theme predications with quantised incremental themes are telic. By contrast, when the incremental theme object is not quantised, the predication is atelic. For example, two temporally adjacent events of pushing carts fall under the predicate <italic>push carts </italic>(see Willim 2006 for discussion).</p>
<p>As the contrast between (39)&#x2013;(40) indicates, in English, and more generally in Germanic languages, telicity arises just in case the argument that provides a (strict) mapping to the temporal trace of the event, that is the incremental theme</p>
<p>251</p>
<p>argument, is quantised.<sup>12</sup> The effect of the referential properties of incremental theme arguments on the predication is captured with the principle of aspectual composition (Krifka 1989:76), defined informally in (43) (cf. Willim 2006; Filip 2012).</p>
<list id="q_43" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(43)</label><p>An episodic incremental theme verb combined with a quantised in cremental theme argument yields a quantised complex verbal predi cate, while combined with a cumulative incremental theme, it yields an atelic complex verbal predicate.</p>
<p>Thus, English employs the object-marking strategy for encoding telicity (cf. Filip 2008). However, although a nominal argument with the definite or indefinite article is quantised, the telicity of predications with a verb of consumption like <italic>eat</italic>, a verb of creation like <italic>draw</italic>, and a verb of directed motion with an incremental path theme like <italic>run </italic>in fact is variable in English, as observed by Hay, Kennedy &#x0026; Levin (1999:139):</p>
<list id="q_44" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(44)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_44a"><label>a.</label><p>She ate the sandwich in 5 minutes.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>She ate the sandwich for 5 minutes.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup>Apart from consumption/creation predicates, also verbs of directed motion such as <italic>drive to New York </italic>and change of state verbs such as <italic>melt </italic>are commonly analysed as incremental theme verbs, where the notion of the incremental theme is extended to spatial and property paths that provide the part-structure that is mapped onto the part-structure of the event (see Filip 2012).</p>
<p>252</p>
<p>As (45) is not a contradiction, Hay et al. (1999:139) suggest that the telicity of predications with incremental (path) theme verbs arises via implicature.<sup>13</sup></p>
<list id="q_45" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(45)</label><p>She ate the sandwich but as usual she left a few bites.</p>
<p>Other examples of verbs with variable telicity are given in (46) and (47), suggesting a need for a finer-grained approach to telicity that takes into account both the verb&#x2019;s entailments of incrementality or lack thereof, the referential properties of the incremental theme, as well as linguistic and extra-linguistic context (Willim</p>
<p>2006:153, 113).<sup>14</sup></p>
<p><sup>13</sup>Nevertheless, the presence of a lexical quantifier or measure expression in the structure of an incremental theme seems to give rise to a non-cancellable implicature, as shown in (ii) below from Hay et al. (1999:139).</p>
<p>(i) She ran a race, but she didn&#x2019;t quite finish it.</p>
<p>(ii) ??She ran a mile, but she didn&#x2019;t quite finish it.</p>
<p>Variable telicity is a property of the class of predicates called degree achievements, illustrated in (iii) with the verb <italic>cool</italic>.</p>
<p>(iii) The soup cooled in an hour/for an hour.</p>
<p>Kardos (2012) builds on the commonality between variable non-scalar incremental theme verbs of creation and consumption and degree achievements. I return to her analysis later in this section. <sup>14</sup>The incremental theme is not restricted to the internal (object) argument in English. A classic example that shows that also the external (subject) argument can play a role in aspectual composition is shown in (i) from Dowty (1991), quoted here after Filip (2012:725). See also (47b).</p>
<p>(i) At the turtle race, the winning turtle crossed the finish line in 42 seconds.</p>

<p>To account for the fact that the qunantisedness of the object argument of an incremental verb is not sufficient to generate the telic interpretation (see (44)), nor is it necessary for the telic interpretation to arise (see (47b)) and further, an incremental (path) theme verb or a scalar verb is not necessary for telicity, as shown in (48), Filip (2008) suggests that telicity is neither encoded in verbs as lexical items in the Germanic languages, nor is it a property of the incremental theme (path) arguments or scales of change. Rather, in the Germanic languages, telicity is the function of the maximalisation operator <ITALIC>MAX<SUB>E</SUB> </ITALIC>which applies at the level of VP or the sentence (IP/TP) and interacts with the verb&#x2019;s arguments as well as with adjuncts, picking the maximal event in a given context, that is an event which cannot develop into any larger event (in a given context).</p>
<list id="q_48" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(48)</label><p>Mary saw seventeen clouds in three minutes/for three minutes.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>The <ITALIC>MAX<SUB>E</SUB> </ITALIC>operator is covert in the Germanic languages and what counts as a maximal event is often not entailed, but inferred by conversational implicature. This means that in interpreting an event as maximal or telic, a variety of contextual and pragmatic factors play a role. Thus, aspectual shifts such as (49) can be expected, given sufficient contextual support. The sentence in (49) can be interpreted telically if the context makes it clear that John ran a pre-determined distance in the time specified by the temporal adverbial (see also footnote 11).</p>
<list id="q_49" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(49)</label><p>John ran in less than 30 minutes today.</p>
<p>Filip&#x2019;s appeal to the role of both linguistic and extra-linguistic factors can also help explain the contrast observed by Ingham (1993/1994), quoted here after P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux et al. (2008:372) in (50) and (51).</p>

<p>In contrast to English and the Germanic languages in general, in Filip&#x2019;s theory of telicity, the Slavic languages employ the verb-encoding strategy rather than</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>the object-encoding strategy for encoding telicity. In Slavic languages, unlike in English and the other Germanic languages in which verbs are atelic in the lexicon, <ITALIC>MAX<SUB>E</SUB> </ITALIC>is grammaticalised in perfective verbs. On the assumption that <ITALIC>MAX<SUB>E</SUB> </ITALIC>is part of the logical structure of a perfective verb in Slavic, illustrated here with Polish, no linguistic or extra-linguistic material can be incompatible with the maximalisation requirement carried by the covert <ITALIC>MAX<SUB>E</SUB> </ITALIC>operator by perfective verbs. Thus, Filip takes a perfective incremental theme verb of consumption to constrain the interpretation of the incremental theme argument it combines with, as demonstrated in (52), where the object argument denotes the totality of the stuff or objects that fall under the denotation of the nominal predicate. In other words, (52) entails that the incremental theme object is totally affected (consumed) in the event described in (52).<sup>15</sup></p>
<p><sup>15</sup> The totality entailment with respect to the quantity of the incremental theme affected in an event described with an incremental theme verb holds only when the direct object is accusative-marked. Genitive case marking on the incremental theme argument is inconsistent with an incremental modifier (see Willim 2006:236, 238):</p>

<p>&#x2018;He ate (up) (all) the porridge/olives.&#x2019; (i.e., the whole quantity of porridge/olives)</p>
<p>[Polish]</p>
<p>According to Filip (2005, 2008), the totality interpretation is not an implicature, but an entailment. As expected in this scenario, the totality requirement on the interpretation of the incremental theme object cannot be cancelled without a con-tradiction:<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;Piotr ate porridge/olives gradually.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p><sup>16</sup>Given the acceptability of the example in (i) from a questionnaire by CBOS, the government-based polling agency, whether the totality interpretation of the incremental theme is a logical entailment rather than an implicature needs further investigation empirically supported with naturally-occurring data. To the extent that the lack of the totality interpretation of an incremental theme illustrated by (i) is supported by further data, this opens up the theoretical possibility that telicity may be an implicature rather than an entailment also in Polish, arising in the context of an incremental theme verb in the absence of a specified quantity of the incremental theme argument expressed with a lexical quantifier or a measure expression. In the latter case, overriding the totality interpretation in the context of a perfective verb encoding a contextually determined maximal event, as illustrated in (ii), can be expected to be preempted by the Gricean Maxim of Quantity.</p>

<p>In contrast to the perfective, the imperfective, being the unmarked category in the privative aspectual opposition, does not constrain the interpretation of the incremental theme&#x2019;s referential properties (cf. Filip 2005, 2008). As (55) demonstrates, the incremental theme can have indefinite or definite interpretation in the scope of the imperfective operator.</p>

<p>258</p>
<p>Importantly, perfectivity and telicity are not co-extensive. While the perfective (<ITALIC>MAX<SUB>E</SUB></ITALIC>) is a covert operator in the perfective verb, the prefix that marks the verb, which applied to a base imperfective verb typically yields a perfective verb (form) and is usually referred to as perfectivising, in fact contributes its own meaning to the base verb. Thus, while both (56a) and (56b) involve perfective verbs, in (56b) the prefix does not compose with the incremental theme, but rather modifies the temporal extent of the event. The predication in (56a) is perfective and telic at the same time, describing an event as having come to a culmination endpoint beyond which it cannot continue. By contrast, (56b) describes a terminated event, but not one that could not go on. Furthermore, while (56a) entails that the object has been affected in its totality, (56b) lacks this entailment.</p>
<list id="q_56" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(56)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">

<p>finish it.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>259</p>
<p>Also imperfectivity is not co-extensive with atelicity. Being the unmarked member of the aspectual opposition, the imperfective can generate a progressive interpretation, in which the reaching of the finishing endpoint of an event specifying an inherent culmination point is not entailed, similarly to the progressive in English, as shown in (57).</p>
<list id="q_57" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>&#x2018;Janek was crossing a/the street when a car hit him.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>However, the imperfective is also consistent with a telic interpretation in a telic presupposition context, that is a context in which the culmination of the event is presupposed rather than asserted, as shown in (58b).<sup>17</sup></p>

<p>In contrast to Polish, aspect is not grammaticalised in Hungarian, where regular processes marking grammatical aspect are absent, as noted, for example, in Kenesei et al. (1998). In Hungarian perfectivity can arise with some verbs due to the contribution of a stressed bare noun in the postverbal position. According to Kiefer (1994:448), the generalisation in (61) holds.<sup>18</sup></p>
<p><sup>18</sup>Furthermore, structures with indefinite objects obey a similar constraint, as shown in the example in (i), where one of the available readings is the reading that the perfective (ii) expresses (Kiefer 1994:450). Such ambiguity is not observed in Polish <italic>(pisa&#x0142;am list </italic>&#x2018;wrote-1SG.F letter-</p>

<p>According to Kardos (2012), Hungarian differs from English and other Germanic languages as well as from Polish and other Slavic languages in that it requires the presence of an explicit, overt event-bounding element for a bounded-/perfective/maximal event reading to arise. Apart from event-bounding preverbs, also resultative/locative predicates and quantised scalar measure/quantity expressions such as <italic>5 kilometers, 10 laps, </italic>etc., can act as event-bounders, as illustrated</p>

<p>As (63b) and (63c) demonstrate, both a preverb and a resultative predicate telicise the events that the sentences containing them describe. Atelicity arises in the absence of an overt event bounder. Kardos (2012) thus suggests for Hungarian that the overt event-bounders all contribute event maximalisation to the predicates with which they combine and as a result, an overtly bounded event has quantised reference and is telic. The sentence in (63a) is atelic as there is no over event bounder that could enforce event maximalisation. Notice that the indefinite article in the structure of the noun phrases linked to the incremental theme does not contribute to the maximalisation of the event in Hungarian, as (63a) shows, unlike in English, where both the atelic and the telic interpretation can arise in the</p>
<p>263</p>
<p>presence of an object with an indefinite article, as shown in (64). The sentence in (63a) also stands in contrast to Polish, as shown in (65), where a time-span adverbial is not inconsistent with the imperfective aspect of the verb, but in such a case, the sentence receives a habitual interpretation. Habitual events, having an unbounded plurality of individual events in their denotation, are atelic (cf. also (60)).</p>

<p>[Polish]</p>
<p>The only exception to the generalisation that event bounding requires the presence of an overt event bounder, such as an event-bounding preverb, resulta-tive/locative predicate, or a scalar DP, in Hungarian are creation and consumption predications, in which the telicity of the predication depends on the quantised reference of the incremental theme argument, as shown in (66) from Kardos</p>
<p>(2012:100).<sup>20</sup></p>
<p><sup>20</sup>Notice that (66) is similar to predications of this type in English, as shown in (44), which Hay et al. (1999) analyse as demonstrating that the telicity of predications with consumption and creation verbs is variable in English.</p>

<p>Wrapping up, what the data discussed here clearly show is that the three languages under study here differ in the strategies that they resort to for the purposes of encoding the difference between event boundedness and unboundedness and/or telicity/atelicity. In addition, the presence and the referential properties of the object do not have an equal role to play in aspectual composition not only across English, Polish, and Hungarian, but also within the individual languages. In the next section, I look into the interactions between <italic>aktionsarten, </italic>telicity, and grammatical aspect to see if any of these categories block object drop and to see if any of these categories may favour object drop. I also discuss some additional factors that may contribute to licensing object drop in the languages under study.</p>

<label>5.3.2</label>
<title>Interactions with object drop</title>
<p>The relevance of <italic>aktionsart, </italic>telicity, and grammatical aspect for object drop has not remained unnoticed in the literature. For example, reacting to Fraser &#x0026; Ross (1970:264), in which the acceptability of (67) is attributed to their idiomatic-ity, Browne (1971:256) provides the non-idiomatic but unacceptable examples in (68). He suggests that the relevant feature blocking the deletion of the object</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>is aspectual in that the verbs in (67) presuppose the completion of the action (e.g. the drink is completely gone in (67a) when the action denoted by the predicate is finished).<sup>21</sup></p>
<list id="q_67" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(67)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_67a"><label>a.</label><p>John drank &#x00F8; (*down). b. Fred wrote &#x00F8; (*off).</p>

<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_68a"><label>a.</label><p>*J. consumed/devoured &#x00F8;. b. *F. debited &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>In principle, both definite and indefinite objects can be dropped with telic and atelic predications in English:</p>
<p><sup>21</sup>Object drop with the verb <italic>drink </italic>is unavailable when the completion of the event is asserted, as illustrated in (i) from Mittwoch (1971:256).</p>
<p>(i) a. *He has just drunk (beer). b. He has just drunk the beer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the indefinite <italic>something </italic>can function as an object in the same context (Mittwoch 1971:257):</p>
<p>(ii) He has drunk something.</p>
<p>This shows that object drop does not correspond to the deletion of an indefinite and is consistent with the difference in the scopal potential of the missing object and the indefinite discussed in section 4.2 of chapter 4.</p>

<p>While a particle like <italic>down </italic>(or <italic>off </italic>) could be taken as telicising the events in sentences like (67), Mittwoch (1971) argues in reference to contexts with verbs like <italic>wash </italic>that the function of the particle <italic>up </italic>is to restrict the meaning of the verb rather than to encode the culmination point and trigger a telic interpretation, as</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>is usually the case with aspectual particles combining with verbs in English. In such cases, omitting the object is in general possible:<sup>22</sup></p>

<p>At the same time, completive particles (e.g. <italic>drink up, use up, </italic>and <italic>work out) </italic>have been noted in the literature to contribute to making the object prominent in the sentence by shifting attention to the result state of the event (see Garc&#x00ED;a Velasco &#x0026; Portero Mu&#x00F1;oz 2002) and for this reason to contribute to blocking object drop.

<p>Furthermore, as the data from English below show, <italic>aktionsart </italic>need not change with states, achievements, and accomplishments, including accomplishments with an incremental theme verb, regardless of whether the object is expressed or not. Object drop is not expected to affect the activity <italic>aktionsart</italic>, as (67b) above demonstrates.<sup>23</sup></p>

<list-item><label>(84)</label><p><italic>Accomplishment</italic></p>
<p>We&#x2019;ve already eaten (lunch).</p>
<p>However, object drop may result in a shift in the <italic>aktionsart </italic>of the predication.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup>Fora discussionofthe <italic>aktionsarten </italic>and some correlations with argument realisation options in the conative alternation in English, Polish, and Hungarian, see Beavers (2013), Willim (2006), and Kardos (2012) respectively.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>This can be diagnosed by the (in)compatibility of the complement predication with embedding under the predicate <italic>take x-time</italic>, which selects for a telic predication in its infinitival clause complement in English, as illustrated in (85). This is not so with predicates denoting activities in structures with missing objects, as in this case the addition of the object makes available also the accomplishment interpretation.</p>
<list id="q_85" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(85)</label><p>

<p>How long did it take him to read the short stories?</p>
<p>Based on data like (85), it has been noted in the literature that dropping an indefinite object can serve the purpose of shifting an accomplishment to an activity. Mittwoch (1982:114) illustrates this point with (86), where the presence of the indefinite <italic>something </italic>in object position gives rise to the accomplishment reading (see Resnik 1993; Garc&#x00ED;a Velasco &#x0026; Portero Mu&#x00F1;oz 2002; Croft 2012 for some related remarks).</p>
<list id="q_86" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>272</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>John is eating something.</p>
<p>This alternation holds in some contexts, but not in others, as revealed by (84), where the use of the perfect aspect in the present tense context constrains the interpretive options.</p>
<p>In Hungarian, argument realisation options are influenced by the presence of preverbs, which can shift an activity verb to an accomplishment with the perfective interpretation, as discussed in &#x00C9;. Kiss (2002) and references cited therein.<sup>24 </sup>For example, the verb <italic>olvas </italic>&#x2018;read&#x2019; can be combined with the preverbs <italic>el, &#x00E1;t, meg, r&#x00E1;, </italic>or <italic>be, </italic>which contribute their meaning to the meaning of the verb, ranging from signalising the notion of completion to non-compositional meanings <italic>(elolvas </italic>&#x2018;read, finish reading&#x2019;, <italic>&#x00E1;tolvas </italic>&#x2018;read through, skim&#x2019;, <italic>megolvas </italic>&#x2018;count (money)&#x2019;, <italic>r&#x00E1;olvas </italic>&#x2018;heal by words&#x2019;, <italic>beolvas </italic>&#x2018;tell off). This lexical aspectual difference manifests itself, for example, in the types of temporal adverbials with which the verbs can combine, as (87) from &#x00C9;. Kiss (2002:62-63) illustrates.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup> When in the preverbal position, preverbs are spelled as one word with the verb by convention, as illustrated, for example, in (87) in the main text. However, they are postverbal in contexts with focused elements or negation and can be separated from the verb, as (i) from &#x00C9;. Kiss (2002:57) shows.</p>
<p>(i)	P&#x00E9;ter nemolvasta&#x0151;ket fel.</p>

<p>The influence of preverbs on the argument realisation options in comparison with the basic verb <italic>olvas </italic>&#x2018;read&#x2019; relates to the obligatoriness of the internal argument and to the value of its case. Even though <italic>olvas </italic>&#x2018;read&#x2019; can be used in the structure with unspecified object drop, <italic>elolvas </italic>&#x2018;read, finish reading&#x2019;, <italic>&#x00E1;tolvas </italic>&#x2018;read through, skim&#x2019;, and <italic>megolvas </italic>&#x2018;count (money)&#x2019; require overt accusative objects, <italic>r&#x00E1;olvas </italic>&#x2018;heal by words&#x2019; requires a sublative object, and <italic>beolvas </italic>&#x2018;tell off&#x2019; a dative one (&#x00C9;. Kiss 2002:56). Interestingly, <italic>felolvas </italic>&#x2018;read aloud&#x2019;, which retains the argument realisation options of <italic>olvas </italic>&#x2018;read&#x2019; and can appear with an accusative object or in the structure with object drop, is also the only one which can be interpreted as an activity rather than only as an accomplishment (&#x00C9;.

For example, even though the activity verb <italic>p&#x0142;aka&#x0107; </italic>&#x2018;cry&#x2019; is intransitive, it becomes a transitive accomplishment when prefixed with the perfectivising prefix <italic>wy-</italic>:</p>

<p>The ways in which object drop interacts with grammatical aspect are likewise complex. In principle, objects can be dropped with the perfective and imperfec-tive aspect in all three languages discussed here. As (90) and (91) illustrate for English, missing objects with the verb <italic>call</italic>, which licenses definite object drop, and the verb <italic>cook</italic>, which licenses indefinite object drop, are compatible with the</p>
<p>perfective and the imperfective aspect.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p><sup>25</sup>In a diachronic study of English, Lavidas (2013) tests the hypothesis that the availability of null objects is related to the grammaticalisation of the progressive/non-progressive aspect distinction. The suggested correlation between the availability of null objects and viewpoint aspect is not supported by the data. See Giannakidou &#x0026; Merchant (1997); Tsimpli &#x0026; Papadopoulou (2006) for some relevant discussions of Greek.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as noted also in section 5.4 below, experiential perfect belongs to the set of factors licensing object drop in English. The examples in (92)&#x2013;(93) from Ruppenhofer (2004:373) provide an illustration.</p>

<p>As further noted in Kiefer (2006:46), some perfective verbs in the indefinite conjugation (e.g. <italic>megetet </italic>&#x2018;Pv-feed&#x2019;, <italic>megf&#x0151;z </italic>&#x2018;Pv-cook&#x2019;) make object drop possible in Hungarian, but not all (e.g. <italic>meg&#x00ED;r </italic>&#x2018;Pv-write&#x2019;, <italic>elolvas </italic>&#x2018;Pv-read&#x2019;).<sup>26</sup> The examples</p>
<p><sup>26</sup>N&#x00E9;meth T. (2008) notes that verbs which can be used with missing objects in this context include also <italic>kimos </italic>&#x2018;PV-wash&#x2019;, <italic>kivasal </italic>&#x2018;PV-iron&#x2019;, <italic>elmosogat </italic>&#x2018;PV-wash (do the washing up)&#x2019;, <italic>ki-takar&#x00ED;t </italic>&#x2018;PV-tidy&#x2019;, <italic>learat </italic>&#x2018;PV-reap&#x2019;, even though Kiefer (2006:46) lists <italic>kimos </italic>&#x2018;PV-wash&#x2019; among the verbs which cannot drop objects. As Professor Istv&#x00E1;n Kenesei informs me, verbs belonging to the same semantic class can behave differently in this respect. For example, housework verbs such as<italic>fel-szeletel </italic>&#x2018;pv-slice, slice up (meat)&#x2019;, <italic>le-szed </italic>&#x2018;pv-take, take off (dishes from tables)&#x2019;, and <italic>meg-ter&#x00ED;t </italic>&#x2018;PV-lay (the table)&#x2019; make object drop available, but <italic>meg-h&#x00E1;moz </italic>&#x2018;PV-peel, peel off (apples, potatoes)&#x2019; and <italic>fel-akaszt </italic>&#x2018;PV-hang, hang up (pictures on a wall)&#x2019; do not. Pending further inquiry, Kiefer (2006) suggests that the difference between the verbs might be attributable to institutionalisation.</p>
<p>Kiefer (2006:47) observes that perfective verbs which make object drop of this type possible can also be used in the present tense to describe on-going present situations:</p>
<p>(i)	A: Mit csin&#x00E1;lsz?</p>
<p>whatdo-2sG &#x2018;What are you doing?&#x2019; B: Felmosok	&#x00F8;./Kitakar&#x00ED;tok</p>
<p>PV-mop-1SG.INDEF PV-clean-1SG.INDEF</p>
<p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;mmopping./I&#x2019;m cleaning.&#x2019;	[Hungarian]</p>
<p>277</p>
<p>in (96) illustrate this difference.<sup>27</sup></p>
<list id="q_96" list-type="simple" list-content="example">

<p>These sentences constitute an interesting contrast not only with each other, but also with parallel sentences in Polish, where both verbs make object drop available in this context:</p>

<p>The difference between Hungarian and Polish observed in (96)-(97) could follow from more general, aspect-related differences between these languages, whose</p>
<p><sup>27</sup>I would like to thank Gr&#x00E9;te Dalmi for the judgment.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p>exact analysis requires further research.</p>
<p>In Polish, perfective aspect is also compatible with non-anaphoric object drop in sentences interpreted habitually (Bu&#x0142;at 2004:163):<sup>28</sup></p>
<list id="q_98" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(98)</label><p>Tomekto dobry ch&#x0142;opak: (zawsze) naprawi &#x00F8;, TomekPREDgood boy	always <sc>pref-</sc>fix<sc>-</sc>3<sc>sg</sc></p>

<p>[Polish]</p>
<p>This combination of habituality and perfectivity makes it possible to see how such features of the sentence can influence the interpretation of a missing object. The examples in (99) constitute interesting contexts.</p>
<p><sup>28</sup>The licensing of anaphoric object drop by habituality coupled with a perfective verb is also attested in the corpus:</p>

<p>PREF-growl-3SG</p>
<p>&#x2018;This is a good dog, it will never bite anyone (or growl)/it never bites (or growls).&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>The sentence in (99a), where the verb is imperfective and the object is unspecified (by default, it is interpreted as people in general), involves the characteristic property of the agent alternation, which I have discussed in section 4.2.4 of chapter 4. The variant in (99c), where perfective aspect is combined with habituality can be interpreted similarly to (99a), or it can also have the future meaning, perfective aspect combined with a non-past verbal form giving rise to future interpretation in Polish. Here the object is also interpreted as unspecified. On the other hand, when the verb is perfective in the absence of habituality, the object is most readily interpreted with reference to contextually-salient individuals, such as the hearer. The sentence in (99b) could be an appropriate continuation for <italic>Nie b&#x00F3;j si&#x0119;, ... </italic>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t be afraid,...&#x2019;, assuring the hearer that she/he feels safe. Interestingly, the</p>
<p>280</p>
<p>positive polarity variant of (99b) is not well-formed:</p>
<list id="q_100" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(100)</label><p>Uwa&#x017C;aj! *Ten pies ugryzie be.careful this dog PR<SUB>EF</SUB>-bite-3sG</p>
<p>&#x2018;Be careful! This dog will bite you.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>The crucial role of negation in this case suggests that (99b) may in fact be interpreted similarly to (99c), with the interpretation of the object as referring to the hearer (for example) being inferred on the basis of situational context. The sentence in (99c) is unnatural, if acceptable, in the absence of negation:<sup>29</sup></p>
<list id="q_101" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(101)</label><p>?*To okropny pies, zawsze ugryzie	&#x00F8;(i zawarczy).</p>
<p>PRED horrible dog always PR<SUB>EF</SUB>-bite-3sG and PREF-growl-3sG &#x2018;This is a terrible dog, it will always bite people (and growl)/it al ways bites (and growls).&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>A natural way to express (101) is by using the imperfective verbs <italic>gryzie </italic>&#x2018;bite-3SG&#x2019; and <italic>warczy </italic>&#x2018;growl-3s<SUB>G</SUB>&#x2019;, which can also be used in (99c).</p>
<p>The opposite situation with respect to the polarity-related distinction is also observed. In particular, non-anaphoric object drop with a perfective verb is available in Polish also in the presence of the light verb <italic>lubi&#x0107; </italic>&#x2018;like&#x2019; and modality introduced, for example, by <italic>wiedzie&#x0107;jak </italic>&#x2018;know how&#x2019; or by the modal verb <italic>potrafi&#x0107;</italic></p>
<p><sup>29</sup>One speaker reports that (101) is as unacceptable as (100) to him.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p>&#x2018;can&#x2019;:</p>
<list id="q_102" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(102)</label><p>

<p>c.	Ten pies potrafi ugry&#x017A;&#x0107; &#x00F8;. this dog can PREF-bite</p>
<p>&#x2018;This dog can bite/This dog sometimes bites.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>As descriptions of the dog, these sentences need to be positive in polarity. For example, adding negation to (102c) cannot yield the interpretation that <italic>This dog never bites </italic>has. Since the intricacies of the interaction of modality, aspect, and negation are beyond the scope of this work and remain the same beyond the domain of missing objects (cf., e.g., <italic>Tu potrafi pada&#x0107; przez trzy dni z rz&#x0119;du </italic>&#x2018;It can rain here three days in a row&#x2019; and <italic>*Tu nie potrafi pada&#x0107; przez trzy dni z rz&#x0119;du </italic>&#x2018;It can&#x2019;t rain here three days in a row&#x2019;), I do not discuss them further here.<sup>30</sup></p>
<p><sup>30</sup>Another relevant contrast observed in Hungarian has been brought to my attention by Professor Istv&#x00E1;n Kenesei: whereas in the modal context in (ia) object drop is unacceptable, replacing modal inflection on the verb with the equivalent modal auxiliary makes it acceptable (see (ib)).</p>
<p>(i)	a. *Ez a kutyanemharap-hat.</p>
<p>this the dog not bite-MODALITY</p>
<p>&#x2018;This dog cannot bite.&#x2019; b. Ez a kutyanemtud harap-ni. this the dog not ablebite-iNF &#x2018;This dog cannot bite.&#x2019;	[Hungarian]</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>In sum, the discussion above has shown that object drop is not determined directly by telicity, <italic>aktionsart, </italic>or aspect, as missing objects can in principle appear in predications and sentences belonging to any of the categories distinguished within these classifications. The way in which these categories can influence ob-ject drop calls for a more detailed analysis focusing not only on different types of verbal predicates, but also concerned with the distribution and interpretation of object drop with individual verbs. This is a complex issue, which falls well beyond the scope of this work. However, since object drop is licensed across all the categories of <italic>aktionsarten </italic>and aspect in English, Polish, and Hungarian, an analysis of the syntax of missing objects is needed which takes into account the definite/indefinite and anaphoric/non-anaphoric contrast independently of the issues associated with <italic>aktionsarten </italic>and aspect and which can model the interpretive differences. The details of the model offered here have been presented mainly in chapters 2 and 3 of part 1. In the next section, I add further to the description of the contexts that interact with missing objects by focusing on factors that can influence object drop at the sentence level (IP/CP), as well as in larger situational contexts.</p>
<p>The affirmative counterpart of (ia) is acceptable:</p>
<p>(ii) Ez a kutyaharap/harap-hat.</p>
<p>this the dog bites bite-MODALiTY</p>

<title>Licensing of missing objects by syntactic and information-structural environment</title>
<p>Object drop may be influenced by elements that enter the syntactic derivation of a sentence after the merger of VP (verb and its arguments) and any VP-adverbials. The following examples illustrate contexts favouring object drop described previously in the literature about English:<sup>31</sup></p>
<p>&#x2022;	Habituality, genericity, iterativity (Resnik 1993:78; Goldberg 2001:507; Ruppenhofer 2004:374)</p>

<p>As expected, the object is indefinite with habitual and modal meanings. This facilitates an analysis on which the internal argument variable can be unselectively bound by clausal operators. Contrast and emphasis on the action are available in episodic construals, making possible definite interpretation of the object. Furthermore, (119) and (121) show that emphasis on the action denoted by the verb can license both non-anaphoric and anaphoric object drop with the same verb. Further sentential context determines the ultimate interpretation of the missing object. Similar effects arise in sequences of verbs or clauses, as the following examples show. In (122) the object is non-anaphoric and its interpretation relies on the canonical associations triggered by particular verbs. In (123) the content of the missing object is recovered from an overt object introduced earlier in the sentence, that is <italic>ideas</italic>.</p>

<p>Since verb and clause sequences do not impose their own restrictions on the interpretation of the object, the reading of the object is determined by other factors. This shows that the mechanisms of licensing object drop do not necessarily correlate with the anaphoricity or definiteness of the missing object.</p>
<p>The sections which follow provide some additional discussion of some of these contexts. Section 5.4.1 is concerned with habituality, genericity, and iter-ativity, whereas section 5.4.2 focuses on contrast, emphasis on the action, verb sequences, and stress on an element other than the object.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2>
<label>5.4.1</label>
<title>Habituality, genericity, iterativity</title>
<p>Genericity and habituality are important factors licensing object drop, as illustrated by the availability of a missing object denoting indeterminate people in</p>
<list id="q_124" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(124)</label><p>and things in (125) from Fraser &#x0026; Ross (1970:264).<sup>32</sup></p>
<p><sup>32</sup>It seems that habituality is not always enough to license object drop, as suggested by the following examples from Goldberg (2001:512):</p>
<p>(i) a. That man always recycles &#x00F8;. b. *That man always breaks &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>289</p>
<list id="q_124" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(124)</label><p>Cecil rapes (murders, etc.) &#x00F8;.</p>
<list id="q_125" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(125)</label><p>Max steals (sells, etc.) &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>In contrast to missing objects of verbs such as <italic>read, </italic>missing objects of verbs such as <italic>rape </italic>and <italic>steal </italic>are unavailable in the progressive when episodic reading is enforced, illustrating that habituality is indeed a licensing factor (cf. (124) and (126) from Fraser &#x0026; Ross 1970:264).</p>
<list id="q_126" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(126)</label><p>*Cecil was raping &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>As noted in Mittwoch (2005:244), some verbs which license unspecified missing objects are used in the habitual context with a somewhat different meaning than when used in episodic contexts. For example, a sentence such as <italic>He is writing &#x00F8; </italic>refers to making marks with a pen, etc., whereas the habitual <italic>He writes &#x00F8; </italic>can be true even if used with reference to the process of dictating into a tape recorder.</p>
<p>Missing objects in generic sentences, shown in (127) from Goldberg (2001:506), are non-referential, as expected due to the non-referential uses of the tenses involved.<sup>33</sup></p>
<p>Goldberg suggests that the two sentences are distinguished by the richness of the lexical meaning of the verbs.</p>
<p><sup>33</sup> See also Cummins &#x0026; Roberge (2004) for a note on the correlation between the referentiality</p>
<p>290</p>
<list id="q_127" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(127)</label><p>Tigers only kill &#x00F8; at night.</p>
<p>(cf. The tiger killed *(some animal).)</p>
<p>As revealed by the following Polish example from Karolak (1984:111), in-formativity of a sentence is also relevant to the degree to which it is judged as acceptable:</p>
<list id="q_128" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(128)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_128a"><label>a.</label><p>Doktor Bielski leczy &#x00F8; akupunktur&#x0105;.</p>
<p>doctor Bielski treats acupuncture-iNST* &#x2018;Doctor Bielski treats with acupuncture.&#x2019;</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>??DoktorBielski leczy &#x00F8;. doctor Bielski treats &#x2018;Doctor Bielski treats.&#x2019;	[Polish]</p>
<p>The effect of the specification of the method in (129a) is similar to what has been observed with respect to the construction expressing a characteristic property of an instrument (cf. <italic>*Thispen writes </italic>and <italic>This pen writes well; </italic>see section 4.2.5 of chapter 4).</p>
<p>An additional interesting fact related to the example in (128) is that the non-anaphoric object here is ambiguous between indeterminate people and indeterminate medical problems. This is a result of the selectional properties of the verb <italic>leczy&#x0107; </italic>&#x2018;treat&#x2019;, which can take an accusative object of either type:</p>
<p>of objects and tenses.</p>
<p>291</p>
<list id="q_129" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(129)</label><p>Doktor Bielski leczy diabetyk&#x00F3;w/ cukrzyc&#x0119; doctor Bielski treats diabetics-Ace diabetis-Acc (akupunktur&#x0105;).</p>
<p>acupuncture-iNs&#x2122; &#x2018;Doctor Bielski treats diabetics/diabetes (with acupuncture).&#x2019;[Polish]</p>
<p>Ambiguity remains unresolved in (128), but this does not affect the acceptability of the sentence. The informative focus is on the method or instrument. Unresolved ambiguity in fact leads to the inference that all kinds of diseases can be treated with the specified method.</p>
</sec2>
<sec2>
<label>5.4.2</label>
<title>Contrast, emphasis on the action, verb sequences, and stress on an element other than the object</title>
<p>Contrast can license object drop (Resnik 1993:78):</p>
<list id="q_130" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(130)</label><p><italic>Driver to police officer: </italic>If I give you &#x0024;50, will you ignore this</p>
<p>traffic violation? <italic>Police officer to driver: </italic>You pay &#x00F8;, I&#x2019;ll ignore &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>Just as is the case with non-anaphoric missing objects, discussed in section 4.2 of chapter 4, also with anaphoric object drop licensed by contrast stereotypical associations evoked by specific verbs can have effects on interpretation. For example, the fact that the null object of the verb <italic>wash </italic>usually refers to <italic>dishes</italic></p>
<p>292</p>
<p>triggers a humorous effect in (131) from Cote (1996:151).</p>
<list id="q_131" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(131)</label><p>The baby needs a bath&#x2014;you wash &#x00F8; and I&#x2019;ll dry &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>As noted in Mittwoch (2005:250), the necessary contrast can be contributed by an extra-linguistic situation, as in (132), uttered by a person who sees someone cutting an article out of a newspaper.</p>
<list id="q_132" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(132)</label><p>I always TEAR &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>Pragmatic focus on the activity can also contribute to licensing object drop, as discussed in Rice (1988:206) and Goldberg (2001:513) in relation to the following examples:</p>
<list id="q_133" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(133)</label><p>Martha cooked &#x00F8; and cleaned &#x00F8; while Mary entertained &#x00F8;.</p>
<list id="q_134" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(134)</label><p>He was always opposed to the idea of murder, but in the middle of battlefield, he had no trouble killing &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>To capture the effect of emphasising the prominence of action on object drop, Goldberg (2001:514) offers the following generalisation:</p>
<p>293</p>
<list id="q_135" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(135)</label><p><italic>Omission under Low Discourse Prominence</italic></p>
<p>Omission of the Patient argument is possible when the Patient argument is construed to be deemphasized in the discourse vis a vis the action. That is, omission is possible when the Patient argument is not topical (or focal) in the discourse, and the action is particularly emphasized (via repetition, strong affective stance, discourse topicality, contrastive focus, etc.).</p>
<p>Yet, the examples in (136) show that it need not necessarily be the action that is emphasised, but any element other than the object. According to Allerton (1975:235), when something other that the antecedent NP receives main sentence stress, object drop can be favoured over overt realisation of the object. An overt pronoun is felt as less natural when the antecedent is pronominalised (cf. (136b) and (136c)).</p>
<list id="q_136" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(136)</label><p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item id="q_136a"><label>a.</label><p>When BILL took the exam, he passed &#x00F8;.</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>When BILL took the exam, he passed it.</p>
<p>c.	When BILL took it, he passed it.</p>
<p>When the missing object is anaphoric, as in (137), its antecedent must be salient enough in discourse (Cote 1996:144):</p>
<p>294</p>
<list id="q_137" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(137)</label><p>Bert pushed &#x00F8; and Ernie pulled &#x00F8; to get the door open.</p>
<list id="q_138" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(138)</label><p>A: I wonder what Bert and Ernie are up to now?</p>
<p>B: Oh, there in the other room. &#x0023;Bert&#x2019;s pushing &#x00F8; and Ernie&#x2019;s pulling &#x00F8;.</p>
<p>Verb sequences can have the same effect, as illustrated in (111) above, repeated here in (139). However, the degree to which speakers find structures of this type acceptable has been reported to be subject to inter-speaker variation. In particular, Lavidas (2013:73), observes that some native speakers accept examples such as (140), but others find them degraded, even up to unacceptability.<sup>34</sup></p>

<title>Conclusion and outlook</title>
<p>Even though not unnoticed, special contexts licensing object drop have not played a major role in analyses of the syntax of missing objects. However, since object drop licensed by special environments is robustly represented in the data with missing objects, marginalising it in theoretical accounts seems unwarranted. The impact which the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic context can have on licensing object drop should be treated as a serious indicator of the type of analysis which object drop should be given, especially when aiming for a unified analysis of contexts with object drop. Even if a unified analysis is not the goal, the acceptability of the structures with missing objects presented throughout this chapter still requires some explanation.</p>
<p>The discussion in this and the preceding chapter makes clear that both non-anaphoric and anaphoric indefinite and definite missing objects are available in English, Polish, and Hungarian at least in some contexts. The data support the analysis of at least some restrictions on the use of missing objects in English in terms of constraints imposed by an interaction of components of meaning rather than mechanisms as strict as lexical encoding of object omission. Interestingly, interpretive factors play a role not only for object drop, but also for the causative-inchoative alternation. As noticed by Wechsler (2015:80&#x2013;81), even though the</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>verb <italic>decapitate </italic>is not usually licensed in the inchoative frame (see (141a)), when the event described can be construed as spontaneous, the structure becomes acceptable (see (141b)). This leads Wechsler (2015) to conclude that the verb <italic>decapitate </italic>is not lexically specified as transitive, but rather its inchoative use is constrained by a spontaneity condition on interpretation.</p>
<list id="q_141" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(141)</label><p>

<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Packed with 70+ minutes of songs about bunnies, squid, aard-varks, and classmates, this collection is certain to make you wish you could spontaneously decapitate.</p>
<p>I advocate the same line of reasoning with respect to the contexts of object drop in which interpretive factors license the missing object and the particular type of interpretation with which this object can be associated. More generally, data of the type as in (141), in combination with the data with object drop discussed here, suggest that there might be a general problem with enforcing uses of verbs with a particular number of overt arguments by rigid lexical specifications.</p>
<p>In part 1 of this work, I have presented some further facts concerning the issues relevant here, based on native-speaker judgments of some additional examples. The key factor on which I have focused in the theoretical analysis in part</p>
<p>297</p>
<p>1 is the grammatical representation of indefinite and definite missing objects in English, Polish, and Hungarian, which can form a basis for a theoretical approach to variation found cross-linguistically and intra-linguistically, including the contexts discussed in this and the preceding chapter.</p>

<title>Conclusions and extensions</title>

</book-part-meta>
<body>
<p>In part 1 of this book, I have offered an analysis on which missing objects are present in the syntactic structure, where they are represented minimally as the nominalising categorial head <italic>n </italic>and maximally contain all interpretable heads composing overt pronominals in a language. In part 2, I have presented a broader empirical picture of missing objects, focusing on data from English, Polish, and Hungarian. Previous descriptions of the phenomenon, supplemented with some novel data gathered from corpora and from native speakers, can serve as the basis for further theoretical discussion.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I consider some additional issues related to the analysis offered in chapters 1&#x2013;3. I briefly revise some key points of the analysis in section 6.1, outlining how it can be employed to approach the issue of language vari-</p>
<p>ation in the domain of argument drop, including the problem of intra-linguistic variation (section 6.1.1). This encompasses both register-related variation and variation conditioned by special linguistic and extra-linguistic contexts which can license object drop, such as the experiential perfect in English. I suggest that variation of these types might be best analysed as involving an extension of mechanisms already present in the grammar of a language, rather than as constituting, for example, a case of parameter resetting. I then provide some suggestions about the ways in which the analysis bears on the problem of language acquisition in section 6.2, outlining the predictions which it makes for the acquisition path of structures with missing objects.</p>

<p>Table 6.1: Missing objects in English, Polish, and Hungarian</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>I have developed this system based on the observation that indefinite missing objects behave similarly in the three languages analysed here, in contrast to definite missing objects. The proposal to analyse indefinite missing objects as represented syntactically as <italic>n </italic>does not require additional mechanisms bypassing selectional restrictions of verbs, including postulating vast lexical ambiguity or detransitivisation operations. As the <italic>n </italic>head can be taken to be available in any language which has nouns, no special lexical item needs to be postulated on the current account. Similarly, Restrict (or any alternative operation employed for interpretation of mass nouns) is available in English, Polish, and Hungarian, as evidenced by their ability to interpret structures containing mass nouns, and is possibly available in any natural language (Chierchia 1994). In conjunction with the postulated denotation <italic>ofn </italic>as shown in (1), this approach can successfully model indefinite missing objects, accounting for the similarity in scopal behaviour between them and mass nouns and bare plurals by taking all of them to be projected syntactically and to be interpreted via the same mechanism.</p>

<p>301</p>
<p>I have shown that indefinite missing objects present a more complicated picture as far as their availability to participate in control is concerned than what has been suggested in the previous literature. Most importantly from the present perspective, the complexities observed even in the preliminary set of data provided in section 2.4 of chapter 2 suggest that treating the (un)availability of control with a missing object as a straightforward test for the syntactic projection of the object might be flawed, as it underappreciates the complexity of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>The investigation of indefinite missing objects in the context of the influence of the manner component of verb meaning on object drop has lead to the generalisation put forth in section 1.2 of chapter 1 and repeated below as (2).</p>
<list id="q_2" list-type="simple" list-content="example">
<list-item><label>(2)</label><p><italic>Manner specification generalisation	</italic>[parametrisable]</p>
<p>If a verb makes object drop available, its near synonym with a more specific manner component tends to block it.</p>
<p>The effects of rich manner specification on grammatical phenomena extend beyond the contexts with missing objects and are observed also with extraction and <italic>that </italic>deletion, with the contrast pertaining to verbs of speaking and verbs of manner of speaking (see section 2.3 of chapter 2). These data seem amenable to a pragmatic explanation (cf. Erterschik-Shir 1977).</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>In comparison with overt pronouns, definite missing objects are more flexible with respect to their interpretation in English and Polish, but not in Hungarian. I have used this as an argument supporting a representational difference between definite missing objects and overt pronouns in English and Polish. By contrast, all interpretable heads which I have postulated for overt pronouns in Hungarian are also included in the projection of definite missing objects. The structural representation which I have proposed for definite missing objects in Hungarian has made available a morphological explanation of the intriguing asymmetries of object drop patterns in this language, where in third person, only singular objects can be dropped, while in first and second person, dropping a plural object is acceptable. Building on the analysis of morphological realisation of heads in the projection of pronouns, I have reanalysed the unacceptability of dropping third-person plural objects as a result of the lack of a host for the plural marker <italic>-k </italic>to attach to. As first and second person pronouns have an analysis on which the Num head moves to Pers, the blocking factor constituted by the need to realise the Num head at the SM interface does not apply. This proposal has an advantage over previous analyses of Hungarian based on the notion of the semantic recov-erability of the number feature from verbal inflection (see Farkas &#x0026; de Swart 2003; &#x00C9;. Kiss 2012), as these analyses cannot account for at least three types of facts: the availability of plural object drop in first and second person, the lack of</p>
<p>303</p>
<p>the need for the person feature to be recoverable from verbal morphology, and the availability of object drop in structures which do not bear any object-related verbal marking.</p>
<p>As the nominalising head in English needs not be associated with phonemic features, the non-pronunciation of an object represented as <italic>n </italic>follows without additional assumptions. The restricted availability of <italic>n </italic>in definite contexts follows from the lexically-restricted availability of <italic>&#x03B9;</italic>. In Polish, where <italic>n </italic>contains the gender feature, the lack of phonemic realisation of an object represented as <italic>n </italic>is a result of the lack of number and case specification of the object, since gender can only be realised overtly within the fusional gender/number/case morpheme. I have hypothesised that the restrictions on the use of definite object drop in Polish follow from the preference for the use of overt pronominals, which are fully specified for &#x03C6; features.</p>
<p>In addition to capturing the data with object drop in the separate languages investigated here, a major theoretical interest of the approach developed in part 1 of this book lies in its potential to account for language similarity and language variation. Taking <italic>n </italic>to be available in the lexicons of all languages (with the category noun), within the system developed here, one way in which (agreement-unrelated) definite object drop, and by extension also subject drop, can be blocked in a language is if the language makes definite interpretations available only</p>
<p>304</p>
<p>via mediation by an overt lexical item, rather than allowing for an argument to be type shifted in the semantics by the <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>operation. Another potential blocking factor is the association of <italic>n </italic>(and other nominal heads) with phonemic features. Languages which lack the category D (and hence can apply <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>to interpret noun phrases) and which have a zero-realised <italic>n </italic>head should make argument drop widely available, subject perhaps only to pragmatic/discourse principles and competition from overt pronominals. Even though more research is needed to test this prediction, it seems that this is the case in the so-called radical <italic>p ro -</italic>drop languages such as Mandarin and Japanese. For example, Tomioka (2003) suggests that there is a dependency between the availability of bare nouns in argument positions and null arguments in Japanese, both of which can be interpreted via <italic>&#x03B9;</italic>. As there is no indication of <italic>n </italic>in Japanese (or Mandarin) being necessarily specified for phonemic features, the data can be accommodated within the current proposal along the lines suggested here. On the other hand, when a language has a zero-realised <italic>n </italic>but has articles whose presence blocks the application of <italic>&#x03B9;</italic>, merging an <italic>n </italic>in an argument position generally cannot result in a referential null argument. Furthermore, also the way in which the final interpretation of a type-shifted <italic>n </italic>is achieved and the type of discourse contexts where it is appropriate can be subject to cross-linguistic variation. For example, despite being widely available, missing objects in Mandarin cannot be referentially dependent on the subject of</p>
<p>305</p>
<p>the matrix clause, as shown in (3) from Huang (1984:537).</p>

<p>Variation in this respect can depend on more general properties of the domain of nominal interpretation in a language, perhaps along the distinction between subject-prominent and topic-prominent languages (see Li &#x0026; Thompson 1976) or the more general distinction between sentence-oriented and discourse-oriented languages from Tsao (1977), as assumed in the discussion of null arguments in Huang (1984). Restrictions of this type will need to be encoded as constraints on what sorts of dependencies <italic>n </italic>can and must enter to be interpreted.</p>

<title>Intra-linguistic variation</title>
<p>Different types of intra-linguistic variation are associated with missing objects. One type of variation which has received some amount of attention in the literature is related to registers and another is constituted by special grammatical environments which can make object drop available even in register-unmarked contexts. The former type of variation has been discussed for English in the context of the recipe register, which makes definite missing objects freely available,</p>
<p>306</p>
<p>as shown in (4).<sup>1</sup> The latter factor has been discussed in terms of the licensing conditions on object drop, such as the experiential perfect in English, as demonstrated in (5) (see chapter 5).</p>

<p>A question that arises is how this type of variation can be accommodated within grammatical theory.</p>
<p>In the light of the analysis of object drop presented in chapters 1&#x2013;3, I suggest that the patterns observed in (4)&#x2013;(5) are extensions of the mechanisms available elsewhere in the language. More specifically, definite object drop in the recipe context employs the same mechanism as definite object drop with verbs such as <italic>call </italic>and <italic>visit </italic>(see chapter 3). On this approach the objects in (4) are represented</p>
<p>as <italic>n </italic>and are interpreted with the application of <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>(see Ruda 2014b). If this is</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>For discussions see Haegeman (1987a,b); Massam &#x0026; Roberge (1989); Cote (1996); Culy (1996); Bender (1999); Ruppenhofer (2005); Ruppenhofer &#x0026; Michaelis (2010); Ruda (2014b).</p>
<p>307</p>
<p>correct, the only assumption which has to be made to account for object drop of this type is that the relevant registers extend the availability of <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>beyond the lexically-determined context and make it available for interpretation of objects of any verb used within the relevant registers.</p>
<p>Similarly, the null hypothesis concerning special licensing environments is that these structures employ the same mechanism as the structures with object drop available more freely. The object in (5b) is indefinite, which suggests a parallel with object drop observed with verbs such as <italic>read </italic>and <italic>eat</italic>. This means that also here the object is represented as <italic>n</italic>, but this time it can be interpreted, for example, via Restrict. If this is correct, the reason why Restrict is made available by experiential perfect, but cannot be applied in (5a) can be speculated to follow from the semantics of the progressive. If the progressive operator requires a predicate with stages in the input, the object is required to calculate the progress of the event of killing (which the progressive operator could pick). In (5b) the contribution of the perfective frame to the calculation of event completion rescues the structure from failing to be interpreted at the C-I interface.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>extend to other cases of variation found within languages, where, for example,</p>

<title>Missing objects and language acquisition</title>
<p>Comparative linguistic research has an important role to play in informing theories of language acquisition.<sup>3</sup> The three languages which have been the focus here provide an interesting ground for research in this area, as all of them make object drop possible in certain environments, but object drop is not completely unconstrained in any of them. This means that the primary linguistic data include structures with missing objects, but the language acquirer does not generalise from these data that object drop is free or that it is regulated by different features of the grammar than the ones which govern the availability of object drop in the adult language. Determining the features of the grammar which impose restrictions on object drop in different languages is thus a necessary step in developing a theory of how the acquisition of the relevant patterns is achieved.</p>
<p>The analysis of missing objects developed in part 1 makes some clear predictions for acquisitional studies.<sup>4</sup> In particular, taking the nominalising head <italic>n </italic>and</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>I thank Jeffrey Lidz for a discussion of issues raised in this section.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>An interesting attempt to reconcile the parametric theory of linguistic variation with the minimalist approach to the study of language has been suggested in Roberts (2012) and further developed in Biberauer &#x0026; Roberts (2012:269). In brief, they suggest that language acquisition proceeds down the path of the parametric hierarchy quoted in (i).</p>
<p>309</p>
<p>the operation <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>to be present in the initial state of the grammar, the way in which the acquisition of patterns with definite object drop in a language is achieved is predicted to be delimited by the features of the grammar related to the association of <italic>n </italic>with additional features (e.g. gender) and with phonemic content, and to the availability of <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>in the semantics or the association of shifting predicates to individuals with overt lexical items (articles). If <italic>n</italic>, <italic>&#x03B9;</italic>, and Restrict are present in the initial state (or, perhaps <italic>n </italic>is available as soon as the category noun is acquired), both indefinite and definite missing objects should be attested in child language, as has indeed been shown to be the case.</p>
<p>Even though more studies of child English focus on subject than object drop (see, e.g., Hyams &#x0026; Wexler 1993; Wang, Lillo-Martin, Best &#x0026; Levit 1992 and references cited therein), the acquisitional studies of object drop reported in P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux et al. (2008) and P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux et al. (2013) show that even children ac-</p>

<list-item id="q_a"><label>a.</label><p>Macroparameters: all heads of the relevant type share <italic>v<sub>i</sub></italic>;</p>
<list-item id="q_b"><label>b.</label><p>Mesoparameters: all functional heads of a given category (e.g. all verbal heads, all nominal heads, all &#x03C6;-bearing heads or all finite Cs) share <italic>v<sub>i</sub></italic>;</p>
<p>c.	Microparameters: a small subclass of functional heads (e.g. auxiliaries, pro nouns) share <italic>v<sub>i</sub></italic>;</p>
<p>d.	Nanoparameters: one or more idiosyncratic lexical items are specified for <italic>v<sub>i</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>Considering this proposal in the light of studies on object drop and its broader theoretical consequences in detail is beyond the present scope. However, the complexity of factors influencing the availability of object drop suggests that it may be better explained as a function of various interacting components of the grammar, rather than as a parametric option making special reference to null arguments. Whether these independent features of the grammar should be encoded as parametric hierarchies is of course a separate question.</p>
<p>310</p>
<p>quiring English pass through a stage in which their grammar seems to include both an indefinite and a definite null object.<sup>5</sup> As noted in Mykhaylyk &#x0026; Sopata (2016), this tendency to drop objects in early stages of language development is true in general also of the entire Slavic and Romance language families.<sup>6</sup> These results are compatible with the hypothesis that <italic>n</italic>, <italic>&#x03B9;</italic>, and Restrict are present in the initial state.</p>
<p>In the analysis in part 1, I have suggested that definite object drop is restricted in English by the presence of overt articles, which can be taken to block the application of <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>in the semantics (Chierchia 1998). The analysis predicts that the process of lexical learning of the English article system should correlate with the decreasing rate of object (and subject) omission. The availability of definite objects with verbs such as <italic>call </italic>needs to be attributed to learning that some verbs/verbal roots retain the availability of <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>for the purpose of interpretation of their complement.</p>
<p>Polish lacks articles and makes the application of <italic>&#x03B9; </italic>generally available. Re-</p>
<p><sup>5</sup>P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux et al. (2008) and P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux et al. (2013) suggest that the initial state of the grammar includes a null bare noun, which is initially available without constraints and can be merged in any argument position, including the object position. The content of this noun can be recovered either by lexical means (in the case of indefinite objects) or from a discourse antecedent (in the case of definite objects). The present approach is consistent with this analysis in that the null noun postulated in P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux et al. (2008) and P&#x00E9;rez-Leroux et al. (2013) can be identified as <italic>n</italic>.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup>Interpreting results of this type certainly requires caution and omissions related to a genuine grammatical option available at a particular stage of language acquisition need to be carefully distinguished from omissions related to processing constraints.</p>
<p>311</p>
<p>strictions in the availability of definite missing objects are related to the content of <italic>n </italic>and its morphophonological realisation, including in pronominal structures. The decrease in the rate of object omission is thus expected to correlate with the acquisition of grammatical gender and nominal suffixes composing overt pronominals. As documented in Tryzna (2015), Mykhaylyk &#x0026; Sopata (2016), and Sopata (2016), children acquiring Polish overuse missing objects in comparison with adults and the omission rate decreases in the process of language development. Naturally, the exact mechanisms of the omissions and the developmental changes, including their compatibility with the approach suggested here, require further experimental investigation.</p>
<p>The decrease in omission of definite objects in Hungarian is predicted to be correlated with the acquisition of overt suffixes realising heads within the extended projection of pronouns.</p>
<p>Hypothesising that the acquisition of object drop is guided by independent features of the grammar rather than being tied only to primary linguistic data with missing objects seems to be the only plausible approach to this problem, as it is highly unclear how the child could otherwise acquire the complex set of constraining and licensing factors observed in languages such as English, Polish, and Hungarian. Testing whether the present analysis is consistent with a broader spectrum of cross-linguistic acquisitional data requires future studies within the</p>
<p>312</p>
<p>domain of language acquisition.</p>
