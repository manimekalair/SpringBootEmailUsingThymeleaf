<p>Now in its sixth edition, <italic>Persuasion: Social Influence and Compliance Gaining</italic> continues to boast an accessible voice and vibrant aesthetic that appeals to undergraduate students of communication, psychology, advertising, and marketing. In addition to presenting established theories and models, this text encourages students to develop and apply general conclusions about persuasion in real-world settings. Along the way, students are introduced to the practice of social influence in an array of contexts (e.g., advertising, marketing, politics, interpersonal relationships, social media, groups) and across a variety of topics (e.g., credibility, personality, deception, motivational appeals, visual persuasion). The new edition features an expanded treatment of digital and social media, up-to-date research on theory and practice, and enhanced discussions of topics such as political campaigning, emotional marketing, olfactory influence, and ethics. Instructors can also use the book&#x2019;s downloadable test bank, instructor&#x2019;s manual, and PowerPoint slides in preparing course material.</p>

<p>PERSUASION CONTINUES TO OCCUPY the attention of academics and non-academics alike. Not only scholars, but practitioners such as advertisers, lawyers, lobbyists, marketing firms, motivational speakers, politicians, public relations experts, social activists, syndicated columnists, and others have a vested interest in knowing how persuasion works. Therefore, students who aspire to careers in any of the &#x201C;people professions&#x201D; would be wise to acquire a basic understanding of how persuasion functions.</p>
<p>With each edition of this text, we marvel at how much persuasion changes over time, yet still remains the same. For example, controversies over &#x201C;fake news&#x201D; have altered the way people perceive facts and assess source credibility. Even so, credibility remains as central to the process of persuasion as ever. It is <italic>perceived</italic> credibility that counts. The credibility of news sources is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>The observation that &#x201C;the more persuasion changes, the more it remains the same&#x201D; applies to almost every aspect of persuasion. Compliance-gaining strategies such as the &#x201C;foot in the door&#x201D; now occur in online settings. Audience analysis is key to persuasion, but rather than examining demographic data, persuaders can now use <italic>microtargeting</italic> to tailor their messages to niche groups. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, rumors swirled that Cambridge Analytica, a company that specializes in opinion mining and data analysis, identified low-information voters in key swing states and bombarded them with highly targeted messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="refpre_4">Confessore &#x0026; Hakim, 2017</xref>). Product placement, once only found on television and in movies, is now prevalent in novels, pop music, and virtual environments such as computer games. Fear appeals, long a staple of persuaders, have moved online. In addition to being fearful of Ebola, terrorism, and clowns, we can now be worried about cyberstalking, cyberbullying, and whatever diet and nutrition advice Gwyneth Paltrow is about to post.</p>
<p>In this edition, we address the increasing importance of digital and online persuasion, while emphasizing the importance of traditional forms of persuasion as well. Since the last edition, digital persuasion has come into its own. On social media, pop-up ads and banners have given way to more sophisticated forms of marketing, such as <italic>webtracking</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="refpre_1">Avergin, 2016</xref>). Using third-party cookies, <italic>canvas fingerprinting</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="refpre_5">Kirk, 2014</xref>), and other techniques, Web marketers can follow users&#x2019; activities across websites. &#x201C;Like&#x201D; a bluegrass video on YouTube, &#x201C;follow&#x201D; a fiddle player on Facebook, or post some banjo pictures on Instagram, and you&#x2019;ll start getting messages about hoedowns and honky-tonks in your area.</p>
<p>Persuasion on the Web also relies on <italic>sentiment tracking</italic> or <italic>opinion mining</italic>. For example, using natural language processing software, millions of tweets can be analyzed to see what topics, people, or brands are trending and what emotion-laden <target target-type="page" id="page_xviii">xviii</target>words or emojis are being used in connection with those topics or issues. Insights about political preferences, brand images, and economic trends can be gleaned from the results. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="refpre_3">Bannister (2015)</xref> noted, &#x201C;shifts in sentiment on social media have been shown to correlate with shifts in the stock market&#x201D; (para. 3).</p>
<p>The widespread use of mobile technology has also been accompanied by increasing apps and techniques designed to influence. Texting, tweeting, and other apps disseminate word-of-mouth (WOM) messages. WOM is perceived by many as more genuine, authentic, and trustworthy than commercial advertising or expert opinions. Of course, marketers can sneak into these conversations via sponsored tweets and promoted posts. In many ways, social media has become a form of <italic>mass interpersonal persuasion</italic>. Posting a picture on Instagram may seem interpersonal in nature, but posts can be shared far beyond one&#x2019;s social network. Just ask Anthony Weiner.</p>
<p>Despite the advent of digital and social media, most of us still live in a face-to-face world, too. Traditional forms of influence still matter, and interacting &#x201C;in person&#x201D; is by far the most effective way to persuade other people. A retail salesperson talking to a customer has a much greater chance of success than a pop-up ad reminding you about the last item you viewed on Amazon.com. That said, we often underestimate our effectiveness in one-on-one-settings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="refpre_6">Roghanizad and Bohns (2017)</xref> found that when people were asked to judge their influence via email versus in person, they overestimated the former and underestimated the latter. Groups, too, exert enormous influence over people. Whether within a family, a classroom, a workplace, at a coffee shop with friends, or some other group setting, the pressure to conform or risk being isolated is potent. Mass persuasion has greater reach, but less effectiveness.</p>
<p>As long as humans occupy planet Earth, they will be engaged in persuading one another. If apes or machines do take over one day, who can say? For now, we believe a solid understanding of persuasion, social influence, and compliance gaining will be an asset in this world. With that in mind, we hope you catch our enthusiasm for this field of study and turn the pages of this book with a better understanding of how persuasion functions, an improved knowledge of ways to maximize your own persuasion efforts, and a greater ability to resist influence attempts, especially unscrupulous influence attempts, by others.</p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_2">2</target>ONE OF THE AUTHORS was enjoying a day at the beach with his family. As he sat in a folding chair, lost in a good book, he could hear the cries of seagulls overhead and the pounding of the surf. Nothing was bothering him. He was oblivious to the world around him. Or so he thought. As he reflected more on the situation, however, he became aware that he was being bombarded by persuasive messages on all sides. A boom box was playing a few yards away. During commercial breaks, various ads tried to convince him to choose a new cellphone provider, switch auto insurance companies, and try a hot, spicy cheeseburger. A nearby sign warned that no alcohol, glass objects, or smoking were permitted on the beach. A plastic bag in which a nearby family&#x2019;s children had brought their beach toys advertised Walmart on its side. The family picnic cooler proudly displayed its manufacturer, Igloo, as well.</p>
<p>And that was only the beginning. A plane flew overhead, trailing a banner that advertised a collect calling service. The lifeguard&#x2019;s tower displayed a Hurley logo. Their swimsuits were sponsored by Izod. The lifeguard&#x2019;s truck, a specially equipped Toyota, announced that it was the &#x201C;official emergency vehicle&#x201D; of &#x201C;Surf City USA,&#x201D; a moniker trademarked by the city of Huntington Beach, California. Oh, the indignity of being rescued by an unofficial vehicle.</p>
<p>There were oral influence attempts, too. His son tried to lure him into the water by saying, &#x201C;Come on, it&#x2019;s not that cold.&#x201D; But he knew better. His son <italic>always</italic> said that, no matter how cold the water was. &#x201C;Would you mind keeping an eye on our things?&#x201D; the family next to the author&#x2019;s asked. I guess our family looks trustworthy, he thought. His wife asked him, &#x201C;Do you want to walk down to the pier? They have frozen bananas.&#x201D; She knew he would be unable to resist the temptation.</p>
<p>And those were only the overt persuasive messages. A host of more subtle messages also competed for the author&#x2019;s attention. A few yards away, a woman was applying sun block to her neck and shoulders. The author decided he&#x2019;d better do the same. Had she nonverbally influenced him to do likewise? Nearby, a young couple was soaking up the sun. Both were wearing hats with the Nike &#x201C;swoosh&#x201D; logo. Were they &#x201C;advertising&#x201D; that brand? A young man with a boogie board ran by, headed for the water. His head was shaved and he sported a goodly amount of body art. Did his appearance advocate a particular set of values or tastes? Was he a billboard for an &#x201C;alternative&#x201D; lifestyle? A half dozen male heads turned in unison as a trio of bikini-clad women walked by. Were the males &#x201C;persuaded&#x201D; to turn their heads or was this simply an involuntary reflex? Two tan, muscular dudes were tossing a Frisbee back and forth. Both had six-pack abs. The author made a mental note to do more sit-ups. There seemed to be as many persuasive messages, or potentially persuasive messages, as there were shells on the beach.</p>
<p>The preceding examples raise two important issues. First, persuasion and social influence are pervasive. We are surrounded by influence attempts, both explicit and implicit, no matter where we are. As Cascio, Scholz, and Falk emphasize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_10">2015</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>social influence is omnipresent, occurring through implicit observation of cultural norms, face-to-face and mediated interpersonal communication, as well as mass mediated communication. Even though individuals are often unaware of the power of social influence, research shows its effects on behavior in a wide variety of circumstances.</p>
<attrib>(p. 51)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_3">3</target>Second, it is difficult to say with any certainty what is and is not &#x201C;persuasion.&#x201D; Where should we draw the line between persuasion and other forms of communication? We address the first of these issues in this chapter. Here we examine the pervasive nature of persuasion and offer a rationale for learning more about its workings. In the next chapter, we tackle the issue of what constitutes <italic>persuasion</italic> and related terms such as <italic>social influence</italic> and <italic>compliance gaining.</italic></p>
<sec id="sec1_1">
<title>Aims and Goals</title>
<p>This is a book about persuasion. Its aims are at once academic and practical. On the academic side, we examine how and why persuasion functions the way it does. In so doing, we identify some of the most recent theories and findings by persuasion researchers. On the practical side, we illustrate these theories and findings with a host of real-life examples. We also offer useful advice on how to become a more effective persuader and how to resist influence attempts, especially unethical influence attempts, by others.</p>
<p>If learning how to persuade seems a bit manipulative, remember, we don&#x2019;t live in a society populated with unicorns and rainbows. The real world is brimming with persuaders. You can avoid learning about persuasion, perhaps, but you can&#x2019;t avoid persuasion itself. Besides, we can&#x2019;t tell you everything there is to know about persuasion. Nobody knows all there is to know about this subject. One of the points we stress throughout this book is that people aren&#x2019;t that easy to persuade. Human beings are complex. They can be stubborn, unpredictable, and intractable, despite the best efforts of persuaders.</p>
<p>Persuasion is still as much an &#x201C;art&#x201D; as it is a &#x201C;science.&#x201D; Human nature is too complicated, and our understanding of persuasion too limited, to be certain which influence attempts will succeed and which will fail. Think how often you flip the channel when a commercial costing millions of dollars to produce and air appears on television. As one advertising executive put it, &#x201C;half the money I spend on advertising is wasted &#x2026; but I don&#x2019;t know which half&#x201D; (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_3">Berger, 2011</xref>, p. 1). Think how many candidates for public office have spent fortunes campaigning, only to lose their elections. Or think how difficult it is for the federal government to convince people to stop smoking, practice safe sex, or avoid texting while driving&#x2014;behaviors that are in their own self-interest.</p>
<p>The science of persuasion is still in its infancy. Despite P. T. Barnum&#x2019;s axiom that &#x201C;there&#x2019;s a sucker born every minute,&#x201D; people are uncannily perceptive at times. It is tempting to believe that if one only knew the right button to push, one could persuade anybody. More often than not, though, there are multiple buttons to push, in the right sequence, and the sequence is constantly changing. Even so, persuasion is not entirely a matter of luck. Much is known about persuasion. Persuasion has been scientifically studied since the 1940s.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Written texts on persuasion date back to ancient Greece.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1_2"><sup>2</sup></xref> A host of strategies and techniques have been identified and their effectiveness or ineffectiveness documented. Persuaders are a long way from achieving an Orwellian nightmare of thought control, but a good deal is known about how to capture people&#x2019;s hearts and minds. Before proceeding further, we want to address a common negative stereotype about persuasion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_2">
<title>Persuasion is not a Dirty Word</title>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_4">4</target>The study of persuasion has gotten some bad publicity over the years. Everyone seems to agree that the subject is fascinating, but some are reluctant to embrace a field of study that conjures up images of manipulation, deceit, or brainwashing. There is, after all, a sinister side to persuasion. Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson, Jim Jones, David Koresh, Marshall Applewhite, and Osama bin Laden were all accomplished persuaders&#x2014;much to the detriment of their followers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1_3"><sup>3</sup></xref> We, however, do not think of persuasion as the ugly stepsister in the family of human communication. Rather, we find the study of persuasion to be enormously intriguing. Persuasion is the backbone of many communicative endeavors. We can&#x2019;t resist the urge to learn more about how and why it works. Part of our fascination stems from the fact that persuasion is, on occasion, used for unsavory ends. It is therefore all the more important that researchers learn as much as they can about the strategies and tactics of unethical persuaders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_3">
<title>Persuasion is Our Friend</title>
<p>Persuasion isn&#x2019;t merely a tool used by con artists, chiselers, charlatans, cheats, connivers, and cult leaders. Nobel Peace Prize recipients and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists are also persuaders. In fact, most &#x201C;professional&#x201D; persuaders are engaged in socially acceptable, if not downright respectable, careers. They include advertising executives, bloggers, campaign managers, celebrity endorsers, clergy, congresspersons, diplomats, infomercial spokespersons, lawyers, lobbyists, mediators, media pundits, motivational speakers, political cartoonists, press secretaries, public relations experts, radio talk-show hosts, recruiters, salespersons, senators, social activists, syndicated columnists, and whistleblowers, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s focus on the positive side of persuasion for a moment. Persuasion helps forge peace agreements between nations. Persuasion helps expose corruption and open up closed societies. Persuasion is crucial to the fundraising efforts of charities and philanthropic organizations. Persuasion convinces motorists to buckle up when driving or refrain from driving when they&#x2019;ve had a few too many. Persuasion is used to convince a substance-abusing family member to seek professional help. Persuasion is how the coach of an underdog team inspires the players to give it their all. Persuasion is a tool used by parents to urge children not to accept rides from strangers or to allow anyone to touch them inappropriately. In short, persuasion is the cornerstone of a number of positive, prosocial endeavors. <italic>Very little of the good that we see in the world could be accomplished without persuasion.</italic></p>
<p>Persuasion, then, is a powerful and often prosocial force. Having highlighted the positive side of persuasion, we address the question of <italic>why</italic> the study of persuasion is so valuable. The next section, therefore, offers a justification for the study of social influence.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_5">5</target>The Pervasiveness of Persuasion: You Can Run but You Can&#x2019;t Hide</title>
<p>We&#x2019;ve already mentioned one of the primary reasons for learning about this subject: Persuasion is a central feature of every sphere of human communication. The same is true of social influence. We can&#x2019;t avoid it. We can&#x2019;t make it go away. Like Elvis impersonators in Las Vegas, persuasion is here to stay. Various estimates suggest that the average person is exposed to anywhere from 300 to 5,000 messages per day.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1_4"><sup>4</sup></xref> There are more ways to persuade than ever before. Indeed, traditional persuasion in the form of political speeches, television commercials, print ads, billboards, and product placements in movies and television is alive and well. So too are protest marches, demonstrations, sit-ins, and other forms of symbolic action. In the last two decades, social media has been added to the mix. You can submit online reviews of products and services, post a YouTube video advocating your message, engage in <italic>hashtag activism,</italic> advocate a cause via Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, solicit funding via crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe, or promote change through a website such as <uri>www.change.org</uri> or <uri>www.dosomething.org</uri>. Let&#x2019;s consider one of these pervasive strategies, known as <italic>viral persuasion,</italic> more closely.</p>
<sec id="sec1_4_1">
<title>Tipping Points, Buzz Marketing, and Word of Mouth</title>
<p>Key concepts and principles associated with viral persuasion were laid out by Malcolm Gladwell in his bestseller, <italic>The Tipping Point</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_22">2000</xref>). Gladwell likens word-of-mouth (WOM) to a virus through which a message is spread until the whole society is &#x201C;infected.&#x201D; Based on what he calls <italic>&#x201C;the law of the few,&#x201D;</italic> a small number of influential people can generate a groundswell of support for an idea, brand, or phenomenon. If a message gains sufficient traction, it reaches a tipping point and becomes &#x201C;contagious.&#x201D; In order to reach the tipping point, however, a number of things have to happen.</p>
<sec id="sec1_4_1_1">
<title>&#x00DC;ber Influencers</title>
<p>First, the right kinds of people must be involved. Gladwell identifies three types of people who are essential to the process. <italic>Mavens</italic> possess specialized expertise. They are in the know. They may be celebrity chefs, fashionistas, fitness gurus, tech geeks, or wine snobs. Mavens needn&#x2019;t be rich or famous, but they must be ahead of the curve. They are the early adopters, opinion leaders, or what some call <italic>alpha consumers,</italic> the ones who hear about ideas and try out gadgets first. &#x201C;One American in ten,&#x201D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_32">Keller and Barry (2003)</xref> maintain, &#x201C;tells the other nine how to vote, where to eat, and what to buy&#x201D; (p. 1).</p>
<p>In addition to mavens, Gladwell states that <italic>connectors</italic> are also essential. Based on the viral metaphor, they are carriers. They have large social networks. When connectors learn from mavens what the &#x201C;next big thing&#x201D; is, they spread the word. Since social circles tend to be overlapping, forwarding messages spreads them increasingly outward from their epicenter.</p>
<p>The last type Gladwell identifies is <italic>salespeople.</italic> They receive the message from a connector and then talk it up within their own circle of friends. Salespeople tell their friends, &#x201C;You must see this movie,&#x201D; &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got to try this restaurant,&#x201D; or &#x201C;You gotta read this book.&#x201D;</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_6">6</target>Orchestrating the Next Big Thing</title>
<p>In addition to having the right kinds of people, some additional conditions must be satisfied for an idea to go viral. <italic>Context</italic> is critical. The idea must come along at the right time and place. Twitter, for example, wouldn&#x2019;t have worked before there was widespread mobile access to the Internet. An idea also must possess <italic>stickiness</italic>, which means that it is inherently attractive. Without some sort of natural appeal, people won&#x2019;t gravitate toward the idea or pass it along (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_24">Heath &#x0026; Heath, 2008</xref>). For example, in 2014, the ALS water bucket challenge, which dared people to dump ice water over their own or other people&#x2019;s heads, went viral, raising over &#x0024;100 million in the USA alone (<uri>www.als.org</uri>). Its stickiness was based, in part, on its eye-catching appeal, its urgency (there was a 24-hour deadline to respond), and the fact that it was for a good cause.</p>
<p><italic>Scalability</italic> is another requirement: It must be easy to ramp up production of the idea, product, or message to meet demand. The ice-bucket challenge met this requirement because almost everyone can find a bucket and some ice. Finally, <italic>effortless transfer</italic> is yet another ingredient in the recipe for an effective viral campaign. A viral campaign has to leverage free media. Ideas that can be spread by forwarding an email, including an attachment, or embedding a link are easy to disseminate. The more time, effort, or money it takes to spread the word, the less likely the idea will go viral. In the ice-bucket campaign, most challenges were issued from one friend to another via video.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_4_1_3">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_7">7</target>Infectious or Inexplicable?</title>
<p>Although viral marketing holds considerable potential, it is often a hit-or-miss strategy, with far more misses than hits. What&#x2019;s more, evidence for the effectiveness of tipping points is largely anecdotal, and there is no guarantee that an idea will gain traction. If one does, its shelf life is often limited. The ice-bucket challenge, for example, came and went in a few months. And flash mobs, another approach to viral marketing, were a flash in the pan.</p>
<p>The Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMM) offers advice for conducting viral campaigns. The very concept of viral marketing, however, is something of an oxymoron. A viral campaign is planned to appear unplanned. It is contrived to seem genuine. As consumers grow wise to the strategy, it will become less effective. There are also ethical questions about using friends as shills. The FTC now requires any online endorsement that involves compensation to be disclosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_74">Sprague &#x0026; Wells, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_4_2">
<title>Nudges: Sometimes Less Is More</title>
<p>The ubiquitous nature of persuasion is also illustrated by <italic>nudge theory,</italic> developed by Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_77">Thaler and Cass Sunstein (2008)</xref>. They maintain that subtle changes in the way choices are presented to people can influence, or &#x201C;nudge,&#x201D; them to behave in certain ways. For example, when men use a public restroom, they aren&#x2019;t always neat and tidy. They often miss the mark, to put it mildly, which increases janitorial costs significantly. To address this, folks at Amsterdam&#x2019;s Schiphol international airport gave men a target of their own. Specifically, urinals were installed that included a stenciled image of a housefly near the drain. The result? Having a target made all the difference. The men&#x2019;s aim improved considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_77">Thaler &#x0026; Sunstein, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As another example, school cafeterias tried offering apples at lunch. Most of them wound up in the trash can. However, when kids were given sliced apples, as opposed to whole apples, they were 73 percent more likely to eat them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_66">Schwartz, 2016</xref>). Similarly, when vending machines listed the calories in snack foods, people were more likely to make healthier choices.</p>
<p>Although some critics have accused nudge theory of being paternalistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_57">Pasquale, 2015</xref>), others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_76">Sunstein, 2014</xref>) argue that people are free to resist nudges if they wish. Kids can still throw apple slices in the trash. They are simply being provided with options that encourage healthy behaviors (<uri>www.nudges.org</uri>). That said, some nudges may be perceived as more like shoves. To encourage organ donors, for example, some countries have adopted a &#x201C;presumed consent&#x201D; policy, meaning that a person must take the initiative to opt out if she or he does not want to be an organ donor.</p>

<title>New Persuasion: Digital and Online Influence</title>
<p>Some people seem to spend their every waking moment texting, tweeting, blogging, or posting their views on all matter of subjects large and small. That said, social media isn&#x2019;t just an entertaining diversion, it is an important tool for influence. Whenever someone likes, follows, posts, shares, tweets or retweets, forwards, or comments on a message, online influence is taking place. Let&#x2019;s consider a few forms of digital influence.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_8">8</target>eWOM: Digital Buzz</title>
<p>Earlier, we mentioned the importance of viral persuasion and word-of-mouth (WOM). Like WOM, electronic word of mouth (eWOM) is all the rage. People actively comment on brands, companies, political issues, and public figures via all manner of social media. By way of illustration, Twitter alone accounts for 6,000 tweets per second or 500 million tweets per day (<uri>www.internetlivestats.com</uri>). Eighty percent of Twitter users have mentioned brands in their tweets and 54 percent of users report that they have acted based on tweets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_50">Midha, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Like WOM, eWOM is most effective when it is perceived as genuine rather than manufactured and peer driven rather than commercially sponsored. eWOM enjoys several advantages over traditional advertising and marketing techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_18">Erkan &#x0026; Evans, 2016</xref>). It operates largely through interpersonal channels (cellphone, email, texting), lending it an air of authenticity. It is inexpensive compared to traditional media. And it is self-perpetuating. Moreover, eWOM is far more effective than traditional media at reaching younger audiences.</p>

<title>Sponsored Content: The Native Advertisers Are Getting Restless</title>
<p>The rise of social media has spawned a surge in advertising masquerading as genuine peer-to-peer influence. For example, s<italic>ponsored content</italic> includes promoted tweets and Instagram posts, which are essentially paid advertisements. <italic>Native advertising</italic> involves ads posing as news stories. Native ads function as &#x201C;clickbait,&#x201D; luring in readers with snappy headlines or provocative photos. Both approaches are effective because many users have difficulty distinguishing such content from genuine material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_80">Wojdynski, 2016</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec1_5_3">
<title>Opinion Mining and Sentiment Tracking: I Feel You</title>
<p>The Web is an opinion-rich environment. People constantly share their attitudes, opinions, and values via social media. And marketers are listening. Many companies, for example, now specialize in <italic>opinion mining</italic> and <italic>sentiment tracking</italic> by monitoring social media to gauge the public&#x2019;s mood in nearly real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_60">Ravi &#x0026; Ravi, 2015</xref>). Sophisticated algorithms can track how a person, brand, or issue is trending based, not only on the number of tweets generated, but also on how favorable, neutral, or negative those tweets are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_33">Kennedy &#x0026; Moss, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_46">Lee, Yang, Chen, Wang, &#x0026; Sun, 2016</xref>). As an example, after analyzing over 10,000 online mentions from auto-enthusiast <target target-type="page" id="page_9">9</target>websites, the Ford Motor Company adopted a three-blink turn signal on all of its vehicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_63">Rosenbush &#x0026; Totty, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>As sophisticated as such methods seem, a problem with opinion mining is that the data is often &#x201C;squishy&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, the people commenting aren&#x2019;t always articulate or coherent. Furthermore, the tone of a message&#x2014;that is, whether it is ironic, satirical, or hyperbolic&#x2014;can be hard for artificial intelligence to decipher. Nevertheless, programmers are getting better at analyzing and interpreting words related to feelings, emotions, and opinions.</p>

<title>Gamification: You&#x2019;ve Got Game</title>
<p>Parents have known for decades that one way to get infants to eat their vegetables is by turning mealtime into a game. &#x201C;Here comes the airplane,&#x201D; the parent says with each spoonful of strained peas. A modernized version of this approach, known as <italic>gamification</italic>, is being used to stimulate consumer interest and involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_49">McGonigal, 2011</xref>). Gamification applies video-game methods to other contexts to increase consumer engagement. People like to play games. They enjoy the competition. Why else would they spend hours on end playing Angry Birds or Candy Crush? Games are entertaining, challenging, and rewarding. Transforming a mundane task into a game can make it more fun and exciting.</p>
<p>Games also can be used to influence. Take exercise, for example. Thanks to a shoe sensor that allows runners to post information about their running distance, time, and calories burned, Nike+ provides customers with a fun way to socialize, compete, and &#x201C;play&#x201D; with each other using downloadable apps (Are you game? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_1">2011</xref>). What&#x2019;s more, through points, badges, leaderboards, and other incentives, gamification keeps people coming back for more. This approach has been used to enhance education, improve workplace productivity, increase voter turnout, and promote awareness and participation in social causes.</p>
<p>Gamification is not without its critics, however. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_5">Ian Bogost (2011)</xref>, a professor and expert in video games as cultural artifacts, cautioned that &#x201C;&#x2018;exploitationware&#x2019; is a more accurate name for gamification&#x2019;s true purpose&#x201D; (para. 12). Critics charge that earning badges and points trivializes activities such as learning, working, exercising, or participating in social causes.</p>

<title>Crowdsourcing and Crowdfunding: Lending a Helping Hand</title>
<p>Moving a heavy object, like a piano, isn&#x2019;t easy. To accomplish such a task, you might invite some friends to pitch in. Similarly, <italic>crowdsourcing</italic> puts out an open call for anyone online to participate in completing a task or solving a problem. Wikipedia was one of the earliest crowdsourcing platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_45">Lee &#x0026; Seo, 2016</xref>). The online encyclopedia is collaborative. Content can be contributed and edited by any one. Crowdsourcing is premised on the assumption that wisdom is not the exclusive province of experts, but is distributed throughout the commons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_36">Kitter, 2010</xref>). As an example, Doritos invited consumers to participate in a &#x201C;Crash the Super Bowl&#x201D; contest by generating their own ideas for a 30-second commercial (for examples, got to <uri>www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vVIUBU1gZs</uri>). As another example, Starbucks&#x2019;s &#x201C;White Cup Contest&#x201D; contest solicited customers&#x2019; suggestions for a graphic design for a limited edition coffee cup. Contestants posted their creations via &#x0023;WhiteCupContest.<target target-type="page" id="page_10">10</target></p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_11">11</target>While crowdsourcing has assisted in solving problems in astronomy, legislation, language translation, and urban planning, among many areas, it is not without its critics. Detractors complain that crowdsourcing is exploitative; it relies on the unpaid labor and efforts of others. Another complaint is that the wisdom of the commons isn&#x2019;t always so wise. For example, when NASA asked people to submit names for a new section of the International Space Station, the crowd chose &#x201C;Colbert&#x201D; (after the late-night comedian) over names like &#x201C;Serenity,&#x201D; &#x201C;Earthrise,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Tranquility.&#x201D; NASA went with the name &#x201C;Tranquility&#x201D; anyway.</p>
<p>A related strategy, <italic>crowdfunding,</italic> involves raising money through online donations. Websites such as Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and Indiegogo allow people to ask for donations or start-up funds for a cause or business venture. On the plus side, crowdfunding gives &#x201C;the little guy&#x201D; or a good cause the chance to be noticed. On the downside, some of the requests are scams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_20">Fredman, 2015</xref>) and most start-ups fail. The SEC recently adopted rules regulating crowdfunding practices online.</p>

<title>Persuasive Technology: My Heart Says Yes, but My Watch Says No</title>
<p>Persuasive technology focuses on devices &#x201C;aimed at changing users&#x2019; attitudes or behaviors through persuasion and social influence, but not through coercion or deception&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_58">Persuasive Technology, 2016</xref>, para. 1). Smart devices and wearable technology &#x201C;are not just persuasive but specifically aimed at forging new habits&#x201D; <italic>(MIT Technology Review,</italic> p. 64). Smartwatches, for example, exhort wearers to take action via taps, vibrations, or other haptic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_21">Gilmore, 2016</xref>). Got a big date coming up? An app developed by MIT can tell you if you sound boring, nervous, happy, or sad based on your speech pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_44">Lee, 2017</xref>). As an alternative, you could always check to see if your date is asleep.</p>
<p>Fitness trackers not only track your daily step count, they also encourage you to exercise. For example, Fitbit&#x2019;s display shows a flower that grows or shrinks based on your activity level. Taking that concept one step further, Nissan Leaf owners can view an LCD display of a pine tree that grows as they drive more efficiently.</p>
<p>As part of the Internet of Things, smart pill bottles can remind people when to take their medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_56">Orji &#x0026; Moffat, 2016</xref>). Skip a dose and a light will glow or a chime will sound, followed by a text or phone-call reminder. For some patients, taking their medicine at the right time each day is a matter of life and death. As many as 125,000 deaths per year and &#x0024;105 billion in medical costs are attributable to patients not taking medicine properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_65">Ruggerio &#x0026; Wick, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Persuasion will continue to play a major role in traditional contexts, such as advertising and marketing. It is worth noting, though, that persuasion also plays a key role in a variety of not-so-obvious contexts. We examine two such contexts next: persuasion in the sciences, and persuasion in the arts.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_6">
<title>Persuasion in the Sciences</title>
<p>You may not think of them this way, but scientists are persuaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_23">Glassner, 2011</xref>). The ongoing debate about climate change illustrates the persuasive challenge facing climatologists. Despite widespread agreement among evolutionary biologists that evolution is a fact rather than a theory, there is a continuing social controversy over the teaching of creationism alongside evolution in public school curriculums. Even in <target target-type="page" id="page_12">12</target>fields such as chemistry, mathematics, or physics&#x2014;the so-called hard sciences&#x2014; persuasion plays a major role.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1_5"><sup>5</sup></xref> Scientists often have to convince others that their research possesses scientific merit and social value. They also have to argue for the superiority of their theories over rival theories. In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_38">Thomas Kuhn (1970)</xref> argues that all scientists employ &#x201C;techniques of persuasion in their efforts to establish the superiority of their own paradigms over those of their rivals&#x201D; (p. 151). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_53">Mitroff (1974)</xref> comments that &#x201C;the notion of the purely objective, uncommitted scientist [is] na&#x00EF;ve. &#x2026; The best scientist &#x2026; not only has points of view but also defends them with gusto&#x201D; (p. 120). Scientists must do more than conduct experiments and report their results. They also must persuade other scientists, funding agencies, and the public at large of the merits of their work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_7">
<title>Persuasion in the Arts</title>
<p>Another not-so-obvious context for persuasion is the arts. Not all art is created &#x201C;for art&#x2019;s sake.&#x201D; Art serves more than an aesthetic or decorative function. Artists have strong opinions and they lend expression to their opinions in and through their work. Consider film as an art form, for example. Movies such as <italic>12 Years a Slave, Life Is Beautiful</italic>, and <italic>Schindler&#x2019;s List</italic> demonstrate the power of the camera to increase awareness, change attitudes, alter beliefs, and shape opinions. Other art forms have the capability to persuade as well. Playwrights, painters, muralists, sculptors, photographers, and dancers give voice to their political and social views through their art.</p>
<p>Think about painting for a moment. Many of the famous works hanging in museums were created out of a sense of social conscience. Using images rather than words, artists comment on social conditions, criticize society, and attempt to transform the social order. We examine this issue in more detail in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter14">Chapter 14</xref>, but for now let&#x2019;s consider one particular work of art, Pablo Picasso&#x2019;s <italic>Guernica</italic>. Through this painting, Picasso offered a moral indictment of war and man&#x2019;s inhumanity to man. The painting features people and animals, the victims of the indiscriminate bombing of a Basque town during the Spanish Civil War, in various states of agony, torment, and grief. As Von Blum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_79">1976</xref>) notes, &#x201C;the purpose of the painting is frankly propagandistic. The artist&#x2019;s intent was to point out the inhuman character of Franco&#x2019;s fascist rebellion&#x201D; (p. 92). Picasso wasn&#x2019;t trying to paint a &#x201C;pretty&#x201D; picture. He was making a moral statement. The painting has been dubbed by one art historian &#x201C;the highest achievement in modernist political painting&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_13">Clark, 1997</xref>, p. 39). Not only Picasso, but also many other artists express persuasive points of view in and through their art.</p>

<sec id="sec1_8">
<title>Other Not-So-Obvious Contexts for Persuasion</title>
<p>Persuasion operates in a variety of other contexts, some of which are not so obvious. We highlight a few here as illustrations. Social scientists have studied bumper stickers as a form of political expression and as an unobtrusive means of measuring attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_17">Endersby &#x0026; Towle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_67">Sechrest &#x0026; Belew, 1983</xref>). Scholars have examined the effects of intercessory prayer (offered for the benefit of another person) on recovery from illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_19">Frank &#x0026; Frank, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_25">Hodge, 2007</xref>). Studies have examined the <target target-type="page" id="page_13">13</target>military&#x2019;s use of social influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_12">Cialdini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_34">King, 2010</xref>). Other researchers have focused on 12-step programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, and other support groups as forms of self-help and group influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_31">Kassel &#x0026; Wagner, 1993</xref>). Some studies have investigated terrorism as a form of persuasion by examining how jihadists are radicalized and recruited and how effective the use of violence is on the groups who are targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_4">Bhui &#x0026; Ibrahim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_26">Iyer, Hornsey, Vanman, Esposo, &#x0026; Ale, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_39">Kydd &#x0026; Walter, 2006</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_78">Tuman (2010)</xref> observed, &#x201C;the real goal of the communicated message in terrorism may be persuasion: to persuade audience members that chaos and fear will be their lot in life, to persuade them to pay attention to an issue they have ignored&#x201D; (p. 37). One scholar has written about compliance-gaining tactics found in dramatic plays, such as Shakespeare&#x2019;s <italic>Hamlet</italic> and Ibsen&#x2019;s <italic>A Doll&#x2019;s House</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_35">Kipnis, 2001</xref>). One of the authors investigated various styles and strategies of panhandling to see which ones proved most effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_61">Robinson, Seiter, &#x0026; Acharya, 1992</xref>). Research on the study of robotic persuasion is just beginning to emerge. One study found, for example, that having a robot whisper instructions to people increased their motivation to perform a boring task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_55">Nakagawa, Shiomi, Shinozawa, Matsumura, Ishiguro, &#x0026; Hagita, 2013</xref>). Another study focused on the effect of robot-to-human touch as a method of compliance gaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_69">Shiomi, Nakagawa, Shinozawa, Matsumura, Ishiguro, &#x0026; Hagita, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Weird Persuasion</title>
<p>Sometimes persuasion is downright weird. A case in point involved Kensington, Canada, where the police department threatened that any motorist arrested for drunk driving would be subjected to Nickelback music while riding in the police cruiser to the station (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_81">Zenteno, 2016</xref>). When the story went viral, Colin Jost, the news co-host of <italic>Saturday Night Live</italic>, joked, &#x201C;Just make sure the crash kills you.&#x201D; Ultimately, the policy was rescinded because the seriousness of the message was obscured by the frivolousness of the strategy.</p>
<p>Yet another example of weird persuasion occurred in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, UK. The citizens wanted to stop rowdy teens from loitering at an underpass at night. Their solution was to install street lights with a bright pink hue. Why pink, you ask? Pink light highlights acne. Teens with blemishes didn&#x2019;t want to be seen with bright, glowing acne. The plan worked: The teens moved on (Spotty teens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_73">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars sometimes investigate quirky aspects of persuasion, too. Did you know that participants in a study who consumed caffeine were more easily persuaded than participants who had no caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_48">Martin, Hamilton, McKimmie, Terry, &#x0026; Martin, 2007</xref>)? Now you do. As long as the participants were motivated to pay attention to the message, caffeine consumption increased agreement. Here is another strange finding: Washing one&#x2019;s hands not only produces cleaner hands, it also reduces a person&#x2019;s sense of guilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_30">Kaspa, 2013</xref>). The explanation for this is related to a phenomenon called <italic>embodied cognition</italic>, wherein physical behaviors often affect higher mental states.</p>
<p>Other researchers found that mixed-handed people were more persuadable and more gullible than purely left- or right-handed people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_11">Christman, Henning, Geers, Propper, &#x0026; Niebauer, 2008</xref>). And Bri&#x00F1;ol and Petty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_8">2003</xref>) discovered that asking people to nod their heads up and down (as if in agreement) made them more <target target-type="page" id="page_14">14</target>agreeable than shaking their heads back and forth (as if in disagreement). What is the point of such research, you ask? Such studies illustrate both the complexities and subtle nuances of persuasion.</p>
<p>Persuasion, then, can be found in obvious and not-so-obvious places. Before concluding this section, we examine one additional context in which persuasion occurs: the interpersonal arena.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_10">
<title>Persuasion in Interpersonal Settings</title>
<p>The extent of influence exerted in the interpersonal arena should not be underestimated. Although we may think of Madison Avenue as all-powerful, face-to-face influence is far more effective. Yet people tend to underestimate the effectiveness of in-person influence compared to other communication contexts. One study, for example, found that people making requests underestimated how successful face-to-face requests would be, compared to email requests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_62">Roghanizad &#x0026; Bohns, 2017</xref>). Another study found that people tend to underestimate their influence on others when it comes to questionable requests. Participants were asked to estimate how successful they would be at convincing a stranger to commit a minor act of vandalism (writing the word &#x201C;pickle&#x201D; on a page in a library book). Overall, 87 percent of the participants underestimated how persuasive they would be. On average, they were twice as effective as they thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_6">Bohns, Roghanizad, &#x0026; Xu, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite all the money spent on traditional advertising and the increasing amounts being spent on new media, most influence attempts still take place in face-to-face settings. Some 90 percent of word-of-mouth recommendations, for example, take place offline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_54">Moore, 2011</xref>). On a daily basis we are bombarded with persuasive requests in the interpersonal arena. Your brother wants you to hurry up and get out of the bathroom. A homeless person asks if you can spare some change. Your parents try to talk you out of getting a tongue stud. Or worse yet, your significant other uses the &#x201C;F&#x201D; word to redefine your relationship: That&#x2019;s right; she or he just wants to be &#x201C;friends.&#x201D; Aaahhh! Naturally, we persuade back as well, targeting others with our own entreaties, pleadings, and requests for favors.</p>
<p>Why is interpersonal influence so much more effective? Because it seems more genuine and less conspicuous. Consider the following scenario:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>The bait:</italic> Your friend calls up and says, &#x201C;Hey, what are you doing Friday night?&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>The nibble:</italic> Anticipating an invitation to go somewhere, you reply, &#x201C;Nothing much, why?&#x201D;</p>
<p><italic>You&#x2019;re hooked and reeled in:</italic> &#x201C;Well, I wonder if you could help me move into my new apartment then?&#x201D;</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>At least when you watch a television commercial you <italic>know</italic> the sponsor is after something from the outset. In interpersonal encounters, others&#x2019; motives may be less transparent. Most communication scholars agree that if you have a choice of mediums for persuasion, you should choose the interpersonal arena. Our advice: Next time you want to turn in a paper late, talk to your professor in person.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_15">15</target>From our discussion thus far, it should be apparent that persuasion functions as a pervasive force in virtually every facet of human communication. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_9">Kenneth Burke (1966)</xref>, among others, has written that humans are, by their very nature, symbol-using beings. One vital aspect of human symbolicity involves the tendency to persuade others. We are symbol users, and one of the principal functions of symbol usage is persuasion.</p>
<p>The recognition that social influence is an essential, pervasive feature of human symbolic action provides the strongest possible justification for the study of persuasion. Persuasion is one of the major underlying impulses for human communication. By way of analogy, one can&#x2019;t understand how an automobile works without taking a look under the hood. Similarly, one can&#x2019;t understand how human communication functions without examining one of its primary motives&#x2014;persuasion.</p>

<title>Five Benefits of Studying Persuasion</title>
<p>Given that persuasion is an inevitable fact of life, we offer five primary benefits of learning about persuasion. We refer to these as the instrumental function, the knowledge and awareness function, the defensive function, the debunking function, and the well-being function. We examine each of these in turn.</p>
<sec id="sec1_11_1">
<title>The Instrumental Function: Be All That You Can Be</title>
<p>One good reason for learning about persuasion is so that you can become a more effective persuader yourself. We refer to this as the <italic>instrumental function</italic> of persuasion, because persuasion serves as an instrument, or a means to an end. We view the ability to persuade others as an important aspect of communication competence. <italic>Communication competence</italic> involves acting in ways that are perceived as effective and appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_72">Spitzberg &#x0026; Cupach, 1984</xref>). Competent communicators possess the skills needed to achieve their objectives in fitting ways for the particular situation.</p>
<p>A competent persuader needs to know how to analyze an audience in order to adapt the message to the audience&#x2019;s frame of reference. She or he needs to be able to identify which strategies are appropriate and which will enjoy the greatest likelihood of success. A competent persuader also must know how to organize and arrange a persuasive message for maximum benefit. These are only some of the abilities required for successful persuasion.</p>
<p>But achieving the desired outcome is only one facet of communication competence. How one goes about persuading also matters. A competent persuader needs to be viewed as persuading in acceptable, appropriate ways. This means a persuader must be aware of social and cultural norms governing the persuasive situation. For example, a parent who publicly berates his or her child during a soccer match may be seen by other parents as engaging in boorish behavior.</p>
<p>We are confident that by learning more about persuasion you will become a more effective and appropriate persuader. Of course, not every influence attempt will succeed. By applying the principles and processes presented in this text, and by adhering to the ethical guidelines we offer, you should be able to improve your competence as a persuader.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_11_2">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_16">16</target>The Knowledge and Awareness Function: Inquiring Minds Want to Know</title>
<p>Another good reason for learning about persuasion is because it will enhance your knowledge and awareness of a variety of persuasive processes. Knowledge is power, as the saying goes. There is value in learning more about how persuasion operates. You may not plan on going into advertising for a living, but simply knowing how branding operates is worthwhile in and of itself. You may not plan on joining a cult (who does?), but learning more about what makes persons susceptible to cult conversion is worthwhile nonetheless. Simply from the standpoint of an observer, learning about these topics can be fascinating.</p>
<p>An additional benefit of learning about how persuasion functions concerns overcoming <italic>habitual persuasion</italic>. Many people rely on habitual forms of persuasion, regardless of whether they are effective. They get comfortable with a few strategies and tactics that they use over and over again. A good deal of our communication behavior is &#x201C;mindless,&#x201D; as opposed to mindful, meaning we don&#x2019;t pay much attention to how we communicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_40">Langer, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_41">1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_42">1989b</xref>). Sometimes persuasion operates this way. Just as runners, swimmers, and other athletes need to learn to adjust their breathing in response to different situations, persuaders&#x2014;to maximize their effectiveness&#x2014;need to learn to adapt their methods to different audiences and situations. Persuasion isn&#x2019;t a &#x201C;one-size-fits-all&#x201D; form of communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_11_3">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_17">17</target>The Defensive Function: Duck and Cover</title>
<p>A third reason for learning about how persuasion operates is vital in our view: The study of persuasion serves a <italic>defensive function</italic>. By studying how and why influence attempts succeed or fail, you can become a more discerning consumer of persuasive messages, unlike the hapless fellow depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1_4">Figure 1.4</xref>. If you know how persuasion works, you are less likely to be taken in. It is worth noting that people tend to <italic>underestimate</italic> the influence of advertising on themselves and <italic>overestimate</italic> its effects on others, a phenomenon known as the <italic>third-person effect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_14">Davidson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_27">Jensen &#x0026; Collins, 2008</xref>). Thus, you may be more defenseless than you realize.</p>

</fig>
<p>Throughout this text, we expose a number of persuasive tactics used in retail sales, advertising, and marketing campaigns. For example, we have found in our classes that after students are given a behind-the-scenes look at how car salespeople are taught to sell, several students usually acknowledge, &#x201C;Oh yeah, they did that to me.&#x201D; Admittedly, a huckster could also take advantage of the advice we offer in this book. We think it is far more likely, however, that the typical student reader will use our advice and suggestions as weapons <italic>against</italic> unethical influence attempts. <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1_1">Box 1.1</xref>, for example, offers advice on how to recognize various propaganda ploys. In later chapters of this book, we warn you about common ploys used by all manner of persuaders, from cult leaders to panhandlers to funeral home directors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_11_4">
<title>The Debunking Function: Puh-Shaw</title>
<p>A fourth reason for studying persuasion is that it serves a <italic>debunking function</italic>. The study of human influence can aid in dispelling various &#x201C;common-sense&#x201D; assumptions and &#x201C;homespun&#x201D; notions about persuasion. Traditional wisdom isn&#x2019;t always right, and it&#x2019;s worth knowing when it&#x2019;s wrong. Some individuals cling tenaciously to folk wisdom about persuasive practices that are known by researchers to be patently false. For example, many people believe that subliminal messages are highly effective and operate in a manner similar to that of post-hypnotic suggestion. This belief is pure poppycock, as we point out in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter15">Chapter 15</xref>.</p>
<p>Of considerable importance, then, are empirical findings that are <italic>counterintuitive</italic> in nature&#x2014;that is, they go against the grain of common sense. By learning about research findings on persuasion, the reader can learn to ferret out the true from the false, the fact from the fiction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_11_5">
<title>Well-Being and Self-Worth: I Feel Good</title>
<p>A fifth benefit of learning about persuasion is that the ability to persuade others improves one&#x2019;s subjective sense of well-being. There is a sense of satisfaction that comes from persuading others. Researchers have found that influencing others satisfies five basic needs, which are accuracy, belonging, self-worth, control, and meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_7">Bourgeois, Sommer, &#x0026; Bruno, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_71">Sommer &#x0026; Bourgeois, 2010</xref>). The first need, accuracy, refers to the desire to be right about one&#x2019;s beliefs and attitudes. One of the author&#x2019;s spouses likes to joke, &#x201C;I married Mr. Right. Mr. <italic>always</italic> Right.&#x201D; Winning someone over is one way of validating one&#x2019;s own views.</p>

<caption><title>Persuasion Versus Propaganda and Indoctrination</title></caption>
<p>What are propaganda and indoctrination and how do they differ from persuasion? To a large extent, it is a matter of perspective. People tend to label their own messages as persuasion and the other guy&#x2019;s as propaganda. The same applies to indoctrination: We tend to think that our government educates its citizens, but foreign governments, especially those we dislike, indoctrinate their citizens. Understood in this way, propaganda and indoctrination are largely pejorative terms used to describe persuasive messages or positions with which people disagree. Gun control advocates claim the NRA uses propaganda to thwart legislation that would place restrictions on gun sales. Opponents of school prayer think that requiring students to recite a prayer in class constitutes a form of religious indoctrination. When accused of propagandizing, the common defense is to state that one was only engaged in an education or information campaign. Thus, whether a given attempt at influence, such as the D.A.R.E. campaign, is persuasion, propaganda, or indoctrination is largely in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Definitions of propaganda are many and varied, but we happen to think Pratkanis and Aronson&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_59">1991</xref>) definition does a good job of capturing the essence of the term:
<disp-quote>
<p>Propaganda was originally defined as the dissemination of biased ideas and opinions, often through the use of lies and deception. &#x2026; The word propaganda has since evolved to mean mass &#x201C;suggestion&#x201D; or influence through the manipulation of symbols and the psychology of the individual. Propaganda is the communication of a point of view with the ultimate goal of having the recipient come to &#x201C;voluntarily&#x201D; accept the position as if it were his or her own.</p>
<attrib>(p. 9)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Different scholars have offered different views on the nature and characteristics of propaganda (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_16">Ellul, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_29">Jowett &#x0026; O&#x2019;Donnell, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_70">Smith, 1989</xref>). However, there are some essential characteristics on which most scholars agree. These are as follows:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Propaganda has a strong ideological bent. Most scholars agree that propaganda does not serve a purely informational function. Propaganda typically embodies a strong bias, such as that of a &#x201C;left-wing&#x201D; or &#x201C;right-wing&#x201D; agenda. The campaign of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to promote animal rights would fall into this category. Propagandists aren&#x2019;t trying to be neutral or objective. They are working a specific agenda.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Propaganda is institutional in nature. Most scholars agree that propaganda is practiced by organized groups, whether they happen to be government agencies, political lobbies, private corporations, religious groups, or social movements. For instance, the Anti-Defamation League is an organization founded to prevent libeling and slandering of Jewish people. Although individuals might use propaganda too (a parent might tell a child, &#x201C;Santa only brings presents for good girls and boys&#x201D;), the term usually is associated with institutional efforts to persuade.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Propaganda involves mass persuasion. Most scholars agree that propaganda targets a mass audience and relies on mass media to persuade. Propaganda is aimed at large numbers of people and, as such, relies on mass communication (TV, radio, posters, billboards, email, mass mailings, etc.) to reach its audience. Thus, gossip that was shared by one office worker with another at the water cooler wouldn&#x2019;t constitute propaganda, but a corporate rumor that was circulated via email would.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Propaganda tends to rely on ethically suspect methods of influence. Propagandists tend to put results first and ethics second. This characteristic is probably the one that laypersons most closely associate with propaganda and the one that gives it its negative connotation.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_19">19</target>What are some of the questionable tactics used by propagandists? The Institute for Propaganda Analysis, which was founded in 1937, identified seven basic propaganda techniques, which still exist today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_51">Miller, 1937</xref>). These include the plain folks appeal (&#x201C;I&#x2019;m one of you&#x201D;), testimonials (&#x201C;I saw the aliens, sure as I&#x2019;m standing here&#x201D;), the bandwagon effect (everybody&#x2019;s doing it), card-stacking (presenting only one side of the story), transfer (positive or negative associations, such as guilt by association), glittering generalities (idealistic or loaded language, such as &#x201C;freedom,&#x201D; &#x201C;empowering,&#x201D; &#x201C;family values&#x201D;), and name calling (&#x201C;racist,&#x201D; &#x201C;tree hugger,&#x201D; &#x201C;femi-Nazi&#x201D;).</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>The need for belonging reflects the desire for social inclusion. People value social connections. Persuading others is one means of establishing and maintaining relationships. People also strive to maintain a positive self-concept or sense of self-worth. The ability to persuade others enhances a person&#x2019;s self-esteem. The need for control, or perceived control, stems from a desire to shape our environment and exert influence over those with whom we interact. Some people like to be in charge, take over, and have things their way. Others are content to let someone else take the helm. Yet everyone seeks some degree of self-efficacy or a sense that she or he is in control of their life. Lastly, people want to believe there is meaning and purpose in their lives. One way of demonstrating one&#x2019;s value or importance is by influencing others.</p>
<p>We hope you&#x2019;ll agree, based on the foregoing discussion, that there are quite a few good reasons for studying persuasion. We hope we&#x2019;ve persuaded you that the study of persuasion can be a prosocial endeavor. That brings us back to an earlier point, however: Not all persuaders are scrupulous. At this juncture, then, it seems appropriate that we address two common criticisms related to the study of persuasion.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_12">
<title>Two Criticisms of Persuasion</title>
<sec id="sec1_12_1">
<title>Does Learning About Persuasion Foster Manipulation?</title>
<p>We&#x2019;ve already touched on one of the common criticisms of studying persuasion: the notion that it fosters a manipulative approach to communication. We address ethical concerns surrounding the study and practice of persuasion more specifically in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter16">Chapter 16</xref>. For the time being, however, a few general arguments can be offered in response to this concern. First, our principal focus in this text is on the <italic>means</italic> of persuasion (e.g., how persuasion functions). We view the means of persuasion not so much as moral or immoral, but rather as amoral, or ethically neutral. In this respect, persuasion can be likened to a tool, such as a hammer. Like any other tool, persuasion can be put to good or bad use. If this sounds like a cop-out, read what Aristotle had to say on this same point in his <italic>Rhetoric</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>If it is urged that an abuse of the rhetorical faculty can work great mischief, the same charge can be brought against all good things (save virtue itself), and especially against the most useful things such as strength, health, wealth, and military skill. Rightly employed, they work the greatest blessings; and wrongly employed, they work the greatest harm.</p>
<attrib>(1355b)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Related to this idea is the fact that tools can be used in good or bad ways, depending on their user. We believe that first and foremost, a <italic>persuader&#x2019;s motives</italic> <target target-type="page" id="page_20">20</target>determine whether a given influence attempt is good or bad, right or wrong, ethical or unethical. We maintain that the moral quality of a persuasive act is derived primarily from the ends a persuader seeks, and only secondarily from the means the persuader employs. It isn&#x2019;t so much <italic>what</italic> strategies and tactics a persuader uses as <italic>why</italic> he or she uses them.</p>
<p>To illustrate, suppose you asked us whether the use of &#x201C;fear appeals&#x201D; is ethically justified. We would have to say, it depends. If a fear appeal were being used to warn sexually active teens of the risks of HIV infection from unprotected sex, we would tend to say the appeal was justified. If a fear appeal were being used by a terrorist who threatened to kill a hostage every hour until his demands were met, we would say the appeal was unjustified. In each case, the motives of the persuader would &#x201C;color&#x201D; the use of the fear appeal. Consistent with our tool analogy, fear appeals, like other persuasive strategies, can be used for good or bad ends.</p>
<p>A second response to this criticism was highlighted earlier. The study of persuasion performs a <italic>defensive function</italic> insofar as it educates people to become more discriminating consumers of persuasive messages. For instance, we believe our &#x201C;Tips on Buying a New or Used Car&#x201D; (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1_2">Box 1.2</xref>) are useful to any potential car buyer who wants to avoid being manipulated at a car lot. By increasing your awareness of the ploys of would-be persuaders, this text performs a watchdog function. You can use the information contained herein to arm yourself against the tactics of unscrupulous persuaders.</p>
<p>A third response that bears mentioning is that in denouncing the study of persuasion, antimanipulation types are also attempting to persuade. The message that persuasion is manipulative or exploitative is itself a persuasive appeal that advocates a position regarding the &#x201C;proper&#x201D; study of communication. When one group claims to know best how human communication should be studied, they are, in fact, standing on the persuasion soapbox themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec1_12_2">
<title>Are Persuasion Findings Too Inconsistent or Confusing?</title>
<p>An additional complaint is that the study of persuasion has led to findings that are overly qualified, or contradictory in nature. Empirical investigations of persuasion, it is argued, have not yielded clear and consistent generalizations. There is no &#x201C;<italic>E</italic> = <italic>mc</italic><sup>2</sup>,&#x201D; no &#x201C;second law of thermodynamics,&#x201D; no universal when it comes to persuasion.</p>
<p>First, the complaint that persuasion isn&#x2019;t worth studying because the findings are often inconclusive or contradictory makes little sense. Quite the opposite: We believe that persuasion warrants study precisely because it <italic>is</italic> so elusive. Underlying this criticism is the expectation that reality is, or should be, simple and uncomplicated. Like it or not, understanding reality is hard work. As we&#x2019;ve already noted, human beings are complex creatures who rarely respond to messages for one and only one reason. Actually, we find this to be a redeeming feature of humanity. We rejoice in the fact that we aren&#x2019;t an altogether gullible, predictable, or controllable species.</p>
<p>A second response to this criticism is simply that persuasion research <italic>has</italic> revealed a number of significant, relevant generalizations. You&#x2019;ll find many such generalizations throughout this book. Newer techniques of statistical analysis, such <target target-type="page" id="page_21">21</target>as <italic>meta-analysis</italic>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1_6"><sup>6</sup></xref> have made it possible to reconcile some of the previous inconsistencies in the literature. In this text, we identify a number of noteworthy, albeit qualified, generalizations that are based on the most recent meta-analyses available.</p>

<caption><title>Tips on Buying a New or Used Car</title></caption>
<p>Given the current state of the economy and the economic fix in which car dealers find themselves, buying a car nowadays is easier than before. Car dealers are eager to sell cars. Nevertheless, car salespersons, especially used car salespersons, have a bad reputation. We&#x2019;ve met some honest, upstanding sellers. We&#x2019;ve also met some shady operators. Because a car is a major purchase, one would be well advised to err on the side of caution when negotiating with a car salesperson. Caveat emptor, as the saying goes: Let the buyer beware.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Be wary. Remember, buying a car is a ritual in which the car dealer has the upper hand. This is the prototype for high-pressure sales. They are professionals. They sell cars every day. You are an amateur. Who do you think has more experience with persuasion in this setting?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do your homework before you go visit a car dealer. Read up on the makes and models in which you&#x2019;re interested. Find out about performance criteria, standard features, and options before setting foot on a car lot. Consumer Reports compares used cars on reliability, safety, and other criteria based on data from actual owners. Research shows that doing your homework can save you money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_68">Seiter &#x0026; Seiter, 2005</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Keep a poker face. If the salesperson knows you are eager or excited about the car purchase, he or she will smell blood. Once the salesperson knows you are emotionally attached to a particular car, you&#x2019;ll wind up paying more.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Take a calculator with you. Car salespersons like to pretend that the prices of things are entirely up to the calculator (&#x201C;Hey, let&#x2019;s see how the numbers shake out&#x201D;). The implication is that the numbers aren&#x2019;t negotiable or flexible. Everything is negotiable. Do your own figuring to see if the numbers &#x201C;shake out&#x201D; the same way. If not, ask why.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Once you are on the car lot, dealers will try to keep you there. They may put you in a cubicle, holding you &#x201C;hostage&#x201D; during the negotiations. Their psychological strategy is to wear you down. After hours of haggling, you&#x2019;ll become mentally drained and more likely to give in. They may ask for the keys to your trade-in, presumably to look it over and determine its value. Once they have your keys, you can&#x2019;t leave.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The car salesperson will want to avoid talking about the total price of the car, opting instead to discuss the monthly payment you can afford. You, however, should focus on four things: (a) the total purchase price, (b) the finance period, (c) the interest rate, and (d) the monthly payment. Don&#x2019;t discuss the monthly payment unless you are clear on the finance period involved (a 3-year loan, 4-year loan, 5-year loan, etc.). If you admit you can afford &#x0024;300 per month, the salesperson may simply switch to a longer finance period&#x2014;say, 4 years, instead of 3, thereby adding thousands of dollars to the total purchase price.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>During the negotiations, the salesperson may leave the room a number of times to talk with the &#x201C;sales manager.&#x201D; This is all choreographed. The salesperson can&#x2019;t agree to anything without checking with this mysterious figure, so the person with whom you are negotiating really can&#x2019;t commit to anything. You, however, will be asked to commit to a lot of things. Don&#x2019;t.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The salesperson will act like he or she is your best friend, even though you just met. The salesperson will look for ways to identify with you or ingratiate himself or herself to you to establish camaraderie (&#x201C;You like fly fishing? That makes two of us.&#x201D; &#x201C;Whaddya-know, my granddaughter is named &#x2018;Fifi&#x2019; too!&#x201D;). During the negotiations, the salesperson will pretend he or she is on your side and is willing to go out on a limb for you (&#x201C;Well, my sales manager may <target target-type="page" id="page_23">23</target>kick my butt for even taking him this offer, but hey, I like you&#x201D;). Remember, these two are working as a team, against you. Don&#x2019;t be confused for a moment about where the salesperson&#x2019;s loyalties reside. 9. The car salesperson will do all kinds of things to get you to make a commitment to buy (&#x201C;What would it take to get you to buy this car? Just tell me, whudda-I-godda-do to get you in this car?&#x201D;). Often, the salesperson will ask you to write down any amount you&#x2019;re offering on a slip of paper or an offer sheet, even though it isn&#x2019;t legally binding (it does increase your psychological commitment, however). The car dealer wants you to sit in the car, take it for a test spin, smell the upholstery, because then you will become psychologically committed to owning the car.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If you get close to a deal, or alternatively, if a deal seems to be coming apart, don&#x2019;t be surprised if another salesperson comes in to take over the negotiations. Often a &#x201C;closer&#x201D; is sent in (sort of like a relief pitcher in baseball) to complete the sale.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Beware of &#x201C;loss leaders&#x201D; (advertised specials at absurdly low prices). These are come-ons designed to get you onto the lot. Once there, however, you&#x2019;ll be subjected to the &#x201C;old switcheroo.&#x201D; You&#x2019;ll find there is/was only one car at that price. You will probably be told, &#x201C;Sorry, it&#x2019;s already sold &#x2026; but I can make you a honey of a deal on &#x2026;&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The sale isn&#x2019;t over simply because you&#x2019;ve agreed on a price. You still have to deal with the dreaded &#x201C;finance person.&#x201D; You&#x2019;ll be given the impression that you&#x2019;re simply seeing the finance person to sign documents and process paperwork. Don&#x2019;t let down your guard. The finance person will try to add on thousands of dollars in the form of extended warranties, antitheft systems, and protective coatings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The interest rate is just as important as the price of the car. Shop around for a car loan from a bank or credit union before you shop for a car. The rates may be lower and you can find out exactly how much you qualify for in advance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Shop around for prices on options such as stereos before you go to a car dealer. People often bargain well on the purchase price, then give up everything they&#x2019;ve gained by failing to bargain on the price of extras. The price of everything is negotiable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Don&#x2019;t let the salesperson know in advance that you have a trade-in. Any bargaining gains you make on the purchase price of the new car will just be deducted from the trade-in value of your used car. Sell the used car on your own, if at all possible. If that&#x2019;s not possible, you can always mention your trade-in after you&#x2019;ve negotiated the price of the new car.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Don&#x2019;t get a lemon. Buying a used car can be particularly risky. One of the authors bought a used sports car on eBay. How did he know from a mere picture and description whether the car was in good shape? He ran a CARFAX history on the car, easily available online (see <uri>www.carfax.com</uri>), which revealed that the car had had only one previous owner; had never been stolen, totaled, or repossessed; had correct odometer readings; and had passed a smog check each year when the vehicle registration was renewed. Since the car was coming from another state, the author went one step further and hired an independent mechanic to perform a &#x201C;prepurchase inspection&#x201D; on the car, at a cost of about &#x0024;150. We strongly suggest you do the same for any used car. After all, how much can the average consumer tell about a car from looking under the hood and kicking the tires?</p></list-item>

<p>You&#x2019;ll notice in this book that we&#x2019;ve drawn on the people in the trenches themselves to learn how persuasion works in particular contexts and settings. We&#x2019;ve talked to used car salespersons, funeral home operators, retail clothing clerks, advertising firms, former cult members, door-to-door salespersons, and telemarketers to find out&#x2014;from the horse&#x2019;s mouth, so to speak&#x2014;how persuasion operates.</p>

<title>Ethical Concerns about the Use of Persuasion</title>
<p>We would be remiss if we concluded this chapter without emphasizing the importance of ethics in the persuasion process. We wish to underscore the point that the use of <target target-type="page" id="page_24">24</target>persuasion is fraught with ethical concerns. We raise a number of such concerns in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1_3">Box 1.3</xref> for you to ponder. Our position is that in learning how to become a more effective persuader, you should strive to be an ethical persuader as well. In the final chapter, we address a number of ethical questions related to various strategies and techniques of persuasion discussed throughout the text. We wait until the final chapter to fully examine ethical concerns for two reasons: First, until you&#x2019;ve learned more about persuasion, you may not fully appreciate all of the ethical issues that are involved. Second, after you&#x2019;ve studied the full scope of persuasion as we present it in this text, you&#x2019;ll be in a much better position to place these ethical questions in perspective.</p>

<p>Instructions: For each of the following scenarios, indicate how ethical or unethical you perceive the persuader or the persuasive strategy to be, based on a five-point scale (with 1 being &#x201C;highly ethical&#x201D; and 5 being &#x201C;highly unethical&#x201D;).</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>We hope that we&#x2019;ve convinced you of the ubiquity of persuasion in human interaction. The capacity to persuade is one of the defining features of humankind. This fact provides the strongest possible reason for studying persuasion. Given that learning about persuasion serves an instrumental function, a knowledge and awareness function, a defensive function, a debunking function, and a well-being and self-worth function, we believe there is ample justification for studying this topic. Finally, rejoinders to two current criticisms of the study of persuasion were offered. Hopefully, a persuasive case has been made for learning about persuasion.</p>
<p>One other thing: Did we mention that learning about persuasion can also be fun?</p>

<title>Notes</title>
<fn id="fn1_1"><label>1</label><p>The scientific study of persuasion dates back to the 1940s and 1950s, when Carl Hovland founded the Yale Attitude Research Program as part of the war effort.</p>
<p>The government wanted to know how to counter enemy propaganda that could affect the morale of troops and how susceptible POWs were to brainwashing.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn1_2"><label>2</label><p>Aristotle&#x2019;s work <italic>Rhetoric</italic> is one such text that has survived the test of time. Written in the fourth century BCE, Aristotle&#x2019;s work has had a lasting influence on our understanding of persuasion. Many of his insights and observations are considered valid even today.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn1_3"><label>3</label><p>Note that with the exception of Hitler, these charismatic leaders enjoyed a limited following. The rest of us weren&#x2019;t taken in by their claims, suggesting that people, in general, aren&#x2019;t that gullible after all.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn1_4"><label>4</label><p>A <italic>New York Times</italic> article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_75">Story, 2007</xref>) sets daily ad exposure at up to 5,000 ads per day. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_64">Rosseli, Skelly, and Mackie (1995)</xref> state, &#x201C;even by conservative estimates, the average person is exposed to 300&#x2013;400 persuasive messages a day from the mass media alone&#x201D; (p. 163). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_28">Jones (2004)</xref> pegs the number of advertising messages at 300 to 1,500 every day, but indicates that some estimates are as high as 3,000 per day&#x2014;a number Jones labels fanciful (p. 12). Without saying who says so, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_3">Berger (2011)</xref> reports that &#x201C;some estimate that we are exposed to 15,000 commercial messages each day&#x201D; (p. 101).</p>
<p>We are suspicious of such estimates, however, because they may simply represent &#x201C;unknowable&#x201D; statistics. At the very least, estimates of the number of persuasive messages to which the average person is exposed involve extrapolations, and the criteria upon which the extrapolations are based aren&#x2019;t always provided. What&#x2019;s more, <target target-type="page" id="page_25">25</target>the estimates often contradict one another. By way of illustration, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_3">Berger (2011)</xref> maintains that &#x201C;advertisers spend around &#x0024;800 per person in the United States on advertising&#x201D; (p. 101), whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_15">Dupont (1999)</xref> claims, &#x201C;In the U.S., close to &#x0024;400 for every man, woman, and child are invested in advertising each year&#x201D; (p. 8). Which, if either, estimate is correct?</p></fn>
<fn id="fn1_5"><label>5</label><p>We don&#x2019;t have sufficient space to devote to this topic here, but suffice it to say that the traditional notion of scientific realism is under siege from the antirealism camp (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_37">Kourany, 1998</xref>). The antirealists argue that science is neither purely objective nor impartial but heavily value laden (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_43">Laudan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1_47">Longino, 1990</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn1_6"><label>6</label><p><italic>Meta-analysis</italic> refers to a statistical technique that allows a researcher to combine the results of many separate investigations and examine them as if they were one big super study. A meta-analysis is capable of revealing trends across a number of studies and resolving apparent inconsistencies among studies.</p></fn>

<p>WHAT IS PERSUASION? How broad or narrow is the concept? Is persuasion a subset of human communication in general, much like baseball is a subset of sports? Or is persuasion an element found in all human communication in the same way that coordination plays a role in every sport? Not surprisingly, different authors view the concept of persuasion in different ways and have adopted different definitions of the term. In this chapter, we explore some of the ways that persuasion has been defined. We offer our own rather broad-based, far-reaching conceptualization of persuasion based on five limiting criteria. We also present our own model of what persuasion is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_22">Gass &#x0026; Seiter, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_23">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_24">2004</xref>) and examine three additional models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_10">Chaiken, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_11">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_20">Eagly &#x0026; Chaiken, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_41">Petty &#x0026; Cacioppo, 1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_42">1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_29">Kruglanksi &#x0026; Thompson, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_30">1999b</xref>) of how persuasion functions.</p>
<p>You may have encountered some unusual uses of the term <italic>persuasion.</italic> For example, we have a friend in the construction industry who refers to his <target target-type="page" id="page_31">31</target>sledgehammer as his &#x201C;persuader.&#x201D; He tends to err on the side of cutting a 2 &#x00D7; 4 board too long, rather than too short, and then &#x201C;persuading&#x201D; it into place. As another example, you may recall seeing an old gangster movie in which a mob boss orders his henchman to take somebody out back &#x201C;for a little gentle persuasion,&#x201D; meaning a beating. Although we don&#x2019;t normally associate persuasion with pounding lumber or pummeling people, even in ordinary usage the term does have a wide variety of meanings. Consider each of the hypothetical situations in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2_1">Box 2.1</xref>, &#x201C;What Constitutes Persuasion?&#x201D; Which of these scenarios do <italic>you</italic> consider to be persuasion?</p>

</boxed-text>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_32">32</target>Adding to the difficulty of defining persuasion is the fact that persuasion also goes by a variety of other names. Some of its aliases include terms such as <italic>advising, brainwashing, coercion, compliance gaining, convincing, education, indoctrination, influence, manipulation,</italic> and <italic>propaganda.</italic> Of course, whether these terms are considered synonyms for persuasion, or simply related terms, depends on one&#x2019;s definition of persuasion.</p>
<p>Defining a concept is analogous to building a fence. A fence is designed to keep somethings in and other things out. In the same way, a definition encompasses some elements or aspects of a concept while excluding others. Which &#x201C;species&#x201D; of human communication is to be found inside the &#x201C;barnyard&#x201D; of persuasion depends on the size and shape of the fence a particular author builds. Fortunately, the differences in various definitions can be clarified, if not resolved, by focusing on two key considerations. We turn to these next.</p>
<sec id="sec2_1">
<title>Pure Versus Borderline Cases of Persuasion</title>
<p>The first consideration is whether one is interested in pure persuasion or borderline cases of persuasion. By <italic>pure persuasion</italic>, we mean clear-cut cases of persuasion, on which most people would agree. Everyone would agree that a presidential debate, or a television commercial, or an attorney&#x2019;s closing remarks to a jury are instances of persuasion. Such examples represent &#x201C;paradigm cases&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_39">O&#x2019;Keefe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_54">Simons, 1986</xref>) because they are at the core of what we think of when we envision persuasion at work. Other instances, though, lie closer to the boundary or periphery of what we normally think of as persuasion. These instances we refer to as <italic>borderline cases</italic> of persuasion. Not everyone would agree that a derelict&#x2019;s mere appearance &#x201C;persuades&#x201D; passersby to keep their distance. Nor would everyone agree that involuntary reflexes such as burps, blinking, and pupil dilation constitute &#x201C;persuasive&#x201D; phenomena. These cases are less clear-cut, more &#x201C;iffy.&#x201D; Much of the disparity in definitions is rooted in the fact that some authors are concerned with pure persuasion, whereas other authors are concerned with borderline cases as well. It isn&#x2019;t so much a matter of being right or wrong as it is a matter of how wide a net each author wishes to cast. The preliminary model of the scope of persuasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2_1">Figure 2.1</xref>) illustrates this distinction in approaches.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> As the shading in the model suggests, the dividing line between pure and borderline persuasion is fuzzy, rather than distinct.</p>

</fig>
<p>Although we don&#x2019;t think there is a single, correct definition of persuasion, we do think there are somethings that a functional, contemporary definition of persuasion ought to do. A contemporary definition should take into account the rich complex of verbal, nonverbal, and contextual cues found in interpersonal encounters. A contemporary definition also should acknowledge the many subtle, implicit cues that accompany face-to-face influence attempts. By implicit cues, we mean communication that occurs at a very low level of awareness, or even unconsciously. As an example, cultural factors might influence a person&#x2019;s choice of compliance-gaining strategies, without the person even realizing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_56">Wiseman et al., 1995</xref>). Such implicit communication is, in fact, quite common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_31">Langer, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_32">1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_33">1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_51">Roloff, 1980</xref>) and an important ingredient in persuasion. The definition and model of persuasion that we offer later in this chapter take these features into account.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2_2">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_33">33</target>Limiting Criteria for Defining Persuasion</title>
<p>A second consideration in defining persuasion involves the limiting criteria that form the basis for a given definition. Different scholars apply different litmus tests when defining persuasion. Five basic criteria can be gleaned from the various definitions offered in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_24">Gass &#x0026; Seiter, 2004</xref>). We examine each of these criteria in turn.</p>
<sec id="sec2_2_1">
<title>Intentionality</title>
<p>Is persuasion necessarily conscious or purposeful? Is there such a thing as &#x201C;accidental&#x201D; persuasion? Many who write about persuasion adopt a source-centered view by focusing on the sender&#x2019;s intent as a defining feature of persuasion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_40">Perloff (2013)</xref> adopts this view, stressing that &#x201C;persuasion does involve a deliberate attempt to influence another person. Persuaders must intend to change another individual&#x2019;s attitude or behavior and must be aware (at least at some level) that they are trying to accomplish this goal&#x201D; (p. 18). For some authors, intentionality is the litmus test that distinguishes <italic>persuasion</italic> from <italic>social influence</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_24">Gass &#x0026; Seiter, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Certainly, pure persuasion would seem to be intentional. When we think of obvious cases of persuasion we tend to think of situations in which one person purposefully tries to influence another. But what about borderline cases of persuasion? We believe that many influence attempts take place without any conscious awareness on the part of the persuader.</p>
<p>As just one instance, parents quite commonly instill beliefs, impart values, and model behavior for their children, a phenomenon known as <italic>social modeling</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_4">Bandura, 1977</xref>). Yet they may not realize how much of what they say and do is absorbed by their young-uns. As any parent will attest, many of the lessons parents &#x201C;teach&#x201D; their children are completely unintended. Another form of unintentional influence involves <target target-type="page" id="page_34">34</target><italic>socialization</italic> processes. From the moment children are born, they are socialized into their respective gender roles, cultural customs, religious practices, and socioeconomic habits. Some socialization processes are mindful, but many are not.</p>
<p>A second way in which an intent criterion is problematic is that people do not always know what specific outcome they are seeking. Face-to-face encounters, in particular, are laden with spontaneity. Social influence may arise in and through our interaction with others, rather than as a result of planning and forethought. Sometimes persuasion just happens.</p>
<p>A third problem with relying on an intent criterion involves situations in which there are unintended receivers. Imagine a scenario in which two people are discussing which bets to place on a horse race. One tells the other about an inside tip on a horse that&#x2019;s a &#x201C;sure thing.&#x201D; A third party overhears the conversation and places a wager on the horse. In such situations, persuaders don&#x2019;t intend for third parties to be influenced, yet they often are. Two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_25">Greenberg &#x0026; Pyszczynski, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_27">Kirkland, Greenberg, &#x0026; Pyszczynski, 1987</xref>) clearly demonstrate the operation of the <italic>unintended receiver effect</italic>. In these studies, the researchers created a situation in which third parties overheard an ethnic slur directed against an African American. The results of both studies revealed that the overheard ethnic slur led to lower evaluations by the third parties of the individual at whom the slur was directed. Notice that a reliance on an intent standard for defining persuasion tends to make senders less accountable for the consequences of their unintended communication. If a message has harmful effects, the source can disavow any responsibility by claiming &#x201C;that&#x2019;s not what I intended.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A fourth limitation lies in the difficulty of ascertaining another&#x2019;s intent. There can be a difference between a persuader&#x2019;s <italic>stated</italic> intent versus his or her <italic>actual</italic> intent. Who makes the determination in such cases? The sender? The receiver? A third party?</p>
<p>Finally, resolving the issue of intent is particularly difficult in interpersonal contexts, in which both parties may be engaged simultaneously in attempts at influence. When there are two interactants, whose intent counts? Intent-based definitions, we believe, are ill suited to modern conceptualizations of human interaction as a two-way venture. The linear view of persuasion that such definitions imply, from sender to receiver, ignores opportunities for mutual influence.</p>

<title>Effects</title>
<p>The effects criterion poses the question: Has persuasion taken place if no one is actually persuaded? Some authors adopt a receiver-oriented definition of persuasion by restricting its use to situations in which receivers are somehow changed, altered, or affected. Daniel O&#x2019;Keefe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_39">2016</xref>) underscores this perspective when he writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The notion of success is embedded in the concept of persuasion. Notice, for instance, that it doesn&#x2019;t make sense to say, &#x201C;I persuaded him, but failed.&#x201D; One can say, &#x201C;I <italic>tried</italic> to persuade him, but failed,&#x201D; but to say simply, &#x201C;I persuaded him&#x201D; is to imply a successful attempt to influence.</p>
<attrib>(pp. 2&#x2013;3)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although we recognize the attraction of this point of view, we believe there are problems with limiting the definition of persuasion in this way. We take the position <target target-type="page" id="page_35">35</target>that even if a person is communicating badly, he or she is <italic>still</italic> communicating. Similarly, we believe that a person can be engaged in persuasion even if it is <italic>ineffective</italic> persuasion. The same can be said for most other activities. A salesperson might fail to close a deal but would still be engaged in selling. A dancer might dance badly, stepping on his or her partner&#x2019;s toes, but would still be engaged in dancing. In short, a person can be engaged in an activity whether the person is doing it well or not.</p>
<p>An effects criterion emphasizes persuasion as a <italic>product</italic>. Such an orientation, however, bears little fidelity to current conceptualizations of human communication as a <italic>process</italic>. If we think of persuasion only as an outcome or a thing, then an effects orientation makes perfectly good sense. We maintain that persuasion is better understood as an activity in which people engage. This is more than semantic quibbling. By approaching persuasion as a process, scholars and researchers are more likely to gain insights into how it functions, or what makes it tick, because they are focusing on <italic>what&#x2019;s going on</italic>, not simply on how things turn out.</p>
<p>A second weakness is the same as that already associated with an intent criterion: An effects criterion embodies a linear view of persuasion, from source to receiver. In face-to-face encounters, however, there isn&#x2019;t simply <italic>a</italic> source and <italic>a</italic> receiver. Both parties may be simultaneously engaged in persuasion. They shape, adapt, and adjust their strategies in response to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_50">Prislin et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A third problem with relying on an effects criterion is that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to measure persuasive effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_52">Rotzoll and Haefner (1996)</xref>, for example, concluded that only 20 to 40 percent of advertising is effective. The other 60 to 80 percent is also persuasion&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just ineffective persuasion. In fact, the ability to measure persuasive outcomes may hinge entirely on the sensitivity of one&#x2019;s measuring instruments (scales, surveys, sales figures, etc.). Furthermore, what constitutes the threshold for a successful versus unsuccessful attempt at persuasion? How much attitude or behavior change must take place to say persuasion has occurred? And what about the occasional odd circumstance in which persuasion &#x201C;boomerangs&#x201D;&#x2014; that is, a persuader achieves an effect that is <italic>contrary</italic> to his or her intended purpose? Such questions, we believe, highlight the many vagaries inherent in relying on an effects criterion.</p>
<p>We do agree that, as with an intent criterion, pure cases of persuasion can usually be evaluated by their overall effectiveness. Even then, persuasion is rarely an all-or-nothing venture. If one also wishes to focus on borderline cases of persuasion, one must accept the fact that partial persuasion is more the rule than the exception. Notice, too, that there is some tension between relying on intent and effects as limiting criteria: What is achieved isn&#x2019;t always what is intended, and what is intended isn&#x2019;t always what is achieved.</p>

<title>Free Will and Conscious Awareness</title>
<p>Many authors endorse the view that there is a distinction between persuasion and coercion. This view is also receiver based, but it focuses on whether a person is aware that she or he is being persuaded and how much freedom the person has to accept or reject the message. Persuasion, these authors suggest, is noncoercive. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_54">Herbert Simons (1986)</xref> puts it, &#x201C;persuasion is a form of influence that predisposes, but does not impose&#x201D; (p. 22). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_40">Richard Perloff (2013)</xref> also makes this point when he states that persuasion requires &#x201C;an atmosphere of free choice&#x201D; (p. 27).</p>
<fig position="float">

</fig>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_36">36</target>It naturally follows that if a person is unaware that an influence attempt is taking place, she or he can&#x2019;t consciously resist it. Thus, mindfulness is a prerequisite for free choice. Nevertheless, we believe that persuasion can and does occur without the conscious awareness of receivers. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_2">Ackerman, Nocera, and Bargh (2010)</xref> found that evaluations of job applicants can be shaped in important yet unconscious ways. Participants in an experiment were asked to evaluate resumes of job applicants. Some participants read resumes attached to heavier clipboards, while others read resumes attached to lighter clipboards. The results were intriguing. Applicants whose resumes were attached to heavier clipboards were rated higher overall and as being more serious than their &#x201C;lightweight&#x201D; counterparts. The physical weight of the clipboards translated into judgments about whether the applicants themselves were more substantial. Our advice, if you want to be seen as having more &#x201C;gravitas&#x201D;: print your resume on a heavier bond of paper or, better yet, chisel it in stone.</p>
<p>In fact, many influence attempts succeed precisely because they operate at a low level of awareness. For example, consumers generally may be aware that product planting (placing products in movies and TV shows) is common, but they may not know how prevalent the practice is, let alone recognize each and every instance of product planting that occurs. Persuasion that relies on social networking, such as word of mouth (WOM), is designed to seem spontaneous rather than planned. A person might receive a link to a funny website from a friend, not realizing that the site was developed as a marketing tool by a commercial entity.</p>
<p>You may think of persuasion and coercion as being separate and distinct, but in our view, they aren&#x2019;t so much polar opposites as close relatives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_49">Powers (2007)</xref> agrees when she asks:
<disp-quote>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_37">37</target>Does a coercion claim have to show that another choice was in fact available? Just how available does the other choice have to be? Is it necessary to present all possible alternatives in order to avoid a charge of coercion? How equal do the choices have to be and how aware does the receiver have to be of those choices, and who decides what <italic>available</italic> means?</p>
<attrib>(p. 128)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In fact, we would suggest that most influence attempts we encounter in daily life include both persuasive and coercive elements. Rarely in life is one free to make a completely unfettered choice. There are almost always strings attached. This is particularly true of face-to-face encounters. If a friend asks to borrow 20 bucks, we can say &#x201C;no,&#x201D; but there may be relational consequences for declining.</p>
<p>Rarely, too, are influence attempts completely coercive. For example, holding a gun to another person&#x2019;s head would seem to be an obvious example of coercion. We readily admit that this situation is <italic>primarily</italic> coercive. But what if the victim doesn&#x2019;t believe the gun is loaded? Or what if the victim thinks the threatener is bluffing? To be successful, a threat&#x2014;even a threat of violence&#x2014;must be perceived as credible. Thus, even in what might seem like a clear-cut case of coercion there are persuasive elements at work. And conversely, even in what appear to be cut-and-dried cases of persuasion, there may be coercive features operating. In our view, the issue isn&#x2019;t so much <italic>whether</italic> a situation is persuasive or coercive as <italic>how</italic> persuasive or coercive the situation is.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2_2_4">
<title>Symbolic Action</title>
<p>A number of authors maintain that persuasion begins and ends with symbolic expression, which includes language as well as other meaning-laden acts, such as civil disobedience and protest marches. This approach focuses on the means, or channel, of persuasion as a limiting criterion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_7">Timothy Borchers (2013)</xref> endorses this view, noting that &#x201C;our definition of persuasion uses the phrase &#x2018;language strategies and/or other symbols&#x2019; to indicate the content of persuasion&#x201D; (p. 19). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_37">Gerald Miller (1980)</xref> maintains that &#x201C;in most instances, language is an integral aspect of the persuasive transaction&#x201D; (p. 5). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_40">Richard Perloff (2013)</xref> also adheres to this point of view, noting that &#x201C;Persuasion is a symbolic process&#x201D; (p. 17).</p>
<p>Authors who limit the scope of persuasion to symbolic action fear that without such a limitation, all human behavior could be construed as persuasion. Their point is well taken. However, restricting the medium for persuasion to words or symbols leads to a rather disjointed view of persuasion. We believe that a definition that limits persuasion to words and clearly codified symbols leaves out too much. Most magazine ads emphasize pictures rather than words. In fact, one study suggests that the text of a typical ad is read by fewer than 10 percent of the readers (Starch, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_19">Dupont, 1999</xref>). The same is true of television commercials. It seems arbitrary to limit persuasion to the words contained in an ad or a commercial, without considering the role of the images as well. We think that the <italic>whole</italic> ad or the <italic>whole</italic> commercial persuades.</p>
<p>We also believe that some of the most intriguing aspects of persuasion can be found in nonverbal behavior, which lies on the periphery of symbolic action. For example, research on the physiological correlates of deception demonstrates that <target target-type="page" id="page_38">38</target>a variety of involuntary nonverbal cues (such as blinking, smiling, and pupil dilation) are positive indicators of lying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_14">DePaulo, Stone, &#x0026; Lassiter, 1985</xref>). We focus on deception as a form of persuasion in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter12">Chapter 12</xref>. Research on source credibility reveals that physical attributes, such as height or attractiveness, influence judgments of source credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_10">Chaiken, 1979</xref>). We examine such factors in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter4">Chapter 4</xref>. We also can think of situations in which pure behavior&#x2014;for example, nonsymbolic actions&#x2014;are nevertheless persuasive. When a basketball player makes a head fake to fool a defender, we would maintain that the player is <italic>persuading</italic> the defender to go the wrong way. The fake is all behavior, but the player has to <italic>sell</italic> the fake to get the defender to &#x201C;bite&#x201D; on it.</p>
<p>We believe that restricting the study of persuasion exclusively to symbolic expression leads to a fragmented understanding of the subject. Persuasion involves more than language usage or symbol usage. A whole host of factors are at work. Interestingly, many authors who profess an adherence to symbolic action nevertheless treat a variety of nonsymbolic aspects of behavior, such as those just mentioned, in their texts.</p>

<sec id="sec2_2_5">
<title>Interpersonal Versus Intrapersonal</title>
<p>How many actors are required for persuasion to take place? A last limiting criterion that deserves mention is whether persuasion can involve only one person or whether persuasion requires the participation of two or more distinct persons. Some scholars adopt the view that engaging in persuasion is like dancing the tango: it takes two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_5">Bettinghaus &#x0026; Cody, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_26">Johnston, 1994</xref>). We agree in the case of the tango, but not in the case of persuasion. In fact, we maintain that attempts at self-persuasion are quite common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_3">Aronson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_40">Perloff, 2013</xref>). A person might search for a rationalization to do something he or she wants to do, such as blowing the rent money on front-row concert tickets. In such cases, people talk themselves into whatever they wish to do.</p>
<p>We are sympathetic to the &#x201C;two or more&#x201D; perspective but suggest that, once again, the issue comes down to whether one wishes to focus exclusively on pure cases of persuasion or borderline cases as well. We heartily agree that when we think of pure cases of persuasion, we conjure up an image of one person persuading another. When we include borderline cases, we imagine instances in which individuals sometimes try to convince themselves.</p>

<sec id="sec2_3">
<title>A Model of the Scope of Persuasion</title>
<p>In light of the five limiting criteria just discussed, we can now offer an enhanced model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2_3">Figure 2.3</xref>) that encompasses both pure and borderline cases of persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_24">Gass &#x0026; Seiter, 2004</xref>). As with the preliminary model, the inner circle represents pure persuasion&#x2014;that is, what we think of as the core of persuasion. The outer circle represents borderline persuasion. Superimposed on top of these two circles are five wedges, each representing one of the five limiting criteria previously discussed. The inner portion of each wedge represents the pure case for that criterion. The outer portion represents the borderline case. Once again, the shading between the inner and outer circles reflects the fuzzy dividing line that exists between pure and borderline persuasion.</p>
<fig id="fig2_3" position="float">
<label>Figure 2.3</label>
<caption><title>Enhanced model of persuasion.</title></caption>
<graphic orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fig2_3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_39">39</target>Based on this enhanced model, you can appreciate the fact that different definitions feature different wedges of the inner and outer circles. Source-oriented definitions restrict persuasion to the inner circle of the &#x201C;intentional&#x2013;unintentional&#x201D; wedge. Receiver-based definitions limit persuasion to the inner circle of the &#x201C;effects&#x2013;no effects&#x201D; wedge. Other receiver-based definitions favor the inner circle with respect to the &#x201C;free choice&#x2013;coercion&#x201D; criterion, and so on.</p>
<p>As you can also see from the enhanced model, some definitions concern themselves with several wedges at the same time, whereas other definitions are based on a single limiting criterion. It&#x2019;s worth noting that all definitions of persuasion&#x2014; including our own, which we present shortly&#x2014;are linguistic constructs. They exist in the world of words. Whether a given situation involves persuasion is not a matter of fact but of judgment.</p>
<p>Our own preference is for an expanded view of persuasion that includes borderline cases as well as pure persuasion. We tend to side with the view that persuasion is sometimes unintentional; that it sometimes has no discernible effects; that people aren&#x2019;t always aware of when it is occurring; that it often includes at least some coercive features; that it needn&#x2019;t be conveyed exclusively via symbols; and that humans do, on occasion, engage in self-persuasion. Many of the topics discussed in later chapters reside in the outer ring of our model. As we&#x2019;ve already indicated, we believe that some of the most intriguing aspects of persuasion can be found there. We firmly believe we must look at both the inner and outer rings to fully understand the phenomenon of persuasion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2_4">
<title>The Context for Persuasion</title>
<p>Consistent with current conceptualizations of persuasion, we view social influence as a process. Thus far, however, our model has remained relatively static. A final feature must be incorporated into our model to reflect the nature of persuasion as a process. <target target-type="page" id="page_40">40</target>That feature is the <italic>context</italic> for persuasion. The context in which persuasion occurs&#x2014; for example, within a small group, via mass media, in an organizational setting, and so forth&#x2014;is crucial because it is the context that determines the nature of the communication process. In a face-to-face setting, for example, influence is a mutual, two-way process. In an advertising setting, influence tends to be more linear, from the advertiser to the consumer (there may be feedback from consumers, but it is delayed). Each context imposes its own unique set of constraints on the options available to persuaders.</p>
<p>By context, we don&#x2019;t simply mean the number of communicators present, although that is certainly one key factor. The context for communication also includes how synchronous or asynchronous communication is. Synchronous communication refers to the simultaneous sending and receiving of messages. Such is the case in face-to-face interaction. Asynchronous communication refers to a back-and-forth process that involves some delay, such as email or texting.</p>
<p>Another contextual factor is the ratio of verbal to nonverbal cues that are present. A print ad consisting entirely of text would rely exclusively on verbal cues (words) to persuade. A poster featuring only an image would rely exclusively on nonverbal cues to persuade. Most persuasive messages involve both verbal and nonverbal cues. The ratio of verbal to nonverbal cues available in any persuasive situation imposes particular constraints on the persuasion process.</p>
<p>An additional contextual factor is the nature and type of media used in the persuasion process. Television commercials, radio ads, magazine ads, and telemarketing are traditional media for persuasion. New media include blogs, Face-book, Twitter, and YouTube, among many others. Face-to-face encounters, such as door-to-door sales and panhandling, are unmediated. As with the other contextual factors, each medium imposes its own constraints on the persuasion process.</p>
<p>Yet another contextual factor involves the goals of the participants. Often, but not always, participants enter into communication encounters with specific objectives in mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_15">Dillard, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_16">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_17">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_18">Dillard, Segrin, &#x0026; Harden, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_8">Canary and Cody (1994)</xref> break down these goals into three types&#x2014;self-presentational goals, relational goals, and instrumental goals. <italic>Self-presentational goals</italic> have to do with identity management. People want to project a favorable image of themselves to others. <italic>Relational goals</italic> have to do with what people want out of their relationships&#x2014; how to develop them, improve them, change them, and so forth. <italic>Instrumental goals</italic> involve attempts at compliance gaining. People&#x2019;s goals may be thwarted or may change during a persuasive encounter.</p>
<p>A final contextual variable involves sociocultural factors that affect the persuasion process. People from different cultures or subcultures may persuade and be persuaded in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_35">Ma &#x0026; Chuang, 2001</xref>). For example, research suggests that some cultures prefer more indirect approaches to compliance gaining (hinting, guilt, reliance on group norms), whereas other cultures prefer more direct approaches to compliance gaining (direct requests, demanding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_56">Wiseman et al., 1995</xref>). Different cultural traditions can dramatically affect what is expected or accepted in the way of influence attempts.</p>
<p>Note that all of these contextual factors are operating at once in a given persuasive situation. Each of the contextual factors constrains the process of persuasion in one way or another. The context involves the totality of the relationships among all these <target target-type="page" id="page_41">41</target>factors. The final version of our model, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2_4">Figure 2.4</xref>, illustrates how persuasion is shaped by context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_24">Gass &#x0026; Seiter, 2004</xref>). Context, then, is what determines the nature of the process involved in a given persuasive situation.</p>

<title>A Working Definition of Persuasion</title>
<p>At last we arrive at our own definition of persuasion. Our view is that <italic>persuasion involves one or more persons who are engaged in the activity of creating, reinforcing, modifying, or extinguishing beliefs, attitudes, intentions, motivations, and/or behaviors within the constraints of a given communication context</italic>. The advantage of our definition is that it encompasses the full scope of persuasion, both pure and borderline cases. Our definition also emphasizes persuasion as an activity or a process; it is something people do. Our definition encompasses the notion that in face-to-face encounters, persuasion is a two-way street. Each party has an opportunity to influence the other. With respect to our definition, we also wish to stress that persuasion doesn&#x2019;t involve simply changing one&#x2019;s own or another&#x2019;s mind, though that is the most typical connotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_37">Miller, 1980</xref>). Persuasion also can involve creating new beliefs or attitudes, where none existed before. It also can involve reinforcing, strengthening, or solidifying attitudes already held by receivers. And persuasion also can involve attempts to extinguish or eliminate beliefs and attitudes. The latter approach is exemplified by Alcoholics Anonymous&#x2019;s position that alcoholics must abandon the belief that other people are responsible, or circumstances are to blame, for their dependency.</p>
<p>If our definition seems expansive, it is because we believe the topic of persuasion itself is rather far ranging. We wish to examine not only the core of persuasion in this text but its periphery as well. The majority of our examples focus on pure cases of persuasion. However, from time to time we dabble on the fuzzy outer edges. We find some of the borderline cases of persuasion quite interesting, and we believe you will too.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2_6">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_42">42</target>So what isn&#x2019;t Persuasion?</title>
<p>Given the breadth of our definition, you&#x2019;re probably wondering, &#x201C;What <italic>isn&#x2019;t</italic> persuasion?&#x201D; We address this concern now. Our position is that the ingredients for persuasion can be found in most, if not all, communication transactions. The degree to which these persuasive ingredients are present is what matters. We think most human communication involves at least the <italic>potential</italic> to influence. Of course, one may choose not to focus on the persuasive, or potentially persuasive, elements in a communication situation. One can concentrate on some other aspect of communication instead. The potential for persuasion remains nonetheless. What matters, then, is how persuasive a given communication situation is, not whether a communication situation is persuasive.</p>
<p>Many other features of communication besides persuasion can command one&#x2019;s attention. For example, one can examine the role of self-disclosure and relationship satisfaction without discussing persuasion. One can study effective listening skills, regardless of whether the message listened to is persuasive or not. One can study nonverbal cues and liking without focusing on persuasion. One can look at how people try to save face during conflicts without involving persuasion. Persuasive elements needn&#x2019;t comprise the focus of attention even if they are present. One can focus on other relevant features of human communication to the exclusion of persuasive processes.</p>
<p>Although we believe that nearly all human communication is potentially persuasive, we don&#x2019;t believe the same about all human behavior. The mere act of breathing, in and of itself, doesn&#x2019;t seem like persuasion to us&#x2014;although under the right circumstances it could be (such as pretending to be out of breath). Tripping over a rock, by itself, doesn&#x2019;t seem like a persuasive act to us, although, again, under certain conditions it could be (such as feigning clumsiness). Biological functions, such as sneezing, coughing, or vomiting don&#x2019;t strike us as being persuasive, though, again, a person could fake having allergies, a cold, or a hangover to influence someone else. A good deal of human behavior, then, we don&#x2019;t consider to be persuasion, unless and until some additional conditions are met. We don&#x2019;t think everything humans do is persuasive.</p>
<p>There are also some forms of communication that we&#x2019;ve excluded from consideration in this text for purely practical reasons. We don&#x2019;t discuss torture as a form of persuasion, although some, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_1">Abbott (2016)</xref> call it persuasion at its most gruesome. We also don&#x2019;t address the possibility of human-to-animal persuasion, or vice versa, though such a case probably could be made. Furthermore, we don&#x2019;t consider a whole range of studies on how plants, such as willow trees or sugar maples, can warn other trees about insect infestations. There are biologists, though, who study &#x201C;talking trees&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_36">McGowan, 2013</xref>). We don&#x2019;t examine the power of hypnotic suggestion as a form of influence. We don&#x2019;t examine attempts to persuade via telepathy, paranormal, or psychic activity either. We&#x2019;ve heard that some people with cancerous tumors try to &#x201C;talk to&#x201D; their cancer and &#x201C;persuade&#x201D; it to go away. We don&#x2019;t deal with that topic here, except insofar as it may constitute a form of self-persuasion. We also don&#x2019;t address a host of other intriguing topics, such as the role of genetics and neuropsychology in persuasion. We simply don&#x2019;t have the space to devote <target target-type="page" id="page_43">43</target>to those topics here. Thus, as big as the fence that we&#x2019;ve built is, there is a lot of human communication we&#x2019;ve left out.</p>

<title>Dual Processes of Persuasion</title>
<p>Now that we&#x2019;ve clarified what we think persuasion is, we want to take a look at how it functions. To this end, we present a brief explanation of two prevailing models of persuasion. Both are known as <italic>dual process</italic> models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_13">Chaiken &#x0026; Trope, 1999</xref>) because they postulate that persuasion operates via two basic paths. The two models share many similarities and, in our opinion, both do an excellent job of explaining how persuasive messages are perceived and processed.</p>
<sec id="sec2_7_1">
<title>The Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion</title>
<p>Richard Petty and John Cacioppo&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_41">1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_42">1986b</xref>) <italic>elaboration likelihood model of persuasion</italic> (ELM), is one of the most widely cited models in the persuasion literature.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2_2"><sup>2</sup></xref> Their model proposes two basic routes to persuasion that operate in tandem. The first of these they call the <italic>central route</italic>. The central route, or <italic>central processing</italic>, as they sometimes refer to it, involves <italic>cognitive elaboration</italic>. That means thinking about the content of a message, reflecting on the ideas and information contained in it, and scrutinizing the evidence and reasoning presented. The second route to persuasion is known as the <italic>peripheral route</italic>. The peripheral route, or <italic>peripheral processing</italic>, as it is sometimes called, involves focusing on cues that aren&#x2019;t directly related to the substance of a message. For example, focusing on a source&#x2019;s physical attractiveness, or the sheer quantity of arguments presented, or a catchy jingle as a basis for decision making would entail peripheral processing. According to the ELM, the two routes represent the ends, or anchor points, of an elaboration continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_45">Petty, Rucker, Bizer, &#x0026; Cacioppo, 2004</xref>). At one end of the continuum, a person engages in no or low elaboration. At the other end, a person engages in high elaboration.</p>
<p>To illustrate the two basic routes, imagine that Rex and Trudy are on a date at a restaurant. Trudy is very health conscious, so she studies the menu carefully. She looks to see whether certain dishes are fatty or high in calories. When the food server arrives to take their order, she asks, &#x201C;What kind of oil is used to prepare the pasta?&#x201D; She might sound picky, but Trudy is engaging in central processing. She is actively thinking about what the menu says. Rex, however, is smitten with Trudy&#x2019;s good looks. He hardly looks at the menu, and when the food server asks for his order, he says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll have what she&#x2019;s having.&#x201D; Rex is engaging in peripheral processing. He&#x2019;s basing his decision on cues that are unrelated to the items on the menu.</p>
<p>Petty and Cacioppo acknowledge the possibility of <italic>parallel processing</italic>&#x2014;that is, using both routes at once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_44">Petty, Kasmer, Haugtvedt, &#x0026; Cacioppo, 2004</xref>). For example, when people judge the credibility of websites, they consider the look and layout of a website (peripheral cue) and the content of the website (central processing) (SanJos&#x00E9;-Cabezuo, Guti&#x00E9;rrez-Arranze, &#x0026; Guti&#x00E9;rrez-Cill&#x00E1;n, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_53">2009</xref>). However, Petty and Cacioppo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_41">1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_42">1986b</xref>) suggest that there is usually a trade-off between central and peripheral processing, such that a person tends to favor one route over the other. Whether a person emphasizes the central or the peripheral route hinges on two basic factors. The first of these is the individual&#x2019;s <italic>motivation</italic> to engage in central processing. Because central processing requires more mental effort, a person with greater <target target-type="page" id="page_44">44</target>motivation is more likely to rely on central processing. Typically, this means the person has <italic>high involvement</italic> with the topic or issue. That is, the topic or issue matters to him or her, or affects him or her personally. If a person has <italic>low involvement</italic> with a topic or issue, he or she will be less inclined to engage in central processing, and more likely to resort to peripheral processing. For example, voters with little knowledge are more likely to be swayed by politicians&#x2019; looks than voters who are informed about the candidates&#x2019; positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_34">Lenz &#x0026; Lawson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The second factor that determines whether a person will rely on central or peripheral processing is his or her <italic>ability</italic> to process information. A person must not only be willing but also able to engage in central processing. Some people are more adept at grasping ideas, understanding concepts, and making sense of things. Some people also have more knowledge of or expertise in certain topics or issues than others. Thus, receivers are more likely to process a persuasive message via the central route if they have the motivation and ability to do so. If they lack the motivation or the ability, they will tend to rely on peripheral processing instead.</p>
<p>Aside from ability and motivation, a variety of other factors can tilt the balance in favor of central or peripheral processing. These include distractions, such as background noise, time constraints, a person&#x2019;s mood, or a personality trait called <italic>need for cognition.</italic> Need for cognition has to do with how much a person enjoys thinking about things. We discuss this trait in more detail in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter5">Chapter 5</xref>.</p>

<p>The type of processing affects the persistence of persuasion. Researchers have found that persuasion via the central route tends to be more long lasting, whereas persuasion via the peripheral route tends to be more short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_9">Carpenter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_43">Petty, Haugtvedt, &#x0026; Smith, 1995</xref>). This seems sensible: When we think about ideas, <target target-type="page" id="page_45">45</target>they are more likely to be absorbed. Similarly, persuasion that takes place via central processing also tends to be more resistant to counterinfluence attempts than persuasion via peripheral processing. This also makes sense: If you&#x2019;ve thought through your position, you&#x2019;re less likely to &#x201C;waffle.&#x201D; Researchers also have found that if receivers disagree with the content of a message, using central processing causes them to generate more counterarguments. That is, they mentally rehearse their objections to the message. If receivers disagree with a message and rely on peripheral processing, however, they will generate fewer counterarguments or other unfavorable thoughts about the message. A useful generalization when persuading, then, is that to make persuasion last, you&#x2019;ve got to make people think.</p>

<sec id="sec2_7_2">
<title>The Heuristic Systematic Model of Persuasion</title>
<p>Another model of persuasion that bears many similarities to the ELM is Shelley Chaiken and Alice Eagly&#x2019;s <italic>heuristic systematic model</italic>, or HSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_11">Chaiken, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_12">Chaiken, Liberman, &#x0026; Eagly, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_13">Chaiken &#x0026; Trope, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_20">Eagly &#x0026; Chaiken, 1993</xref>). As with the ELM, the HSM operates on the assumption that individuals rely on two different modes of information processing. One mode, called <italic>systematic processing</italic>, is more thoughtful and deliberate. Systematic processing in the HSM is roughly analogous to central processing in the ELM. The other mode, called <italic>heuristic processing</italic>, relies on mental shortcuts. Heuristic processing is based on the application of <italic>decision rules</italic> or <italic>heuristic cues</italic> that help simplify the thought process. An example of a decision rule would be buying a TV based on its brand name (&#x201C;Sony televisions are reliable&#x201D;). An example of a heuristic cue would be choosing one wine over another because the bottle is prettier. Heuristic processing in the HSM is roughly equivalent to peripheral processing in the ELM.</p>
<p>Chaiken and Eagly&#x2019;s model also maintains that <italic>simultaneous processing</italic> of messages is commonplace. Messages travel the heuristic and systematic routes concurrently. As with the ELM, the HSM states that <italic>motivation</italic> and <italic>ability</italic> are two primary determinants of the extent to which heuristic or systematic processing will be used. A problem for both models is that, to date, there is limited empirical evidence of simultaneous processing, at least in laboratory studies of persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_6">Booth-Butterfield et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_12">Chaiken et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Another feature of the HSM is the <italic>sufficiency principle</italic>, which states that people strive to know as much as they need to when making a decision, but no more or less. On one hand, people want to devote the time and attention to issues that they deserve. On the other hand, people can&#x2019;t afford to spend all their time and mental energy worrying about every little thing. Therefore, people balance their heuristic and systematic processing to create the best &#x201C;fit&#x201D; for the issue at hand.</p>
<p>By way of illustration, suppose Irwin is thinking of buying a digital camera. If Irwin didn&#x2019;t know much about such devices, he could take one of two approaches. He could rely on systematic processing by reading up on digital cameras. He would likely adopt this route if he thought he really needed a digital camera (motivation) and he lacked the necessary knowledge about them (sufficiency principle). He also would need time to gather information and be able to understand it (ability). Alternatively, he could opt for heuristic processing. He could base his decision on a friend&#x2019;s advice using a simple decision rule (&#x201C;Lance knows his cameras&#x201D;) He could base his decision on a heuristic cue, such as the brand (&#x201C;Canon is the best brand&#x201D;). He would be more <target target-type="page" id="page_46">46</target>likely to resort to heuristic processing if he didn&#x2019;t really need a digital camera&#x2014;it was only an electronic toy (low motivation)&#x2014;or if he didn&#x2019;t think he could make sense of the information about cameras anyway (lack of ability).</p>

<p>Both the ELM and HSM are useful for explaining and predicting people&#x2019;s reactions to persuasive messages. Literally dozens of studies devoted to testing the explanatory and predictive power of these two models have been conducted. These studies have generally upheld the models&#x2019; utility. Although both models have their critics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_29">Kruglanski &#x0026; Thompson, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_30">1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_38">Mongeau &#x0026; Stiff, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_55">Stiff &#x0026; Boster, 1987</xref>), it is safe to say that they enjoy considerable support in the literature. We develop and amplify principles related to the ELM and HSM throughout this text. Because we refer to both models repeatedly, it would be worth your while to familiarize yourself with their basic concepts for later reference.</p>

<title>The Unimodel of Persuasion</title>
<p>An alternative to dual process models of persuasion is the <italic>unimodel</italic> developed by Arie Kruglanski and Erik Thompson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_29">Kruglanski &#x0026; Thompson, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_30">1999b</xref>). Kruglanski and Thompson posit that, rather than two distinct modes of information processing, there is a single route to persuasion. Central processing isn&#x2019;t qualitatively different from peripheral processing, according to the <italic>unimodel</italic>; there is simply more or less of it. Kruglanski maintains that the alleged differences in processing based on the ELM and HSM merely reflect differences in the messages themselves. Longer, more complex messages require more thought, while shorter, simpler messages require less thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_21">Erb, Pierro, Mannetti, Spiegel, &#x0026; Kruglanski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_28">Kruglanski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_48">Pierro, Mannetti, Erb, Spiegel, &#x0026; Kruglanski, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the simplicity of the <italic>unimodel</italic>, we believe there are cases in which persuasive messages are processed in fundamentally different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_47">Petty, Wheeler, &#x0026; Bizer, 1999</xref>). <target target-type="page" id="page_47">47</target>For example, a consumer who responded to a fear appeal emotionally or reflexively would be quite different from a consumer who responded to a fear appeal rationally or reflectively. Even so, the <italic>unimodel</italic> raises important questions about whether and how dual processing occurs. Some scholars have questioned whether dual processing has ever been empirically documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2_6">Booth-Butterfield et al., 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>We began this chapter by presenting a preliminary model of persuasion that distinguishes pure from borderline cases of persuasion. We identified five limiting criteria for defining persuasion that are reflected in our own model of persuasion. We followed our model with our own broad-based, far-reaching definition of persuasion. Finally, we provided a brief explanation of Petty and Cacioppo&#x2019;s <italic>elaboration likelihood model</italic> (ELM) of persuasion and Chaiken and Eagly&#x2019;s <italic>heuristic systematic model</italic> (HSM) of persuasion. An alternative to dual-process models, the <italic>unimodel</italic>, also was presented.</p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_52">52</target>IF SOMEONE SAID, &#x201C;Mabel has an attitude,&#x201D; you might think she was being irritable. However, the word <italic>attitude</italic> doesn&#x2019;t have the same meaning for social scientists that it does in everyday parlance. Social scientists have long been fascinated with the study of attitudes on all manner of subjects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_79">Prislin and Crano (2008)</xref> went so far as to say that social scientists have carried on an &#x201C;unremitting romance with attitudes over the past half-century&#x201D; (p. 3). The honeymoon isn&#x2019;t over. Attitudes remain a vital element in understanding how persuasion works today.</p>
<p>Just why are attitudes so important to understanding persuasion? The reason is that attitudes help to predict, explain, and modify behavior. Just as a baker uses yeast as a catalyst in baking bread, persuaders rely on attitudes as a means of bringing about changes in receivers. An understanding of attitudes is, therefore, a key ingredient in any recipe for persuasion. For this reason, this chapter is devoted to a discussion of attitudes. We begin by considering what an attitude is.</p>
<sec id="sec3_1">
<title>What is an &#x201C;Attitude&#x201D; in 20 Words or Less?</title>
<p>There is now general agreement among social scientists that an attitude is a &#x201C;psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a particular entity with some degree of favor or disfavor&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_22">Eagly &#x0026; Chaiken, 1993</xref>, p. 1). Let&#x2019;s examine some key aspects of this definition more closely. First, attitudes reflect <italic>tendencies</italic> or <italic>predispositions</italic> to respond to things in predictable ways. We don&#x2019;t have time to reflect on each and every action we take in life, so attitudes provide us with mental templates that guide our behavior.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there is a one-to-one correspondence between attitudes and behaviors. A person may have a favorable attitude toward losing weight but may not stay on a diet. To a large extent, though, our attitudes do correspond with our behaviors. For example, people who favor gun-control laws are less likely to own guns than people who oppose such laws. Attitudes have been shown to predict environmental behavior, consumer behavior, voting behavior, contraceptive use, marijuana use, discrimination based on race, and numerous other behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_45">Holland, Verplanken, &#x0026; van Krippenberg, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A second feature of attitudes is that they represent favorable or unfavorable evaluations of things. This <italic>evaluative dimension</italic> is, perhaps, the most central feature <target target-type="page" id="page_53">53</target>of attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_21">Dillard, 1993</xref>). If a person says, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t stand Marmite&#x201D; or &#x201C;I love Vegemite,&#x201D; the person is expressing his or her attitudes toward the two sandwich spreads. Along with their valence, attitudes <italic>vary in degree or intensity</italic>. Not all attitudes are equal. Stronger attitudes, whether positive or negative, tend to be better predictors of behavior and less subject to change.</p>
<p>A third aspect of attitudes is that they are always directed toward an <italic>attitude object.</italic> Attitudes may be held in memory or formed on the spot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_4">Argyriou &#x0026; Melawar, 2011</xref>), but people hold attitudes <italic>about</italic> things or <italic>toward</italic> things. The attitude object can be another person, an idea, a policy, an event, or a situation. Attitudes toward a complex issue may be composed of multiple attitudes toward a variety of sub-issues.</p>

<title>So how Do You Measure the Durn Things?</title>
<p>If you want to know how much you weigh, you can stand on a scale. If you want to know how tall you are, you can use a tape measure. But what if you want to measure someone&#x2019;s attitudes? Attitudes can&#x2019;t be observed directly. They are inside people&#x2019;s heads. As such, social scientists have developed a number of methods&#x2014;both <italic>explicit</italic> and <italic>implicit</italic>&#x2014;for measuring attitudes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Let&#x2019;s take a look at each of these approaches.</p>

<title>Explicit Measures: Self-Report Scales</title>
<p>The old saying, &#x201C;Straight from the horse&#x2019;s mouth&#x201D; suggests that whatever is being shared comes directly from the source. With that in mind, <italic>self-report scales</italic> might be thought of as &#x201C;straight-from-the-horse&#x2019;s-mouth&#x201D; measures. That&#x2019;s because self-report scales measure attitudes by directly asking people to reveal their attitudes. Because people know their attitudes are being measured, self-reports are considered to be <italic>explicit measures</italic> of attitudes (Petty, Fazio, &#x0026; Bri&#x00F1;ol, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_76">2009</xref>). Two widely used self-report scales are <italic>Likert</italic> scales and <italic>semantic differential</italic> scales.</p>
<sec id="sec3_3_1">
<title>Likert Scales</title>
<p>Rensus Likert&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_59">1932</xref>) &#x201C;equal appearing interval&#x201D; scales are among the most popular in use today. You&#x2019;ve probably already completed a number of them yourself. A Likert scale consists of a series of statements about some attitude object, followed by a continuum of choices ranging from &#x201C;strongly agree&#x201D; to &#x201C;strongly disagree&#x201D; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3_1">Figure 3.1</xref>). A respondent&#x2019;s attitude is represented by the average of his or her responses to all the statements in the scale. The scales are easy to construct and administer and enjoy widespread acceptance in academia, government, and industry.</p>

<sec id="sec3_3_1_1">
<title>Semantic Differential Scales</title>
<p>Although its name may be unfamiliar, you are probably already acquainted with the <italic>semantic differential</italic> scale (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3_2">Figure 3.2</xref>), developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_70">Osgood, Tannenbaum, and Suci (1957)</xref>. This scale is based on the <italic>connotative</italic> meanings that words have for people. It consists of a series of bipolar adjective pairs or, more simply, opposites, such as light&#x2013;dark, fast&#x2013;slow, happy&#x2013;sad, and so on. In completing the scale, a respondent checks the &#x201C;semantic&#x201D; space between each adjective pair that best reflects his or her overall attitude toward the concept in question. The respondent&#x2019;s overall attitude is represented by the average of the spaces checked on all of the items.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_54">54</target>Visually Oriented Scales</title>
<p>Other visually oriented methods of measuring attitudes via self-reports also have been developed. Visual scales make it easier for respondents to conceptualize their attitudes, because they can &#x201C;see&#x201D; where their attitudes fit on a scale or continuum. The <italic>visual analog scale</italic> or VAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_33">Flynn, van Schaik, &#x0026; van Wersch, 2004</xref>), for example, simply asks respondents to place a mark along a continuum. A Web tool for creating such a scale can be found at <uri>www.vasgenerator.net</uri> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_81">Reips &#x0026; Funke, 2008</xref>). Other visual scales include simple drawings of facial expressions. The expressions represent different degrees of favor or disfavor toward the attitude object, ranging from smiling to frowning (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3_3">Figure 3.3</xref>).</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_55">55</target>Pitfalls in Measuring Attitudes</title>
<p>Although explicit measures are fairly easy to administer, they have drawbacks. A reliance on self-reports presumes that people are aware of their attitudes and that they are willing and able to report them. One limitation of self-reports is known as <italic>social desirability bias</italic>. When people know that their words or actions are on display, they may exhibit what they perceive to be socially acceptable norms of conduct. During a job interview, for example, a person might express &#x201C;politically correct&#x201D; attitudes to win favor with the interviewer.</p>
<p>A second pitfall involves the problem of <italic>non-attitudes.</italic> People don&#x2019;t want to appear uninformed or unintelligent. So quite often, when they are asked for their attitude on a particular issue, they simply make one up&#x2014;on the spot! They fear that saying &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; or &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care&#x201D; will make them look uninformed. For example, when late-night host Jimmy Kimmel asked passersby who won a &#x201C;First Lady/Man&#x201D; debate between Bill Clinton and Melania Trump, a number of people expressed strong opinions. No such debate ever took place, however (<uri>www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG8lVhyWPmI</uri>).</p>
<p>A third drawback has to do with <italic>mindfulness.</italic> In order for a person to mark the space on any self-report measure, the person must be aware of what his or her attitude is. Unfortunately, respondents often, quite literally, don&#x2019;t know their own minds. For example, a person could harbor racist, sexist, or homophobic attitudes, without consciously realizing it.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_56">56</target>Implicit Measures: What&#x2019;s Rattling Around Inside Your Brain? To avoid the pitfalls just described, social scientists utilize <italic>implicit measures</italic> of attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_35">Goodall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_95">Wittenbrink &#x0026; Schwartz, 2007</xref>). Such measures assume that unconscious attitudes can be accessed, thereby reducing conscious bias on the part of respondents (Petty, Fazio, &#x0026; Bri&#x00F1;ol, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_76">2009</xref>). We discuss these measures next.</p>
<sec id="sec3_3_3_1">
<title>Implicit Association Test (IAT)</title>
<p>The best known implicit measure is the <italic>Implicit Association Test</italic> or IAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_37">Greenwald, McGhee, &#x0026; Schwartz, 1998</xref>). Respondents are asked to press keys on a computer key board in a series of rapid-fire word-association tasks. The snap judgments reveal their underlying attitudes. To illustrate, let&#x2019;s say you wanted to find out whether managers harbor negative stereotypes toward employees with disabilities. On the IAT, managers with negative attitudes would be faster at classifying word pairs, such as &#x201C;disabled/unpleasant&#x201D; or &#x201C;able-bodied/happy&#x201D; compared to word pairs, like &#x201C;disabled/pleasant&#x201D; or &#x201C;able bodied/sad&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_94">Wilson &#x0026; Scior, 2014</xref>). The speed at which respondents press the keys signifies the strength of association for their stereotypes. Variations of the IAT have been developed to measure implicit attitudes toward gender, age, weight, religion, race, disability, and many other topics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3_3_3_2">
<title>Other Implicit Measures</title>
<p>A variety of other implicit measures have been developed, including the <italic>affect misattribution procedure</italic> or AMP and <italic>evaluative priming</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_25">Fabrigar, Krosnick, &#x0026; MacDougall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_27">Fazio &#x0026; Olson, 2003</xref>). We don&#x2019;t have sufficient space to examine them all here. What all these measures have in common, though, is that they tap into attitudes that people may be unable or unwilling to divulge. Not surprisingly, implicit measures do not always produce the same results as explicit measures, prompting some to ask, &#x201C;So which is the <italic>real</italic> attitude?&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_38">Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, &#x0026; Banaji, 2009</xref>). The answer is both. For judgments that are made reflexively or impulsively, implicit measures tend to be more reliable. For judgments that are made more thoughtfully or deliberately, explicit measures tend to yield better results.</p>

<sec id="sec3_3_4">
<title>More Roundabout Ways of Measuring Attitudes</title>
<p>In addition to explicit and implicit measures, a variety of other, less scientific means can be used to infer people&#x2019;s attitudes. These include inferring attitudes from appearances, from associations, and from behavior.</p>
<sec id="sec3_3_4_1">
<title>Judging a Book by Its Cover&#x2014;Appearances</title>
<p>Attitudes may be inferred from appearances. In fact, people do this all the time. Take, for example, the ability to spot homosexuals, known by the slang term <italic>gaydar</italic>. In controlled studies, observers were able to judge the sexual orientation of females and males at greater than chance odds, based on facial cues, posture, gestures, and gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_83">Rule, Ambady, &#x0026; Hallett, 2009</xref>). As another example, observers correctly guessed which political parties candidates belonged to, based solely on photographs, at a much higher rate than chance would predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_82">Rule &#x0026; Ambady, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_84">Rule, Ambady, Adams, &#x0026; Macrae, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_57">57</target>The danger of relying on such appearance-based cues, however, is that the person may commit a &#x201C;sweeping generalization.&#x201D; Not every black teen wearing a hoodie is a thug, nor is every white teen with a shaved head a skinhead.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3_3_4_2">
<title>Birds of a Feather&#x2014;Associations</title>
<p>&#x201C;You can tell a person,&#x201D; so the saying goes, &#x201C;by the company he or she keeps.&#x201D; A person who enjoys hunting, for example, may well belong to the NRA. A cancer survivor might participate in a bike ride for the Livestrong Foundation. It makes sense that people enter careers, join organizations, and establish affiliations with groups of like-minded people. Politicians rely on the fact that people who share similar attitudes tend to form memberships. This enables politicians to curry favor with &#x201C;voting blocs.&#x201D;</p>
<p>How does all of this relate to persuasion? By knowing that members of unions, professional associations, churches, and other organizations tend to share similar attitudes, politicians can tailor their messages to each group&#x2019;s frame of reference. Marketers use a technique called <italic>segmentation analysis</italic> to target their advertising campaigns to specific groups of consumers, such as soccer moms, NASCAR dads, or Millennials. We focus more on this topic in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter5">Chapter 5</xref>.</p>
<p>Note that the approach of inferring attitudes based on associations is not without limitations. People may join organizations for all kinds of reasons, some of which have little or nothing to do with the group&#x2019;s avowed purpose. We know of a &#x201C;fun run,&#x201D; for example, that was created to celebrate health and individuality. We also know someone planning to run it. Why? There&#x2019;s a unicorn medal awarded at the finish line.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_58">58</target>You Are What You Do&#x2014;Behavior</title>
<p>Inferences about other people&#x2019;s attitudes are often based on brief glimpses or &#x201C;thin slices&#x201D; of their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_3">Ambady, 2010</xref>). A person&#x2019;s overt actions, mannerisms, habits, and nonverbal cues can be used to infer his or her attitudes. If a person participates in a &#x201C;Resistance March,&#x201D; it&#x2019;s a pretty good indication that he or she holds anti-Trump attitudes. If a person buys season tickets to the philharmonic orchestra, it&#x2019;s a fairly safe bet that he or she likes classical music. Indeed, concealing one&#x2019;s attitudes can be difficult, precisely because one&#x2019;s actions tend to give one away. Actions speak louder than words, as the saying goes.</p>
<p>Of course, inferring attitudes from behavior can be fraught with difficulties. A meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_54">Kim &#x0026; Hunter, 1993</xref>) of more than 100 attitude&#x2013;behavior studies sheds some light on the extent to which attitudes reflect behavior and vice versa. Kim and Hunter found that in many cases, researchers made poor choices about which attitudes to examine in relation to particular behaviors. They found that when the attitude measures employed were <italic>truly relevant to the behaviors in question,</italic> attitude&#x2013;behavior consistency (ABC) was quite high. Past studies that found weaker ABC may have been looking at the wrong attitudes. The bottom line is that behavior can be extremely revealing of attitudes, but care must be exercised in determining which attitudes are germane to which behaviors. Some ways of improving ABC are identified in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box3_1">Box 3.1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec3_3_5">
<title>Physiological Measures of Attitude</title>
<p>Affect or emotion is often accompanied by physiological reactions. To date, however, efforts to identify biological markers of affect have produced &#x201C;iffy&#x201D; results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_25">Fabrigar, Krosnick, &#x0026; MacDougall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_72">Petty &#x0026; Cacioppo, 1983</xref>). Researchers have studied pupil dilation, which can signify arousal and galvanic skin response (GSR), which measures changes in the electrical conductivity of the skin. The problem with these measures is that they are <italic>bi-directional indicators</italic> of attitude, meaning that they can signal positive <italic>or</italic> negative responses. For example, your heart rate might increase upon seeing someone you like, a positive reaction, or upon seeing someone you dislike, a negative reaction.</p>
<p>Micromomentary facial movements have also been examined as signs of emotion. Such movements are involuntary and last for only a fraction of a second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_77">Porter &#x0026; ten Brink, 2008</xref>). They are, therefore, hard to detect. Furthermore, although microexpressions indicate that an emotion is being suppressed, they don&#x2019;t reveal what emotion or why (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_17">Ciolacu, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, researchers have turned to neuroscience to study attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_15">Cacioppo, Cacioppo, &#x0026; Petty, 2017</xref>). Through the use of techniques such as <italic>functional magnetic resonance imaging</italic> (fMRI), neural activity in different regions of the brain can reveal different reactions to stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_14">Cacioppo, Berntson, &#x0026; Decety, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_26">Falk, Berman, Mann, Harrison, &#x0026; Lieberman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_62">McDermott, 2009</xref>). While offering considerable promise as a tool for measuring attitudes, however, fMRI is not there yet (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_52">Jack &#x0026; Appelbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_92">Tingley, 2006</xref>). One neuroimaging study of swing voters, for example, predicted the wrong candidates as the likely winners in the 2008 presidential election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_51">Iacoboni et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_66">Mind Games, 2007</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>When Do Attitudes Coincide With Behavior?</title></caption>
<p>Just because a moviegoer tends to prefer action-adventure movies over comedies doesn&#x2019;t mean that he or she will always insist on seeing the former instead of the latter. So when can we expect attitudes to coincide with behavior? There tends to be greater attitude-behavior consistency (ABC) when:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Stronger as opposed to weaker attitudes are involved. Stronger attitudes are better predictors of behavior. When attitudes are weaker, people may use the reverse approach; they infer their attitudes from their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_45">Holland, Verplanken, &#x0026; Van Knippenberg, 2002</xref>). If a woman&#x2019;s last three boyfriends had long hair, she might decide, &#x201C;I guess I like shaggy guys.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Multiple attitudes aren&#x2019;t confused with single attitudes. A person doesn&#x2019;t have one attitude toward &#x201C;immigrants,&#x201D; for example. Immigrants from one country might be preferred over those from another country. ABC is greater when a single attitude is measured within a specific situation, place, and time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x201C;Multiple act criteria&#x201D; are employed. Giving people different opportunities to manifest their attitudes improves the &#x201C;fit&#x201D; between attitudes and behavior. One-shot measures aren&#x2019;t as reliable. If you want to assess a person&#x2019;s attitudes toward homeless people, for example, you should examine her or his behavior toward more than one homeless person in more than one setting.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The attitudes are based on personal experience. Attitudes formed as a result of direct personal experience tend to correspond more closely with actual behavior. Secondhand attitudes, shaped by the media or based on what others have told us, do not predict behavior as well.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attitudes that are central to the belief system are involved. Attitudes that are central to a person&#x2019;s core beliefs tend to be better predictors of behavior than attitudes that are tangential to the person&#x2019;s belief system. A person&#x2019;s attitudes about &#x201C;marital fidelity&#x201D; would be more revealing of his or her behavior in relationships than his or her preferences regarding pineapple on pizza.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attitude certainty is high. The more certain a person is about the correctness of an attitude, the greater the effect on the person&#x2019;s behavior. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_93">Tormala and Rucker (2015)</xref> note:
<disp-quote>
<p>people who are certain of their beliefs are more likely to buy, buy sooner, and spend more. They&#x2019;re more likely to sign petitions and to vote. They&#x2019;re more willing to express their opinions, endorse products, advocate for causes, and try to persuade others to adopt their views.</p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_60">60</target>Bear in mind that the more complex the attitudes are, the more difficult the task of reducing them to purely physiological terms. At present, physiological measures appear to be less reliable, and more difficult to administer, than other &#x201C;low-tech&#x201D; measures of attitude.</p>

<title>The Reasoned Action Approach (RAA)</title>
<p>Up to this point, we&#x2019;ve seen that attitudes often lead to behaviors. That said, there are other factors involved. To illustrate, consider Martin Fishbein and Icek Ajzen&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_32">2010</xref>) <italic>reasoned action approach</italic> (RAA), which views <italic>intention</italic> as the best predictor of behaviour. That is, a person&#x2019;s intention to perform a behavior is the best indicator of whether or not the person will actually carry out the behavior. Keep in mind, however, that intentions don&#x2019;t always correspond with behavior, as anyone who has set an alarm clock for an early wake up, then hit the snooze button, well knows. One way to improve the correspondence between intention and behavior is to be specific about the behavior in question. Thus, rather than asking whether someone intends to exercise more often, you could ask whether he or she intends to walk more often. Better yet, you could ask whether he or she intends to walk at least 20 minutes per day, three days per week, starting next Monday, which is more specific still. Bottom line? The more specific the intention is to a particular behavior, the more accurate your prediction will be.</p>
<sec id="sec3_4_1">
<title>Behavioral Beliefs and Attitudes: Believe It or Not</title>
<p>Not only that, your accuracy will improve even more if you can figure out what forms a person&#x2019;s intentions. According to the reasoned action approach, three key elements are involved. The first is a person&#x2019;s <italic>behavioral beliefs and attitudes</italic>. Suppose you wanted to convince your friend, Minnie, to wear a helmet when riding her bicycle. You could start by discovering her beliefs and attitudes toward wearing a helmet. Is she aware of specific dangers? Does she believe that helmets can protect her? You may have to convince Minnie that cyclists are at risk and that wearing a helmet is essential to her safety. &#x201C;I care more about your brain than your hair,&#x201D; you might say. &#x201C;Besides, if you&#x2019;re a vegetable, you&#x2019;ll have bed head anyway.&#x201D;</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3_4_2">
<title>Normative Beliefs: It&#x2019;s What the Cool Kids Are Doing</title>
<p>Second, <italic>normative beliefs</italic>, based on what significant others think or do, also shape intentions. Two types of normative beliefs are involved. <italic>Descriptive norms</italic> refer to what people generally or typically do. Does Minnie think helmet wearing is a common practice among her friends, family, or cyclists in general? <italic>Injunctive norms</italic>, on the other hand, refer to what people should or ought to do. Does she face social pressure to wear a helmet, or conversely, social sanctions for wearing one? If Minnie perceives that her friends think helmets are dorky, you may have to convince her otherwise. You might point out that professional cyclists, snowboarders, or BMX riders, look snazzy when sporting a helmet. &#x201C;Hey,&#x201D; you might say, &#x201C;Matt Damon, an avid cyclist, always dons a helmet. So do Jake Gyllenhaal and Pink. Daft Punk wear helmets when they aren&#x2019;t even riding!&#x201D;</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3_4_3">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_61">61</target>Perceived Behavioral Control: I Got This</title>
<p>The third element in forming intentions is <italic>perceived behavioral control</italic>. Behavioral control involves a person&#x2019;s confidence that she or he is capable of performing a given behavior. Wearing a helmet isn&#x2019;t that difficult, but Minnie may need help picking one out and making sure it fits. Some behaviors, like riding 100 miles on a bike, are harder to perform. Minnie might want to do a centennial ride, but she may believe that she is not capable of riding that far. You might have to convince her that she can build up to a longer ride. You could tell her &#x201C;Try a 20 mile ride. As you build up your stamina, you can go for longer rides. All it takes is willpower.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In combination, these three elements, behavioral and attitudinal beliefs, normative beliefs, and perceived behavior control, shape a person&#x2019;s behavioral intention, which, in turn, guides his or her behavior (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3_5">Figure 3.5</xref>). The stronger the intention, the more likely a person is to perform a given behavior. A few qualifications to the RAA are worth mentioning. First, past behavior strengthens the intention&#x2013;behavior correlation. In other words, if a person has already performed a behavior, like donating to a specific charity, it is more likely that she or he will perform it again. Second, <italic>actual control</italic>, not just perceived behavior control, matters too. A person may overestimate or underestimate her or his ability to perform a behavior. Despite the best intentions, for example, not every yoga enthusiast can do an Eka Hasta Vrksasana (one-handed tree pose) or a Pungu Mayurasana (wounded peacock pose). These caveats notwithstanding, the RAA has proven to be reliable and accurate in predicting intentions and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_31">Fishbein, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_62">62</target>The Persistence of Attitudes</title>
<p>A final feature of attitudes we wish to address is their persistence. Attitudes are malleable and change over time. They aren&#x2019;t as fleeting as moods or emotions, but neither are they etched in stone. Sometimes a person&#x2019;s attitude will change in response to a single, brief exposure to a persuasive message. Sometimes a person&#x2019;s attitude will endure for years. What makes some attitudes so durable and others so transitory?</p>
<p>Petty and Cacioppo&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_73">1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_74">1986b</xref>) <italic>elaboration likelihood model</italic> (ELM), discussed in the previous chapter, provides a useful answer to this question. Attitudes formed via central processing&#x2014;for example, those involving thought and deliberation&#x2014;are more persistent and resistant to change than attitudes formed via peripheral processing, which rely on mental shortcuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_75">Petty, Cacioppo, Strathman, &#x0026; Priester, 2005</xref>). The reason is because actively thinking about an issue seems to &#x201C;plant&#x201D; the attitude more firmly. Because peripheral processing requires little mental effort, attitudes formed as a result of peripheral processing tend to be more short-lived.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3_2"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
<p>What does this mean for you as a persuader? If you want a message to have a lasting effect on receivers&#x2019; attitudes, you should design and deliver it in such a way as to promote central processing (i.e., active thinking). How can you encourage central processing? Increasing receivers&#x2019; involvement is one way of promoting central processing. Explaining why a topic or issue is relevant to receivers and how it affects them personally will increase their <italic>motivation</italic> to use central processing. Adapting your message to the receivers&#x2019; levels of understanding will increase their <italic>ability</italic> to engage in central processing. In short, if you can get your listeners to actively think about your message, you are more likely to change their attitudes for the long term, not just the short term.</p>

<title>Attitudes as Associate Networks: Your Mind is a Web</title>
<p>Our attitudes are interrelated. In some ways, our attitudes, beliefs, and values can be likened to a spider&#x2019;s web. Like the fine silky threads of a spider&#x2019;s web, they are connected to one another in a delicate balance. Attitudes, therefore, exist in elaborate <italic>associative networks</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_91">Tesser &#x0026; Shaffer, 1990</xref>). An individual may or may not be consciously aware of all these connections. To a large extent, these associative networks operate implicitly&#x2014;that is, without the individual&#x2019;s conscious awareness. A change in one attitude affects other attitudes, beliefs, opinions, and values. Like jiggling a spider&#x2019;s web, a vibration in one attitude can trigger reverberations in other cognitive structures. These mental reverberations may be quite minor, or they can be of major consequence to the individual.</p>

<sec id="sec3_7">
<title>Manufacturing Favorable Associations: Jiggling the Web</title>
<p>Why would anyone buy automobile insurance from a company whose spokesperson is an animated gecko with an Aussie accent? Or, for that matter, why would anyone buy a laundry detergent because its logo is emblazoned on a race car? The associative networks in which attitudes exist are critical to such influence attempts. Persuaders actively seek to create connections among these networks. They want to link their messages with favorable attitudes and avoid associations with unfavorable attitudes.</p>
<sec id="sec3_7_1">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_63">63</target>Brands and Branding: That&#x2019;s the Life</title>
<p>A clear case of manufacturing favorable associations can be found in <italic>branding</italic>. The point of branding is to create a distinctive product image that is linked to favorable qualities. These may be tangible or intangible in nature. Different brands conjure up different images in the minds of consumers. Walmart&#x2019;s appeal is based on value or low prices. Nordstrom&#x2019;s appeal is based on quality and customer service.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s examine how these associations are created. Consider the energy drink Red Bull. When you think of Red Bull, what associations come to mind? Do you think of speed, danger, or risk taking? One study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_9">Brasel &#x0026; Gips, 2011</xref>) found that consumers used descriptors such as <italic>hyper</italic>, <italic>speed</italic>, <italic>extreme</italic>, and <italic>dangerous</italic> in relation to the energy drink. A look at the kinds of events Red Bull sponsors helps explain why. Red Bull sponsors &#x201C;extreme&#x201D; sports, such as adventure racing, mountain biking, cliff diving, and other &#x201C;gravity&#x201D; sports. If downhill &#x201C;street luging&#x201D; is your thing, you might want to down a Red Bull beforehand. Thanks to branding, the drink &#x201C;goes with&#x201D; the sport.</p>
<p>As another illustration, consider beer commercials. The spots almost always depict people, usually males, in pairs or groups (never drinking alone) socializing and having a good time. What is the image or association the ads are projecting? <italic>Beer</italic> = <italic>fun.</italic> It&#x2019;s a simple formula. Drinking beer is equated with good times and camaraderie. So strong is the association that some people might find it hard to imagine a Super Bowl Sunday <target target-type="page" id="page_64">64</target>party, St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day gathering, <italic>Cinco de Mayo</italic> celebration, Labor Day shindig, or Fourth of July revelry that didn&#x2019;t include beer. No suds, no buds.</p>

<title>Who Are You Wearing? Brand Personality</title>
<p>Some brands have their own personality. They are imbued with human qualities with which consumers identify. Brands may be perceived as honest, fun, exciting, cool, sophisticated, sexy, or nerdy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_1">Aaker (1997)</xref> developed the brand personality scale, which rates brands on the basis of characteristics such as perceived sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness. What&#x2019;s more, a brand&#x2019;s personality tends to &#x201C;rub off&#x201D; on consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_71">Park &#x0026; John, 2010</xref>). After shopping at Victoria&#x2019;s Secret, for example, females might see themselves as more attractive, sexy, or glamorous.</p>
<p>Modern branding includes cultivating <italic>brand relationships</italic>. Some consumers may regard a brand as they would a best friend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_34">Fournier, 1998</xref>), while others may view brands as extensions of themselves (Belk, 1998). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_39">Halloran (2014)</xref> observes, &#x201C;we don&#x2019;t just consume or interact with brands. We engage in relationships with them. With some brands, we have wild, short-term flings. Others stay with us for a lifetime&#x201D; (p. 3). Brands also serve as vehicles for self-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_89">Swaminathan, Stilley, &#x0026; Ahluwalia, 2009</xref>). Some consumers go so far as to get brands tattooed on their bodies (Orend &#x0026; Gagn&#x00E9;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_68">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Branding occurs in other ways. <italic>Aspirational brands</italic> are those that consumers admire and aspire to own one day. They represent the ideal. Rolex watches, Viking stoves, and Gucci handbags fall into this category. The Martha Stewart brand is aspirational. Few women will actually make the complicated recipes featured in her magazine, but they like to think that they could. Aspirational brands may be so expensive that consumers settle for knock-off versions instead.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3_7_3">
<title>Authenticity: Keeping It Real</title>
<p>Another approach is brand <italic>authenticity,</italic> which emphasizes genuineness, integrity, and down-to-earth values. The website Etsy is devoted to such goods. Authentic brands may be hand crafted, like craft beers and artisanal cheeses. They may be ecofriendly, like &#x201C;farm-to-table&#x201D; restaurants and boutique bicycles. They often have a story to tell. They emphasize the values of the person or company behind the brand. Ben &#x0026; Jerry&#x2019;s ice cream is a case in point. Authentic brands may try to build a community around the brand. Dove&#x2019;s &#x201C;real beauty&#x201D; campaign exemplifies this theme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3_7_4">
<title>Cause-Related Marketing: The Feel-Good Factor</title>
<p>Many consumers want to make the world a better place. Corporations want to sell things. So why not align consumers&#x2019; purchases with doing good deeds? <italic>Cause-related marketing</italic> (CRM) makes consumers feel good about themselves by feeling good about their purchases. They aren&#x2019;t just shopping. They are contributing to the greater good. The expression &#x201C;think globally, shop locally&#x201D; reflects this trend.</p>
<p>Suppose you are a conscientious consumer seeking an upscale cup of coffee. Why not buy a Fair Trade cup of joe? It comes with a psychological pat on the back for doing a good deed. TOMS Shoes, Product (RED), the Livestrong brand, and the Susan G. Komen Foundation&#x2019;s pink ribbon products employ this strategy.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_65">65</target>Cause-related marketing is part of a larger trend toward <italic>corporate social responsibility</italic> (CSR). Corporations want to be seen as good citizens, giving back to communities, and engaging in philanthropy. Although &#x201C;shopping as philanthropy&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_24">Einstein, 2012</xref>) may seem like a win&#x2013;win&#x2013;win for the consumer, the company, and the charity, there is a downside as well. A concept called <italic>moral licensing</italic> suggests that if a person buys a cause-related product, she or he may be less likely to make an actual donation to that cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_57">Krishna, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_58">2011b</xref>). &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve already done a good deed&#x201D; the person reasons. Yet the amount that actually goes to the charity may be a few cents on the dollar. Sending even one dollar directly to the charity might do far more good.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3_7_5">
<title>Sloganeering</title>
<p>Another means of fostering favorable associations is through <italic>sloganeering.</italic> The importance of slogans in persuasion is underscored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_87">Sharkansky (2002)</xref>, who observes, &#x201C;politics would be poorer without them, advertising could not exist, and religion would be in trouble&#x201D; (p. 75). Consider the following advertising taglines. Notice the positive associations they are designed to instill with respect to each product.</p>
<verse-group>
<verse-line>&#x201C;When you&#x2019;re here, you&#x2019;re family.&#x201D; (Olive Garden)</verse-line>
<verse-line>&#x201C;Breakfast of champions.&#x201D; (Wheaties)</verse-line>
<verse-line>&#x201C;Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.&#x201D; (State Farm)</verse-line>
<verse-line>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll leave the light on for you.&#x201D; (Motel 6)</verse-line>
<verse-line>&#x201C;Because you&#x2019;re worth it&#x201D; (L&#x2019;Or&#x00E9;al)</verse-line>
</verse-group>
<p>The slogans imbue the products with positive qualities that, over time, become embedded in receivers&#x2019; minds. If you feel like &#x201C;eatin&#x2019; good in the neighborhood,&#x201D; where would you go for dinner?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3_7_6">
<title>Sponsorship</title>
<p>Another way of linking products and services with favorable attitudes is through <italic>sponsorship.</italic> Earlier, we mentioned Red Bull&#x2019;s sponsorship of extreme, gravity sports. Most major sporting events now have corporate sponsors who provide funding in return for the right to associate their products with the event. Almost every stadium and ballpark in America now has a corporate sponsor.</p>
<p>Naturally, advertisers aren&#x2019;t the only ones who try to tie themselves to favorable associations. When candidates for political office kiss babies, eat home cooking, and stand next to the flag, they are trying to link themselves to positive, patriotic values. Negative political campaigning, or &#x201C;mudslinging,&#x201D; serves the same purpose in reverse: A candidate seeks to link his or her opponent with negative associations.</p>
<p>A major tenet of persuasion thus involves establishing favorable connections between attitudes and attitude objects. Persuaders try to establish these connections by selling an image or lifestyle. When you buy a product, you are buying into the image as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_34">Fournier, 1998</xref>). But do you really need to have a relationship with your <target target-type="page" id="page_66">66</target>credit card (&#x201C;My card, my city&#x201D; [American Express])? Do you really want brands to define you (&#x201C;Do you speak Prada?&#x201D;)? Sometimes it is important to break the connections that advertisers are trying to create.</p>

<sec id="sec3_8">
<title>Psychological Consistency</title>
<p>People strive to be consistent. This simple principle forms the basis for a whole host of theories, variously known as &#x201C;cognitive consistency&#x201D; theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_28">Festinger, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_44">Heider, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_69">Osgood &#x0026; Tannenbaum, 1955</xref>). Consistency was originally conceived of as a &#x201C;drive-reduction&#x201D; theory. More current thinking suggests that consistency is also socially motivated and is as much an attempt to manage face and project a favorable self-image as it is an internal drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_36">Greenwald &#x0026; Ronis, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_61">Matz &#x0026; Wood, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_85">Scher &#x0026; Cooper, 1989</xref>). Although the individual theories differ somewhat in their approaches, we&#x2019;ve integrated the tenets of several theories here in order to present a more coherent perspective. Though this principle is fairly basic, the recognition that most people strive to remain consistent in their thoughts, words, and deeds reveals a good deal about processes of social influence.</p>
<sec id="sec3_8_1">
<title>The Inner Peace of Consistency</title>
<p>When harmony exists among our attitudes, beliefs, values, and behavior, life is ducky. When there are inconsistencies in what we think, say, or do, however, we tend to experience psychological discomfort. A classic example is that, for smokers, the knowledge that they smoke and that smoking causes cancer is psychologically uncomfortable. Another example involves children whose parents are undergoing a divorce or separation. The children often experience psychological conflict because they can&#x2019;t understand why two people, whom they love, don&#x2019;t want to remain married.</p>
<p>The amount of psychological discomfort that results from holding incompatible attitudes is not the same in all situations. The degree of discomfort depends on the <italic>centrality</italic> of the attitudes involved. If the issue is relatively minor (for example, a person prefers plastic grocery bags but knows paper bags are better for the environment), the amount of psychological discomfort will be small. If the issue is major, as when attitudes involve core beliefs or values, then the psychological consequences can be enormous (for example, the mother of a teenage girl is fervently pro-life but learns that her daughter has just had an abortion).</p>
<p>To understand the nature and effects of psychological consistency, attitude theorists have developed a means of graphically depicting compatible and incompatible attitude states. For example, suppose that Muffin thinks of herself as a firm believer in animal rights. However, while out shopping, she finds a leather jacket that looks &#x201C;totally cool.&#x201D; Her attitudes toward animal rights and owning the jacket are in conflict. Her psychological dilemma is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3_7">Figure 3.7</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig3_7" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.7</label>
<caption><title>Muffin&#x2019;s dilemma: an illustration of consistency theory.</title></caption>
<graphic orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fig3_7.jpg"/>
</fig>
<p>According to consistency theory, Muffin will experience psychological stress no matter what decision she makes. If she buys the jacket, she&#x2019;ll sacrifice her principles; if she doesn&#x2019;t buy the jacket, she&#x2019;ll forgo an opportunity to look cool. Muffin&#x2019;s case is not unique. We are all confronted with dilemmas involving our attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors on a daily basis. Because psychological inconsistency is unpleasant we are motivated to avoid it, deny it, reduce it, or eliminate it when it occurs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3_8_2">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_67">67</target>Methods of Maintaining Consistency</title>
<p>How do people go about reconciling incompatible attitudes when they occur? People don&#x2019;t necessarily preserve or restore psychological consistency in logical ways. They do so in psychological ways&#x2014;that is, ways they find psychologically satisfying or comfortable but that may or may not be strictly logical. Using the example of Muffin, scholars suggest a number of possible routes for resolving inconsistency:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Denial:</italic> Denying or ignoring any inconsistency. &#x201C;I really don&#x2019;t like that jacket after all&#x201D; or &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t really need a jacket now.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Bolstering:</italic> Rationalizing or making excuses. &#x201C;That cow is already dead, so what difference can it make?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Sooner or later someone will come along and buy that jacket anyway.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Bargaining:</italic> Striving to reach a compromise between the conflicting attitudes. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll buy the jacket and volunteer to work at an animal shelter.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Differentiation:</italic> Separating or distinguishing the attitudes in conflict. &#x201C;The jacket is cowhide. Cows aren&#x2019;t an endangered species. It&#x2019;s not as if I&#x2019;m buying a jacket made from a baby harp seal or a spotted owl.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Transcendence:</italic> Focusing on a larger or higher level. &#x201C;No one is perfect. We all give in to temptation every once in a while.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Modifying one or both attitudes:</italic> Altering the attitudes themselves to become more consistent. &#x201C;I need to be more practical and keep my concern for animals&#x2019; rights in perspective.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Communicating:</italic> Trying to convince others to change or convince others one did the right thing. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll just have to convince my friends that I&#x2019;m not a hypocrite when they see me in my new jacket.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_68">68</target>Of course, these are only some of the ways people go about maintaining consistency. In trying to gauge which approach a person will use, a good rule of thumb is that people follow an <italic>efficiency principle</italic>; they tend to reduce dissonance in the most efficient way possible&#x2014;that is, they tend to follow the path of least resistance in finding a way to restore consistency. Changing an inconsequential attitude to restore consistency, for example, is much more likely than changing a core attitude.</p>

<title>Marketing Strategies: How to Have Your Cake and Eat It Too</title>
<p>Now that you understand the basic nature of consistency theories, let&#x2019;s look at how neatly consistency theories apply to persuasion. Imagine that you are at the supermarket. You have a craving for ice cream, but you&#x2019;re on a diet. No problem. You can buy a &#x201C;light&#x201D; brand with reduced fat and fewer calories. In fact, thanks to modern technology, you can choose from a veritable array of frozen desserts including ice milk, frozen yogurt, diabetic ice cream, fruit sorbet, or a nonfat, nondairy product. Think how many other products at the grocery store rely on the principle of &#x201C;having your cake and eating it too.&#x201D; There are &#x201C;light,&#x201D; &#x201C;fat free,&#x201D; &#x201C;cholesterol free,&#x201D; &#x201C;high fiber,&#x201D; &#x201C;low sodium,&#x201D; &#x201C;calcium enriched,&#x201D; and &#x201C;natural&#x201D; food products on every shelf. The marketing strategy behind such products is to allow consumers to make food purchases that are consistent with their beliefs regarding health and nutrition.</p>

<sec id="sec3_8_4">
<title>Brand Loyalty: Accept No Substitute</title>
<p>The concept of <italic>brand loyalty</italic> offers another useful illustration of psychological consistency. Advertisers want us to experience psychological discomfort if we change brands. By instilling brand loyalty in us, advertisers hope to discourage product switching. We are trained by Madison Avenue to remain faithful to one motor oil, be true to one long-distance provider, stay devoted to one pain reliever, or cherish a particular make of car. Consider the following slogans:

<title>Write and Tell Us Why You Love This Book in 24 Words or Less</title>
<p>Yet another means of reinforcing brand loyalty is through active participation on the part of the consumer. Viewers can text in their votes on a variety of reality shows. Sometimes a prize is offered for calling a radio station or writing an essay about a <target target-type="page" id="page_69">69</target>product. Win or lose, the mere act of calling, writing, or texting is bound to increase one&#x2019;s allegiance. Active participation increases commitment.</p>
<p>Brand loyalty can also be encouraged through merchandising. People who wear branded clothing (a Cubs jersey, a Pink hoodie, a Fender T-shirt) are paying for the right to serve as walking billboards&#x2014;and engaging in self-persuasion to boot.</p>
<p>An example of how consumers succumb to merchandising pressure involves one of this book&#x2019;s ever-gullible authors. He liked the Indian maiden logo on Land O&#x2019;Lakes butter. So when he learned he could order two Land O&#x2019;Lakes mugs for only &#x0024;7.95, plus three proof-of-purchase seals from any Land O&#x2019;Lakes product, he couldn&#x2019;t resist. He switched from margarine to butter. He bought only Land O&#x2019;Lakes butter for the next three months (the amount of time it took to accumulate three proof-of-purchase seals). When he found he&#x2019;d lost one of the proof-of-purchase seals he was despondent. Did he give up? Nay, nay! He went out and bought another package of Land O&#x2019;Lakes butter <italic>he didn&#x2019;t even need,</italic> just to complete the trio of proof-of-purchase seals. The author is now the proud owner of a pair of Land O&#x2019;Lakes mugs, complete with Indian maiden logo, but let&#x2019;s examine what can be learned from this lesson:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The merchandising offer got the author actively involved in the process of reinforcing his own brand loyalty. Because the mugs themselves cost little to manufacture, the author was paying Land O&#x2019;Lakes for the privilege of becoming a loyal consumer.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The merchandising offer secured the author&#x2019;s brand loyalty for a period of 3&#x2013;4 months. In fact, the author still buys the Land O&#x2019;Lakes brand whenever he purchases butter (after all, he has the mugs to remind him where his loyalty lies).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><target target-type="page" id="page_70">70</target>The author bought and used far more butter than he otherwise would have without the mug offer. In fact, as he was closing in on that elusive third proof-of-purchase seal, he was searching high and low for ways to use butter.</p></list-item>

<title>Marketing Inconsistency</title>
<p>Of course, other advertising campaigns, typically those for newer products or products with a smaller market share, use just the opposite strategy. These ads encourage us to switch brands. They realize that consumers can be set in their ways. These advertisers try to create psychological imbalance. They want us to have second thoughts about the products and services on which we&#x2019;ve been relying unquestioningly year after year. Consider the following advertising slogans:
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;Think different.&#x201D; (Macintosh computers)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Think outside the bun.&#x201D; (Taco Bell)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Switch and play.&#x201D; (Nintendo)</p>
<p>&#x201C;I could have had a V8!&#x201D; (V8 vegetable juice)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Such slogans are based on the recognition that consumers can be set in their ways and seek to overcome this inertia by encouraging brand switching. Many other types of advertising campaigns are based on creating a state of psychological inconsistency.</p>

<p>The use of consistency theory isn&#x2019;t only for advertisers, marketers, and other &#x201C;professional&#x201D; persuaders. You, too, can incorporate the principles of consistency theory in your own persuasive messages. One way you can accomplish this is to align your message with your audience&#x2019;s frame of reference. It is much easier to tailor a suit to fit a person than it is to change a person&#x2019;s figure to fit a suit. Similarly, successful persuasion isn&#x2019;t so much a matter of shifting receivers&#x2019; attitudes over to your position as it is a matter of adapting your message to the attitudes of your audience. A child who suggests to her mother, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s play hooky and go to the zoo today. Zoos are very educational!&#x201D; is adapting her message to the mother&#x2019;s value system. Such adaptation is key to persuasion, which is why we discuss this strategy in more detail in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter5">Chapter 5</xref>.</p>
<p>Another way you can apply principles of consistency theory is to highlight potential inconsistencies in receivers&#x2019; attitudes. If you can demonstrate that some of the attitudes held by your receivers are incompatible, you may motivate them to change their attitudes in the direction you are advocating. Be cautious, however, when employing this strategy. If you attempt to drive too big a psychological wedge between your receivers&#x2019; attitudes, they may simply change their attitudes and come to dislike you.</p>

<title>Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT)</title>
<p>Suppose you are a fan of Apple products. You are also aware that Chinese workers who assemble them work in deplorable conditions. Would you throw away your iPod, iPhone, or iPad? If you think of yourself as an honest person, would it bother you to download music illegally, or would you find a way to justify your piracy and disregard for copyright laws? People often hold contradictory positions on issues. Their talk doesn&#x2019;t match their walk. For example, many voters say they are opposed to &#x201C;Big Government&#x201D; and federal handouts, even though they are receiving government assistance. According to a nationwide survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_63">Mettler, 2011</xref>), 44 percent of Social Security recipients and 40 percent of Medicare recipients reported they did not receive any government assistance!</p>
<p>How can people hold such seemingly contradictory views? Why do they engage in what appears to be hypocritical behavior? Leon Festinger&#x2019;s <italic>cognitive dissonance theory</italic> (CDT) does a nice job of explaining how people rationalize contradictory decisions and behaviors in their own minds and to other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_18">Cooper, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_28">Festinger, 1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_29">1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_30">Festinger &#x0026; Carlsmith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_41">Harmon-Jones &#x0026; Harmon-Jones, 2008</xref>). The basic idea is that after making a decision or performing a behavior, a person worries about whether she or he made the right decision or did the right thing. The person is therefore motivated to reduce the resulting dissonance. For this reason, CDT is often referred to as a &#x201C;post-decision theory.&#x201D; The anticipation of having to make a tough choice, however, also can produce dissonance. People sometimes say it &#x201C;hurts&#x201D; or it&#x2019;s &#x201C;painful&#x201D; to make a difficult decision. In fact, researchers found that taking acetaminophen reduced the pain of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_19">DeWall, Chester, &#x0026; White, 2015</xref>). The researchers concluded that &#x201C;the pain of decision making is not a mere metaphor&#x201D; (p. 119). Cognitive dissonance, it turns out, involves some of the same neural pathways associated with physical pain.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_72">72</target>Aside from popping Tylenol, how else can people reduce cognitive dissonance? An intriguing aspect of CDT is the variety of ways in which people try to reconcile their angst. For example, they may employ a &#x201C;sour grapes&#x201D; strategy. Like the fox in Aesop&#x2019;s fable who tried repeatedly but failed to reach some grapes, they conclude, &#x201C;They were probably sour anyway.&#x201D;</p>

<title>Cognitive Dissonance and Buyer&#x2019;s Remorse</title>
<p>The theory of cognitive dissonance is closely connected to the phenomenon known as <italic>buyer&#x2019;s remorse.</italic> Imagine that a consumer shelled out a lot of money for a big, flat-screen TV, only to find out a few weeks later that a newer, better model was available for less money. To assuage their lingering doubts, buyers engage in dissonance-reduction strategies. One method, known as <italic>selective exposure,</italic> involves seeking out consonant information and avoiding dissonant information. The TV buyer might reread ads and articles recommending the brand he or she purchased and avoid ads and articles for other brands. Cognitive dissonance isn&#x2019;t an all-or-nothing phenomenon. It occurs in varying degrees. The amount of dissonance one experiences is known as the <italic>magnitude of dissonance.</italic> Spending &#x0024;8,000 on a plasma TV that wasn&#x2019;t very reliable would produce more dissonance than spending &#x0024;8 on a movie that wasn&#x2019;t very good.</p>

<sec id="sec3_9_2">
<title>Polarization of Alternatives</title>
<p>When making a tough decision, a person tends to <italic>polarize</italic> the attractiveness of the alternatives once the decision is made. Suppose Lola has to decide between an iPhone and an Android. It is a close call. Each model has its pros and cons. Once Lola makes her choice, she will tend to disparage the unchosen brand and value the chosen brand even more. What was formerly a tough choice becomes a &#x201C;no brainer.&#x201D; The tendency to spread the alternatives is a form of self-justification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_90">Tavris &#x0026; Aronson, 2007</xref>). It is easier to see choices in terms of &#x201C;black and white&#x201D; than shades of gray. This explains why voters who are initially torn between two candidates solidify their preference once they cast their ballot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_8">Besley &#x0026; Joslyn, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec3_9_3">
<title>Cognitive Dissonance, Self-Image, and Culture</title>
<p>Cognitive dissonance can be largely internal in nature, such as when a person is confronted with a moral dilemma. Dissonance also can arise when one&#x2019;s self-image is inconsistent with one&#x2019;s beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. For instance, a person who thinks of himself or herself as unprejudiced but who laughs at a racist, sexist, or homophobic joke might experience cognitive dissonance. There is a cultural component to dissonance as well. For Americans and others from individualistic cultures, dissonance tends to be more internally motivated, while for Asians and others from more collectivistic cultures, dissonance tends to be more socially motivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_49">Hoshino-Browne, Zanna, Spencer, Zanna, Kitayama, &#x0026; Lackenbauer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_55">Kitayama et al., 2004</xref>). While some studies suggest that Asians have a greater tolerance for inconsistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_2">Aaker &#x0026; Sengupta, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_67">Nisbett, 2003</xref>), others suggest just the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_96">Xie, Jang, &#x0026; Cai, 2007</xref>). There is also evidence that dissonance is a culturally universal phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_23">Egan, Santos, &#x0026; Bloom, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_73">73</target>Factors That Affect the Magnitude of Dissonance</title>
<p>Four paradigms that moderate cognitive dissonance have been studied by researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_6">Beauvois &#x0026; Joule, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_42">Harmon-Jones &#x0026; Mills, 1999</xref>). One of these, known as the <italic>free choice paradigm,</italic> states that the greater the choice one has in making a decision, the more dissonance one will suffer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_18">Cooper (2007)</xref> emphasizes that dissonance occurs <italic>only</italic> if the negative outcome of a freely chosen decision was foreseeable at the time the person made the choice. Otherwise the person can say, &#x201C;How was I to know?&#x201D; A second paradigm, known as <italic>belief disconfirmation,</italic> argues that dissonance is aroused when a person encounters information contrary to his or her beliefs. The person engages in denial and resorts to <italic>selective exposure</italic> by ignoring or distorting information that contradicts his or her belief system. A third paradigm is called <italic>induced compliance.</italic> When a person is forced to do something, little dissonance is aroused because the person can rationalize the action by saying &#x201C;I had no choice.&#x201D; The fourth paradigm, called the <italic>effort justification paradigm,</italic> centers on the amount of effort or sacrifice required: the greater the effort, the greater the dissonance.</p>

<title>Dissonance and Persuasion: Putting It All Together</title>
<p>Persuasive messages can be tailored to either increase or decrease dissonance in receivers. A persuader might want to arouse dissonance in a target audience to get people to rethink their position on an issue. Or, conversely, a persuader might seek to allay people&#x2019;s doubts by reassuring them that their decision or action was justified. In this case, the persuader would want to convince receivers that they did the right thing and they had no other realistic alternative. Recent research shows that attitude change brought about by CDT can have lasting effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_86">S&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;meaud &#x0026; Somat, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Forbidden Fruit: Psychological Reactance</title>
<p>In 2003, Barbra Streisand filed a lawsuit against a photographer for taking aerial photos along California&#x2019;s coastline, including her Malibu home, and posting them on the Web. Prior to the lawsuit, few people had bothered to look at the photos. After the publicity surrounding the lawsuit, however, people flocked to the website in droves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_5">Arthur, 2009</xref>). Half a million viewers logged on to see what the fuss was about. A judge subsequently dismissed the suit. Similarly, when the MPAA filed a lawsuit against The Pirate Bay for facilitating illegal downloading of movies, the website became more popular than ever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_88">Sullivan, 2009</xref>). Attempts to muzzle information on the Web often backfire, a phenomenon Mike Masnick termed the <italic>Streisand effect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_60">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>When people believe that their freedom is being threatened, they tend to rebel. Tell a little kid not to play with a particular toy and the kid won&#x2019;t be able to keep his grubby little hands off it. Tell your teenage daughter that you disapprove of her new boyfriend and she&#x2019;ll like him even more. The tendency to react defensively to perceived encroachments on our freedom is called <italic>psychological reactance</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_10">Brehm, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_11">Brehm &#x0026; Brehm, 1981</xref>). You may also know of it as &#x201C;reverse psychology.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Psychological reactance can help or hinder persuasion. Suppose a mother wants to get her picky 3-year-old to eat her broccoli. The mother could use a controlling <target target-type="page" id="page_74">74</target>message such as, &#x201C;You are going to sit there until you finish your broccoli.&#x201D; This approach might backfire, however, if the daughter is willing to sit and pout for an hour. Instead, the mother could use psychological reactance to her advantage by saying, &#x201C;Mabel, there is no way you can eat that broccoli in less than a minute. No way.&#x201D; Now the daughter may want to prove she&#x2019;s up to the challenge.</p>
<p>A wealth of studies on littering behavior reveal that a negative or punitive message (&#x201C;No littering!&#x201D; or &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you dare litter.&#x201D;) actually <italic>increases</italic> littering compared to a polite message (&#x201C;Please pitch in.&#x201D;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_40">Hansmann &#x0026; Sholz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_48">Horsley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_50">Huffman, Grossnickle, Cope, &#x0026; Huffman, 1995</xref>). Stated simply, asking is a more effective strategy than ordering. Psychological reactance also has been examined on a variety of other topics, including alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_20">Dillard &#x0026; Shen, 2005</xref>), condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_80">Quick &#x0026; Stephenson, 2007</xref>), drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_13">Burgoon et al., 2002</xref>), promotional health messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_65">Miller, Lane, Deatrick, Young, &#x0026; Potts, 2007</xref>), and smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_64">Miller, Burgoon, Grandpre, &#x0026; Alvaro, 2006</xref>). The tendency to react negatively to perceived threats varies from person to person. These individual differences can be measured with the <italic>psychological reactance scale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_46">Hong, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_47">Hong &#x0026; Faedda, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>To avoid a boomerang effect, a persuader should be cautious about using controlling language. A politician who says &#x201C;You must vote for this proposition. It is the only way&#x201D; is practically daring voters to reject the measure. To use psychological reactance to his or her advantage, a persuader should acknowledge listeners&#x2019; personal autonomy. A politician who says &#x201C;I favor this measure, but you&#x2019;ll have to make up your own minds&#x201D; is less likely to provoke resistance. A persuader also can use psychological reactance against an opponent. For example, a candidate might argue &#x201C;My opponent wants to limit your health care options, but I want you to be able to choose your own health care provider.&#x201D; We return to the subject of psychological reactance in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter8">Chapter 8</xref> when we discuss the <italic>scarcity principle</italic>, and in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter11">Chapter 11</xref> when we discuss the <italic>evoking freedom technique</italic>.</p>

<title>Counterattitudinal Advocacy: Playing Devil&#x2019;s Advocate</title>
<p>An even better approach to changing people&#x2019;s attitudes is to get them to persuade themselves. This can be accomplished by having them engage in what is called <italic>counterattitudinal advocacy</italic> (CAA). CAA involves having people create and present (orally or in writing) a message that is at odds with their existing attitudes&#x2014;for example, claiming they favor capital punishment when, in fact, they oppose it. Research demonstrates that after engaging in CAA, people&#x2019;s attitudes will tend to shift in the direction of the position advocated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_28">Festinger, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_53">Kelman, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_78">Preiss &#x0026; Allen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_86">S&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;meaud &#x0026; Somat, 2009</xref>). Mind you, their attitudes won&#x2019;t undergo a complete reversal. Some degree of attitude change takes place, such that the initially counterattitudinal position becomes somewhat more favorable in the people&#x2019;s minds.</p>
<p>The explanation is that CAA causes psychological conflict within people. They are aware of the inconsistency between their privately held beliefs and attitudes, and their public behavior. One means of resolving the conflict is to make their private beliefs and attitudes more consistent with their public behavior&#x2014;hence, the resultant shift in attitudes. This suggests an effective way of getting other people to persuade <target target-type="page" id="page_75">75</target>themselves. Simply try to get them to speak or act in a manner that is contrary to their attitudes. This can be accomplished by asking them to role-play for a few minutes, or to play devil&#x2019;s advocate for a while. The research demonstrates that attitude change should follow in the direction of the counterattitudinal position. When using this technique, however, it is important that the other people <italic>choose</italic> to engage in CAA, as opposed to being forced to do so. A meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_78">Preiss and Allen (1998)</xref> revealed that voluntarily engaging in CAA is the key to this strategy&#x2019;s effectiveness.</p>

<title>I&#x2019;m All in: Increasing Commitment</title>
<p>Commitment goes hand in hand with persuasion. When people become committed to ideas, groups, causes, or decisions they find it difficult to change their minds. By way of example, did you know that once horse-racing fans have bet on a horse, they become even more convinced their horse will win (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_56">Knox &#x0026; Inkster, 1968</xref>)? Individuals who volunteer their time to work for political campaigns tend to overestimate the prospects of their candidate winning. The more public the nature of the commitment, the more psychologically entrenched people become.</p>
<p>Many social customs and rituals are designed to increase a person&#x2019;s sense of psychological commitment to an idea, group, cause, or decision. Wedding engagements do so. Fraternity initiation rituals do so as well. Boot camp in the military serves this purpose. Baptism achieves this goal. This also explains why people often announce their New Year&#x2019;s resolutions publicly. Doing so binds them all the more to their commitments. Political rallies, protest marches, and demonstrations accomplish this function for the participants. Whenever we make public statements or engage in public actions, we tend to become bound by our words or deeds. Yes, we can renege on what we&#x2019;ve said or done, but we will pay a psychological price for doing so. The greater the public commitment, the greater the toll paid.</p>

<title>Commitments Can &#x201C;Grow Legs&#x201D;</title>
<p>In the movie <italic>Tin Cup</italic> (1996), Roy McAvoy is a gifted golfer who makes his own bad luck. In a heroic comeback bid, he finds himself in contention to win the U.S. Open. He refuses to play it safe, however. On an over-water approach shot to the 18th hole, he goes for the flag. The ball lands in the water. Rather than cut his losses, he takes the same shot again and again, each time with the same result. On his 12th try, and down to his last ball, he finally clears the water and the ball rolls in the cup. He loses the tournament, but proves something to himself. Let&#x2019;s face it, we all behave a bit like Roy from time to time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3_16">Robert Cialdini (1993)</xref> makes the interesting point that commitments sometimes &#x201C;grow legs.&#x201D; By this he means that once we become committed to a given course of action, we tend to remain steadfast in our determination, even if the reason for selecting that course of action is diminished, altered, or eliminated.</p>

He signed a contract with the lowest bidder for a &#x0024;3,000 retaining wall made of river rock. A few days before the work was to begin, the author had another idea. As long as he was going to all the trouble and expense, why not build in a recessed bench for reading? And, his wife added, why not add some steps, so it would be easy to get up and down? The &#x0024;3,000 wall soon became a &#x0024;4,000 wall.</p>
<p>But it didn&#x2019;t end there. Once the wall was completed, the author sprang for sprinklers and landscaping. After all, the wall looked so good, it was worth a little extra to make it a focal point of the backyard. In the end, the &#x0024;1,000 wall became a &#x0024;4,500 wall.

<p>Keep in mind, a large initial commitment isn&#x2019;t required in order for persuaders to take advantage of us. Even relatively simple acts, such as raising your hand, signing a petition, or filling out a form, can be enough. The fact that commitments can grow legs means that we are vulnerable to self-persuasion as well. Remember, we manufacture the additional reasons for bolstering our commitment ourselves. Once we become committed, we may become blind to alternative ways of seeing, thinking, or acting. Thus, we need to remain on guard, not only from others seeking to extract commitments from us but also from ourselves.</p>
<p>Before concluding this section, we wish to note that several worthwhile lessons can be learned from our discussion of commitment and consistency. First, don&#x2019;t allow persuaders to &#x201C;box you in&#x201D; by getting you to commit to something when you really don&#x2019;t want to. Feel free to say, &#x201C;I want to think it over&#x201D; or &#x201C;I want to consider some other options first&#x201D; or &#x201C;You&#x2019;re not trying to rush me into a hasty decision, are you?&#x201D; Second, don&#x2019;t paint yourself into a corner by making public commitments you really don&#x2019;t want, or intend, to keep. Be willing to say, &#x201C;Sorry, I&#x2019;d rather not&#x201D; or &#x201C;I have to say &#x2018;No&#x2019; this time.&#x201D; Third, if you do happen to make an ill-advised commitment, admit it and see what you can do to correct it. Don&#x2019;t double-down on a bad decision. Avoid becoming so preoccupied with saving face that you follow through on a really bad idea. When buying anything, ask about a return or refund policy in advance.</p>

<p>The concept of <italic>attitude</italic> is central to the study of persuasion. Attitudes can&#x2019;t be directly observed. They can, however, be inferred and measured through a variety of explicit and implicit means, most commonly via standardized scales. The theory of reasoned action provides a useful, rational model of how attitudes and intentions guide behavior. People&#x2019;s attitudes tend to correlate with their behavior, more so when the attitudes are formed via central processing than peripheral processing. Attitudes formed via central processing are also more persistent and resistant to change. We discussed the fact that attitudes exist in associative networks, and that advertisers use these connections to foster favorable images and associations with their products and services. People have a tendency to strive for consistency among their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Persuaders can adapt their messages either to reinforce consistency or to create inconsistency. Cognitive dissonance, a specialized form of consistency theory, explains how people go about rationalizing decisions after they have made them. The phenomenon of psychological reactance can be used to a persuader&#x2019;s advantage. Engaging in counterattitudinal advocacy or making commitments, especially public commitments, are two important means of facilitating influence, based on the theory of cognitive dissonance.</p>

<title>Notes</title>
<fn id="fn3_1"><label>1</label><p>The implicit&#x2013;explicit distinction is not a hard-and-fast distinction. Some explicit attitudes may be activated in a nearly automatic, spontaneous manner. Some implicit attitudes may not be beyond a person&#x2019;s conscious awareness.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3_2"><label>2</label><p>This explanation is highly consistent with findings based on <italic>inoculation theory</italic>, which we discuss in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter9">Chapter 9</xref>. Inoculating receivers against opposing arguments (e.g., giving them a small dose of the arguments they are likely to hear, along with answers to those arguments) requires that they actively think about message content. This increased mental effort makes them more resistant to opposing arguments presented at a later date.</p></fn>

<p>BARACK OBAMA AND DONALD TRUMP have it. So do astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and media mogul Oprah Winfrey. John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Princess Diana had it. So did Adolf Hitler, unfortunately. Depending on whom you ask, Dwayne Johnson, Narendra Modi, Ellen DeGeneres, and Sir Richard Branson have it. What all these people have, or had, is <italic>charisma. Charisma</italic> is a lay term used to describe someone who possesses a certain indefinable charm or allure. Such a person may be said to have a magnetic personality or possess a sense of <italic>savoir faire</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_56">Riggio, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_57">2010</xref>).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_84">84</target>There is a problem with describing people as charismatic, however. The term has no clear, precise meaning. Because charisma is a fuzzy concept, persuasion researchers tend to rely instead on a different but related concept called <italic>ethos,</italic> or <italic>source credibility.</italic> Ethos bears some similarity to charisma. However, whereas charisma represents an elusive, ineffable quality, ethos can be defined and measured with much greater precision. In this chapter, we examine the concept of ethos, or source credibility, and its relationship to persuasion. First we examine credibility as it relates to celebrity endorsers and spokespersons. Next we offer a definition, discuss the basic features, and explore the underlying dimensions that make up credibility. Then we consider how credibility functions according to Petty and Cacioppo&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_51">1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_52">1986b</xref>) <italic>elaboration likelihood model</italic> of persuasion, and we examine a phenomenon known as the <italic>sleeper effect.</italic> Finally, we discuss credibility as it applies to both institutions and interpersonal settings.</p>

<title>Celebrity Selling Power: The Answer is in the Stars</title>
<p>Did you know that roughly one in four advertisements features a famous person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_22">Elberse &#x0026; Verleun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_63">Spry, Pappu, &#x0026; Cornwall, 2011</xref>)? Were you aware that approximately 10 percent of all advertising expenditures go to pay celebrity endorsers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_1">Agrawal &#x0026; Kamakura, 1995</xref>)? Nike alone spends about &#x0024;500 million per year on celebrity endorsements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_14">Bruno, 2011</xref>). Celebrities and athletes with a high <italic>Q-Score</italic> (their selling quotient)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> can command salaries in millions of dollars. No wonder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_10">Berger (2011)</xref> claims we now live in a <italic>celebritocracy.</italic></p>
<p>Considering all the money that is spent on celebrity endorsements, you might be wondering whether they actually work. When asked, most consumers claim they would never buy a product based on a celebrity endorser&#x2019;s say-so (Study finds &#x2026;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_65">2000</xref>). However, consumers may be more susceptible than they think. Indeed, a phenomenon known as the <italic>third-person effect</italic> reveals that people underestimate the effect advertising has on themselves and overestimate its effect on others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_29">Jensen &#x0026; Collins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_62">Shin &#x0026; Kim, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_32">Knoll &#x0026; Mathis, 2017</xref>) found that celebrity endorsements improved consumers&#x2019; attitudes toward endorsed products, but not necessarily their intentions to purchase those products. Another study found that endorser credibility has a significant effect on <italic>brand equity</italic>, which refers to the value attached to a particular brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_63">Spry, Pappu, &#x0026; Cornwall, 2011</xref>). According to one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_22">Elberse &#x0026; Verleun, 2012</xref>), endorsers boost sales by about 20 percent on average. Celebrity endorsers appear to be most effective at promoting new products and services rather than established brands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_21">Djafarova &#x0026; Rushworth, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_37">Kumkale, Albarrac&#x00ED;n, &#x0026; Seignourel, 2010</xref>). If celebrities didn&#x2019;t yield profits, advertisers wouldn&#x2019;t use them.</p>
<p>That said, some people argue that celebrity endorsers are losing their clout. Why? Consumers are relying more and more on social networks than spokespersons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_75">Weir, 2011</xref>). In fact, some people rate bloggers as more credible than traditional news media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_50">O&#x2019;Neil &#x0026; Eisenmann, 2017</xref>). Even so, celebrities with large numbers of followers, such as Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift, and Justin Bieber, have considerable online clout.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_85">85</target>The Match-Up Hypothesis: Why Jonah Hill Should Not Be Revlon&#x2019;s Spokesperson</title>
<p>The <italic>match-up hypothesis</italic> suggests that an endorser must be a good &#x201C;fit&#x201D; for the brand being endorsed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_30">Kamins &#x0026; Gupta, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_33">Koernig &#x0026; Boyd, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_67">Till &#x0026; Busler, 2000</xref>). As such, Usain Bolt, the &#x201C;world&#x2019;s fastest man,&#x201D; is a natural choice for Gatorade. Likewise, Justin Bieber&#x2019;s huge fan base of young &#x201C;Beliebers&#x201D; makes him a good choice for Proactiv skin-care products.</p>
<p>One explanation of why celebrities should fit the brands they endorse stems from the <italic>meaning transfer perspective</italic>. According to this view, an endorser&#x2019;s public persona is projected onto a brand. The brand&#x2019;s image is then incorporated into the consumer&#x2019;s self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_39">McCracken, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_40">1989</xref>). By way of illustration, Ellen DeGeneres danced her way through one of American Express&#x2019;s &#x201C;My Life, My Card&#x201D; commercials. Independent-minded consumers who see themselves as &#x201C;dancing to their own tune&#x201D; can identify with DeGeneres, whom they see as successful while doing her own thing.</p>

<title>Catch a Falling Star</title>
<p>Of course, there can be a downside to relying on well-known celebrities, athletes, or other famous figures. What happens if a famous person becomes embroiled in a scandal or a legal proceeding? When former Subway pitchman, Jared Fogle, was charged with distributing kiddie porn, the company tossed him like wilted lettuce. After it was revealed that celebrity chef Paula Dean made racist remarks off air, Home Depot and other sponsors dumped her like a pan of hot grease. Following news <target target-type="page" id="page_86">86</target>reports that Olympian Ryan Lochte falsely claimed that he was robbed at gunpoint during the 2016 Olympics, the swimmer&#x2019;s stock with Speedo and Polo Ralph Lauren sunk like a stone.</p>

</fig>
<p>As these examples clearly show, if a celebrity, athlete, journalist, or politician is tainted by scandal, it can rub off on the sponsor&#x2019;s credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_68">Till &#x0026; Shimp, 1998</xref>). To avoid the risk and expense of actual endorsers, many companies rely on fictional spokespersons. Aunt Jemima would never engage in insider trading. The Geico gecko will never be arrested for sexual assault. Mr. Clean won&#x2019;t ever test positive for steroid use, and the Keebler elves won&#x2019;t be charged with child pornography in an undercover sting operation. Having examined the downside of relying too heavily on credibility as a tool of persuasion, let&#x2019;s consider more carefully what it actually is and how it actually works.</p>

<title>What is Credibility?</title>
<p>O&#x2019;Keefe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_49">2002</xref>) defines credibility as &#x201C;judgments made by a perceiver (e.g., a message recipient) concerning the believability of a communicator&#x201D; (p. 181). We suggest that this definition should be extended to institutions as well. Private companies and governmental agencies also have images to protect. They want to be viewed favorably, too. In addition, it should be recognized that in face-to-face encounters there are really <italic>two</italic> sources whose credibility is at stake, because each party to the interaction is simultaneously a sender and a receiver of messages.</p>

<p>An important feature of O&#x2019;Keefe&#x2019;s definition is the recognition that credibility is a <italic>receiver-based construct.</italic> Credibility exists in the eye of the beholder. For example, Edward Snowden may be perceived as a heroic whistleblower by some, and as a publicity-seeking traitor by others. A celebrity who takes a strong political stand may be cheered by some and jeered by others. In short, if these folks are credible, it is because we bestow credibility on them. Modifying a time-worn philosophical question, one might ask, &#x201C;If a source stood in the middle of a forest and there were no one around to perceive him or her, would there be any credibility?&#x201D; Our answer is no. Different sources possess different abilities and attributes, but the value assigned to these abilities and attributes resides in the receiver, not in the source. Credibility is a perceptual phenomenon.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4_2_2">
<title>Credibility Is a Multidimensional Construct</title>
<p>A second important feature of credibility is that it is not a unidimensional construct &#x2014;that is, it is not made up of only one element. Credibility represents a composite of several characteristics that others perceive in a source. Credibility is a <italic>multidimensional construct.</italic> An analogy may serve to clarify. Imagine that you were trying to define <italic>athleticism.</italic> It would be difficult to single out only one thing that makes an individual athletic. Athleticism requires strength, coordination, stamina, and quick reflexes, among other things. Similarly, credibility isn&#x2019;t a single characteristic, but a combination of qualities a source is believed to possess. We discuss these qualities shortly.</p>

<sec id="sec4_2_3">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_87">87</target>Credibility Is a Situational/Contextual Phenomenon</title>
<p>A third feature of credibility is that it is a <italic>situational</italic> or <italic>contextual phenomenon.</italic> A persuader&#x2019;s credibility is subject to change from one audience or setting to another. The very qualities that are admired in a communicator in one setting may be derided in another setting. The president of the National Rifle Association might be well received when speaking before an audience of hunting and fishing enthusiasts. The same source might encounter a hostile reception, however, if he spoke before a group of animal rights advocates. Your own credibility is subject to such situational changes too. You may enjoy more credibility in one context&#x2014;for example, work, family, friends, school&#x2014;than in another.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4_2_4">
<title>Credibility Is Dynamic</title>
<p>Credibility can change over time. For example, in his first 100 days in office, the public&#x2019;s disapproval of President Donald Trump increased 11 percent, from 41 to 55 percent (<uri>https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/</uri>). It is important to recognize, then, that credibility is <italic>dynamic:</italic> It fluctuates over time. A source&#x2019;s credibility can change even during the course of a single speech, sales pitch, or boardroom presentation.</p>

<sec id="sec4_3">
<title>The Factor Analytic Approach to Credibility</title>
<p>Just as chefs are interested in what ingredients go into award-winning recipes, persuasion researchers have tried to determine the &#x201C;ingredients,&#x201D; or underlying dimensions, of credibility. In fact, as long ago as 380 BCE, Aristotle proclaimed in <italic>The Rhetoric</italic> that the ingredients &#x201C;which inspire confidence in the orator&#x2019;s character &#x2026; that induce us to believe a thing apart from any proof of it &#x2026; [are] good sense, good moral character, and good will&#x201D; (1378). Aristotle wasn&#x2019;t far off the mark.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s researchers began to use a statistical technique known as <italic>factor analysis</italic> to uncover the underlying dimensions or ingredients of credibility. Controversy emerged during this period over how many credibility dimensions there were and what they should be called (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_18">Cronkhite &#x0026; Liska, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_53">Pornpitakpan, 2004</xref>). Subsequent investigations, though, have clarified the situation considerably, if not completely.</p>
<sec id="sec4_3_1">
<title>Primary Dimensions of Credibility</title>
<p>There is now fairly solid evidence that there are three <italic>primary dimensions</italic> of credibility that almost always apply to the evaluation of sources. There are also multiple secondary dimensions that are more situation specific. To enhance your own credibility, you should focus on these primary dimensions. The secondary dimensions may or may not matter depending on your particular situation. The scale items used to measure these dimensions can be found in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box4_1">Box 4.1</xref>.</p>
<sec id="sec4_3_1_1">
<title>Expertise</title>
<p>The first primary dimension of credibility is <italic>expertise</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_41">McCroskey, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_53">Pornpitakpan, 2004</xref>). To be credible, a persuader must know his or her stuff or, at least, <italic>appear</italic> to know his or her stuff. Sometimes a title alone, such as MD, PhD, or CPA, can confer credibility on a source. You have to be careful, though; not all <target target-type="page" id="page_88">88</target>titles mean what they say. For example, a person who uses the prefix Dr., may not be a medical doctor or an academic. Honorary doctoral degrees are sometimes awarded by universities, but only as a form of recognition. Kermit the Frog, for instance, received an honorary doctorate of &#x201C;amphibious letters&#x201D; from South Hampton College. What&#x2019;s more, it isn&#x2019;t difficult to buy a doctoral degree online from a non-accredited institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_6">Bartlett &#x0026; Smallwood, 2014</xref>). And, of course, some &#x201C;doctors,&#x201D; like Dr. Dre, Doc Rivers, and Doc Marten are simply nicknames.</p>

<p>To be regarded as experts, sources needn&#x2019;t possess advanced degrees, specialized training, licenses, or credentials, however. For example, at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, members who had been alcoholics for 20 years, and who had been sober for the past 10 years, would likely be perceived as having expertise. Such members would know what they were talking about, because they had &#x201C;been there&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_20">Denzen, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_59">Robertson, 1988</xref>). Even astrologers, fortune-tellers, and psychics make attempts to establish their expertise. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t pay for advice from phony psychics,&#x201D; a psychic website proclaims, &#x201C;We have <italic>genuine, certified psychics</italic> waiting to chat with you online.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Interestingly, a source&#x2019;s expertise doesn&#x2019;t always have to be in the field in which he or she is attempting to persuade. LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo, for example, aren&#x2019;t experts in electronics. Yet they are effective endorsers for Samsung. Endorsements by famous persons enjoy a <italic>halo effect</italic> that allows them to carry their credibility to new, unrelated fields. The halo effect isn&#x2019;t limited to famous people. In one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_58">Rind, 1992</xref>), a confederate working with the experimenter approached shoppers in the food court of a mall and asked them to buy raffle tickets. In one of the experimental conditions, he amazed the shoppers with his calculating ability (the confederate used a hidden transmitter, through which he received the correct answers). In another condition, he made a fool of himself by exhibiting poor calculating skills. In a third control condition, the confederate didn&#x2019;t profess to have any amazing skills. Shoppers bought significantly more raffle tickets when the confederate demonstrated astonishing calculating skills than in either of the other two conditions. It mattered not that the purpose of the raffle was unrelated to the confederate&#x2019;s amazing talent. Expertise, even unrelated expertise, then, can be an asset in persuasion. Bear in mind, however, that purchasing a raffle ticket is a fairly trivial act. We suspect that on a more involving issue, relevant expertise would be valued more highly by receivers.</p>
<p>Although we tend to think of expert sources as being highly confident, this is not always the case. Sources who already possess high credibility may be more influential when they express their opinions with less certainty, whereas sources who have lower credibility are more persuasive when they express their opinions with greater certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_31">Karmarkar &#x0026; Tormala, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4_3_1_2">
<title>Trustworthiness</title>
<p>The second primary dimension of credibility is <italic>trustworthiness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_41">McCroskey, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_53">Pornpitakpan, 2004</xref>). A source may appear knowledgeable, but what if you don&#x2019;t think he or she is being truthful or can be trusted? If your car needs a brake job, you not only want a qualified mechanic, you want an <italic>honest,</italic> qualified mechanic. To be successful, persuaders must, therefore, convey an impression of honesty and integrity.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_90">90</target>Perhaps you&#x2019;ve noticed that some advertisements in magazines or newspapers carry the logo &#x201C;As Seen On TV.&#x201D; The purpose in displaying this logo is to instill trust. Many consumers unthinkingly presume that only reputable companies can afford television commercials. The same applies to <italic>Yellow Pages</italic> ads that feature the ichthys logo, the Christian sign of the fish. Consumers may assume that an electrician, plumber, or carpenter who is a Christian is less likely to rip them off. Such &#x201C;sign reasoning&#x201D; may have merit. But then again, couldn&#x2019;t an unscrupulous tradesperson simply use the ichthys logo to dupe customers into believing that he or she is trust-worthy? Bernie Madoff, a stockbroker and investment advisor, seemed trustworthy, until he was exposed for operating a Ponzi scheme. He defrauded investors out of &#x0024;65 billion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4_3_1_3">
<title>Goodwill</title>
<p>The third primary dimension of credibility is <italic>goodwill</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_43">McCroskey and Teven (1999)</xref> suggest that goodwill is synonymous with <italic>perceived caring</italic>. That is, a source who seems to care about and take a genuine interest in the receiver is displaying goodwill. Goodwill can be demonstrated by displaying understanding for another person&#x2019;s ideas, feelings, or needs. Goodwill can also be demonstrated by displaying empathy&#x2014;that is, identifying with another person&#x2019;s feelings or situation. Goodwill can be displayed by responsiveness as well, by being open and receptive to another&#x2019;s communication attempts. A source who said, &#x201C;I hear where you are coming from&#x201D; or &#x201C;I can relate to that&#x201D; or &#x201C;I sympathize with how you feel&#x201D; would be displaying this quality.</p>
<p>Of the three primary dimensions just discussed, expertise seems to have the greatest effect on persuasion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_76">Wilson and Sherrell (1993)</xref> revealed in a meta-analysis that the effect of expertise was greater than that of trustworthiness, attraction, or similarity on persuasion. The importance of the dimensions on persuasive outcomes, however, may depend on the particular topic or context for persuasion.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4_3_2">
<title>Secondary Dimensions of Credibility</title>
<p>Researchers have uncovered several other dimensions of credibility that tend to be more situation specific. One of these, termed <italic>dynamism</italic> by some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_13">Berlo, Lemert, &#x0026; Mertz, 1969</xref>) and <italic>extroversion</italic> by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_16">Burgoon, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_44">McCroskey &#x0026; Young, 1981</xref>), has to do with how energetic, animated, or enthusiastic the source appears. Obviously, it wouldn&#x2019;t do for a fitness trainer like Jillian Michaels, or a dancer like Julianne Hough, to appear sluggish or lethargic. Certain situations call for the source to be &#x201C;peppy&#x201D; and full of energy. However, a person who is too bubbly and effervescent, especially at the wrong times, may lose credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_15">Burgoon, 1973</xref>). The trick is for a source to match his or her level of dynamism to the demands of the situation.</p>
<p>Another secondary dimension of credibility is <italic>composure</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_46">Miller &#x0026; Hewgill, 1964</xref>). In some situations, we expect a source to remain calm, cool, and collected. The character of James Bond, secret agent 007, exudes this quality. Captain Chesley &#x201C;Sully&#x201D; Sullenberger, who safely landed US Airways flight 1549 on the Hudson River, retained his composure during the entire ordeal. The flight recordings released by the FAA revealed that Sully was &#x201C;the epitome of composure under life-threatening pressure&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_45">McShane, 2009</xref>, p. 12). On the flip-side of the coin, a source who loses composure, or who seems nervous or ill at ease, may lose credibility. When Tom <target target-type="page" id="page_91">91</target>Cruise jumped up and down on Oprah&#x2019;s couch while proclaiming his love for Katie Holmes, viewers felt he had lost it.</p>
<p>An additional secondary dimension of credibility has been dubbed <italic>sociability.</italic> This dimension refers to a source&#x2019;s friendliness or outgoingness. To us, Paul Rudd, Emma Thompson, Rashida Jones, Tom Hanks, Reese Witherspoon, and Magic Johnson possess this quality, as do others who relate to people easily. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_60">Sanders (2006)</xref> emphasizes that friendliness, empathy, and authenticity go a long way in trying to persuade people. Sociability is particularly important in the &#x201C;people professions,&#x201D; such as sales, law, education, social work, and the like.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4_4">
<title>The Factor Analytic Approach and the Real World</title>
<p>Given the extraordinary amount of attention devoted to the study of credibility, how do these dimensions hold up in the real world? The answer is, remarkably well. More than three decades of research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_35">Kouzes and Posner (2017)</xref> involving thousands of people in leadership positions verify that admired people display competence, exhibit honesty, are inspiring, and forward-looking. Kouzes and Posner highlight the overlap with several of the dimensions described above. &#x201C;For trustworthiness, you can say <italic>honest</italic>. For expertise, you can say <italic>competent</italic>. For dynamism, you can say <italic>inspiring</italic>. In other words &#x2026; what has been reaffirmed &#x2026; is that above all else, people want leaders who are credible&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_34">2011</xref>, p. 16).</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_92">92</target>Credibility as a Peripheral Cue</title>
<p>Now that we&#x2019;ve explained what credibility is, we turn our attention to how and why it facilitates persuasion. To do so, we return to Petty and Cacioppo&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_51">1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_52">1986b</xref>) <italic>elaboration likelihood model</italic> of persuasion (ELM), which was introduced in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter2">Chapter 2</xref>. According to the ELM, there are two distinct routes to persuasion; a <italic>central route</italic> and a <italic>peripheral route</italic>. The central route, involves thinking or <italic>cognitive elaboration</italic>. The peripheral route relies on mental shortcuts or <italic>heuristic cues</italic>.</p>
<p>Petty and Cacioppo conceptualize credibility as a peripheral cue to persuasion. When receivers have little at stake, their motivation to pay attention to a message is lower. They therefore tend to favor the peripheral route. As a general rule, source credibility exerts more influence on receivers who aren&#x2019;t highly involved in an issue. Credibility matters far less if receiver involvement is already high. Instead, credibility tends to work its magic when receiver involvement is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_7">Benoit, 1987</xref>). Receivers with low involvement are more likely to defer to sources, because doing so requires less mental effort than concentrating on the substance of a message. To put it bluntly, low-involved receivers are cognitively lazy. This limitation notwithstanding, we mustn&#x2019;t underestimate the importance of credibility. Credibility may be conceptualized as a peripheral cue, but it is still a big peripheral cue.</p>
<p>You can use this information to your advantage if you are trying to persuade receivers who perceive you as having low credibility. You should do everything you can to increase their involvement in the topic or issue. Explain why the issue is relevant to them. Emphasize how the topic or issue affects them directly. If you can increase your target audience&#x2019;s involvement in the topic or issue, they&#x2019;ll pay more attention to the message and less attention to your credibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4_6">
<title>It&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s Up Front that Counts</title>
<p>When should a source&#x2019;s expertise be identified&#x2014;at the beginning or end of a persuasive message? Research findings strongly suggest that credibility tends to work only if the source is identified <italic>prior</italic> to the actual presentation of a persuasive message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_9">Benoit &#x0026; Strathman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_47">Nan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_48">O&#x2019;Keefe, 1987</xref>). If the source is identified after the fact, credibility has little or no effect. Several studies, for example, found no differences in the persuasiveness of high- versus low-credibility sources when the sources were identified after the messages were presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_48">O&#x2019;Keefe, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_72">Ward &#x0026; McGinnies, 1974</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_9">Benoit and Strathman (2004)</xref> suggest that this is because credibility affects the way receivers process a message. For credibility to do any good, therefore, receivers must consider the source&#x2019;s credibility as they process a persuasive message.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4_7">
<title>The Sleeper Effect</title>
<p>The traditional view is that the impact of a persuasive message wanes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_28">Hovland, Lumsdaine, &#x0026; Sheffield, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_64">Stiff, 1994</xref>). Receivers forget what was said or who said it. Persuasion wears off. The <italic>sleeper effect</italic>, however, suggests that under the right circumstances, the delayed impact of a message may be more effective than <target target-type="page" id="page_93">93</target>its initial impact (Kumkale &#x0026; Albarrac&#x00ED;n, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_36">2004</xref>)&#x2014;that is, the message might grow on receivers. Specifically, the sleeper effect posits that a message from a low-credibility source may increase in persuasiveness as time passes, compared to a message from a high-credibility source. Sound unlikely? It is, to some extent. Yet the sleeper effect has been documented by researchers, dating back more than 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_28">Hovland et al., 1949</xref>). How the sleeper effect works requires some explanation.</p>
<p>Imagine that one audience is exposed to a persuasive message from a source with high credibility. A second audience is exposed to the same persuasive message, but from a source with low credibility, by means of a <italic>discounting cue</italic>. A discounting cue consists of a disclaimer containing negative information about the source, the message, or both. For example, let&#x2019;s say the first group heard a message in favor of irradiating fruits and vegetables to kill bacteria before they are shipped to market. The second group would hear the same message, plus a disclaimer saying the message was drafted by a lobbyist for the agricultural industry whose real concern was agricultural profits, not consumer safety. The discounting cue would thus serve as an impediment to the effectiveness of the second message, a &#x201C;ball and chain,&#x201D; so to speak. Afterward, each group&#x2019;s attitudes toward irradiated produce would be measured.</p>
<p>Initially, the first group&#x2019;s attitudes should be much more favorable toward the topic than the second group&#x2019;s. After all, the first group heard the message from the high-credibility source. With the passage of time, however, things might change. The first group&#x2019;s attitudes would gradually decay over time. The second group&#x2019;s attitudes, however, might undergo a process known as <italic>disassociation,</italic> whereby the message is separated from its source in the minds of receivers. The second group might remember the message, but forget the discounting cue. If you&#x2019;ve ever heard someone say, &#x201C;I heard somewhere that &#x2026;&#x201D; or &#x201C;I read somewhere that &#x2026;&#x201D; you&#x2019;ve observed disassociation in action. Once the message was decoupled from its source, the ball and chain would be removed. The result would be that as the first group&#x2019;s attitudes diminished, the second group&#x2019;s attitudes would become more positive. <italic>Voil&#x00E0;</italic>! The sleeper effect.</p>
<p>Although the sleeper effect has been demonstrated in laboratory studies (Kumkale &#x0026; Albarrac&#x00ED;n, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_36">2004</xref>), it is difficult to produce on a consistent, reliable basis. Only a few studies have demonstrated an <italic>absolute</italic> sleeper effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4_3">Figure 4.3</xref>) of the type we&#x2019;ve been discussing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_26">Gruder et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_73">Watts &#x0026; Holt, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_74">Watts &#x0026; McGuire, 1964</xref>). An absolute sleeper effect occurs when a message from a high-credibility source loses favor over time, whereas a message from a low-credibility source gains favor over time. Other studies have demonstrated a <italic>relative</italic> sleeper effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4_3">Figure 4.3</xref>), meaning that both messages lose favor over time, but the high-credibility message loses more favor than the low-credibility message (see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_2">Allen &#x0026; Stiff, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_3">1998</xref>). Some studies have failed to find a sleeper effect at all (see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_2">Allen &#x0026; Stiff, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_3">1998</xref>). The sleeper effect, then, can be pretty fickle.</p>

<graphic orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fig4_3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>There is evidence, however, that fictional narratives can induce the sleeper effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_4">Appel &#x0026; Richter, 2007</xref>). Over time, a person may forget what was fact and what was fiction, and come to believe a fictional storyline. What implications does this hold for you as a persuader? In practice, it would be very difficult for an ordinary persuader, <target target-type="page" id="page_94">94</target>as opposed to a laboratory researcher, to satisfy all of the requirements for obtaining a sleeper effect. We believe there are far too many &#x201C;ifs&#x201D; associated with this strategy to recommend it to an ordinary persuader. Our advice is that you would be much better off trying to enhance your credibility as much as possible in the first place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4_8">
<title>Credibility and Image Management</title>
<p>Thus far, we&#x2019;ve discussed credibility strictly in connection with people. We believe the concept of credibility can be extended to corporations, organizations, governmental agencies, social movements, and other institutions as well. Such group entities care about how they are perceived by the public and other constituencies. They want to project positive images. And to a large extent, their power and ability to influence are linked to their images and their reputations. For these reasons, we maintain that the credibility construct applies equally well to institutional entities and individuals. Britain&#x2019;s slogan, &#x201C;keep calm and carry on,&#x201D; for example, embodies the dimension of composure for an entire nation.</p>
<p>As further illustration, consider the charitable activities of major corporations. McDonald&#x2019;s established Ronald McDonald House to provide assistance to hospital-bound children and their families. The National Football League donates generously to the United Way. Other companies contribute to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. In so doing, these corporations are demonstrating that they are good citizens in their communities. Doing good deeds enhances public perceptions of goodwill. We aren&#x2019;t suggesting that corporations are disingenuous when they sponsor causes or that corporate altruism is based solely on the profit motive. We do wish to point out, however, that philanthropic acts make for good public relations.</p>
<p>So important is image management for corporations, institutions, government agencies, and the like that entire departments, divisions, and staffs exist for just this purpose. They may be called publicists, press agents, mouthpieces, or spin doctors, but their goal is the same: to generate favorable publicity and avoid unfavorable <target target-type="page" id="page_95">95</target>media coverage. Even the military employs public relations officers, because good PR is part of good military strategy. Whatever the title of these types of positions, one of their primary missions is to maintain the credibility of the host institution.</p>
<p>On occasion, corporations, institutions, and government agencies commit blunders that damage their credibility. For example, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico made BP the poster boy for evil oil companies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_8">William Benoit (1995)</xref> refers to this process as <italic>image restoration</italic> and notes that such efforts are highly persuasive in nature (p. 6). Examples in which circumstances have forced corporations and other institutions to engage in image restoration abound. Volkswagen&#x2019;s credibility took a hit when it admitted that 11 million of its diesel engine cars were fitted with software designed to defeat emissions tests. Thus far, the automaker has paid out &#x0024;20 billion in fines, with more in the offing. VW ran a series of ads apologizing to customers and promising to make things right. Wells Fargo piqued consumers&#x2019; ire when it created 3.5 million bogus accounts without their customers&#x2019; permission. Soon after the company launched a &#x201C;make things right&#x201D; campaign. United Airlines suffered a public relations nightmare when airport security forcibly removed a passenger from one of its airplanes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_8">Benoit (1995)</xref> notes that such defensive campaigns are commonplace. They are undertaken out of a necessity to restore the credibility of the corporation, institution, or agency whose image has been tarnished. Benoit highlights a variety of strategies aimed at image restoration. The specific strategies employed, of course, depend on the nature of the difficulty in which the institution finds itself and the range of available defenses.</p>
<p>We can see, then, that corporations and other institutions, not only individuals, possess credibility in varying amounts. We suspect that the same primary dimensions of credibility that apply to individuals apply equally well to corporations. We suspect that the secondary dimensions of credibility discussed previously, however, might differ. After all, the secondary dimensions don&#x2019;t always appear in studies of individuals&#x2019; credibility. This would appear to be a fruitful topic for future scholarly inquiry.</p>

<title>Interpersonal Credibility, Impression Management, Facework, and Accounts</title>
<p>Ordinary folks can&#x2019;t hire their own public relations firm or employ a publicist to maintain a positive public image. They do engage in public relations campaigns, nonetheless. Ordinary persons tend to function as their own PR departments through impression management and facework.</p>
<p><italic>Impression management theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_66">Tedeschi &#x0026; Reiss, 1981</xref>) seeks to explain how persons go about trying to project a positive self-image.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4_2"><sup>2</sup></xref> Individuals want others to form favorable impressions of them. In short, individuals want to be perceived as credible and likable. The importance of likability, specifically, is featured in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box4_2">Box 4.2</xref>. Individuals attempt to manage others&#x2019; impressions of themselves by trying to say and do the right things. Engaging in &#x201C;politically correct&#x201D; behavior is an example of impression management at work.</p>
<p>Our position is that when an individual is engaging in impression management, he or she is engaging in persuasion. He or she is attempting to influence others&#x2019; <target target-type="page" id="page_96">96</target>impressions of him or her. At the same time, he or she is vulnerable to influence attempts by others. This is because persons are highly susceptible to persuasive appeals aimed at enhancing their own self-image. By way of illustration, a common preoccupation of teenagers, especially younger teens, is &#x201C;looking cool.&#x201D; If one teen can convince another that dressing or acting a certain way will make him or her look &#x201C;cool,&#x201D; the other teen is likely to conform to that style of dress or behavior. Most of us need look no further than our high school yearbooks to realize that we, too, were susceptible to the fads, trends, and fashions of our day.</p>

<caption><title>Icing on the Cake: The Benefits of Likability</title></caption>
<p>Suppose you are choosing which of two tour guides to hire. Both are equally knowledgeable and experienced. Their tour prices are the same and include the same itinerary. One guide, however, is more friendly and likable, the other more distant and aloof. Which one would you choose? If you are like us, you would rather spend your day with the more likable guide. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_23">Gitomer (2015)</xref> observes, &#x201C;all things being equal, people prefer to do business with people they like. All things being not so equal, people still prefer to do business with people they like&#x201D; (p. 10).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_38">Lovas and Holloway (2009)</xref> explain that &#x201C;likability is a combination of characteristics including (but not limited to) interest, empathy and genuineness. In a professional context, likable people tend to be interesting to us, interested in us, empathetic, positive, non-judgmental, and genuine&#x201D; (p. 40). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_60">Sanders (2006)</xref>, who refers to likability as the &#x201C;L-factor,&#x201D; defines likability as &#x201C;an ability to create positive attitudes in other people through the delivery of emotional and psychological benefits&#x201D; (p. 33). Interestingly, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were the two most unlikable presidential candidates since modern polling began (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_27">Holyk &#x0026; Langer, 2016</xref>). In contrast, Bernie Sanders was rated the most likable candidate in 2016. Other likable public figures include Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Hanks, Chris Pratt, and Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>While important, likability only goes so far. If you were having brain surgery, would you prefer the best surgeon available or a lesser surgeon with a great bedside manner? For women in politics or the business world, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_17">Cooper (2013)</xref> argues that being likable and competent entails a double standard. Strong, successful women may be labeled as &#x201C;aggressive,&#x201D; &#x201C;abrasive,&#x201D; or &#x201C;difficult.&#x201D; She suggests that, for women, success and likability are often negatively correlated.</p>

<p>Impression management also requires that people engage in <italic>facework,</italic> a term coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_24">Erving Goffman (1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_25">1974</xref>). A person&#x2019;s &#x201C;face&#x201D; refers to his or her social standing in the eyes of others. Facework involves negotiating one&#x2019;s social standing and social worth with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_69">Ting-Toomey, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_70">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_71">Ting-Toomey &#x0026; Kurogi, 1998</xref>). For example, committing a social faux pas could result in the loss of one&#x2019;s own face. Facework would be required to restore one&#x2019;s face. Threatening or challenging another person could cause the other to lose face. Facework would again be required for the other to regain face.</p>
<p>As with identity management, we suggest that facework is inherently persuasive in nature. Facework involves goal-oriented communication that seeks particular outcomes or ends&#x2014;namely, &#x201C;satisfying one&#x2019;s own face wants and the face wants of one&#x2019;s interlocutor&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_19">Cupach &#x0026; Imahori, 1993</xref>, p. 117). For example, consider the related social rituals of asking someone out on a date and declining someone&#x2019;s invitation for a date. Both rituals, asking and declining, are persuasive in nature, and both are laden with face-saving implications. Although not synonymous with credibility, we see the concepts of face and facework as being closely related to the credibility construct. Maintaining one&#x2019;s face, we believe, is akin to maintaining one&#x2019;s credibility in the eyes of others.</p>

<title>Strategies for Enhancing Credibility: Get Your Mojo Working</title>
<p>Having gained a better understanding of what credibility is and how it works, what can you do to enhance your credibility when persuading? A number of general guidelines are offered for improving your credibility. Keep in mind that because credibility is a receiver-based construct, what works on one listener or audience may not work on the next.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Heed the Boy Scout motto: &#x201C;Be prepared.&#x201D;</italic> Before making your case, be as well prepared and well organized as possible. Think through your position beforehand and anticipate likely objections to your position. If you don&#x2019;t seem to know what you are talking about, your credibility will suffer. Research shows that unorganized messages are far less convincing than organized ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_42">McCroskey &#x0026; Mehrley, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_61">Sharp &#x0026; McClung, 1966</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Cite evidence for your position and identify the sources of your evidence.</italic> In a review of the effects of evidence usage, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_54">Reinard (1988)</xref> concluded that in almost all cases, citing evidence and sources significantly enhanced speaker credibility. This advice applies especially to low-credibility sources.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><target target-type="page" id="page_98">98</target><italic>Cite your own or your sources&#x2019; qualifications and expertise on the topic or issue up front.</italic> Remember, expertise is one of the primary dimensions of credibility. For credibility to enhance persuasion, however, the source&#x2019;s credentials must be identified prior to presenting the message. If you have expertise on a topic or an issue, let your listener(s) know. If you lack expertise on an issue, don&#x2019;t dwell on your deficiencies. Instead, explain how you came to develop an interest in the subject. Also, consider this: If, in fact, you know little or nothing about a topic, then you have no business trying to persuade others about that topic in the first place.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Attempt to build trust by demonstrating to your listener that you are honest and sincere.</italic> One approach is to demonstrate that you possess good moral character. Another is to acknowledge that although compliance would benefit you, it would benefit the other person as well; compliance would be in both parties&#x2019; mutual interest.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Display goodwill toward your audience.</italic> Don&#x2019;t seem aloof or indifferent. Show that you care about others, that you understand their ideas and their situation, that you empathize with their feelings and views, and that you are attentive and responsive to their communication attempts. For example, if a listener asks you a question, begin your answer by saying, &#x201C;If I heard you correctly, you want to know &#x2026;&#x201D; and end by asking, &#x201C;Does that address what you were asking?&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Improve your likability, or L-factor.</italic> Likability affects how you and your message are received. Some view likability as a form of emotional intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_60">Sanders, 2006</xref>). You can improve your L-factor by conveying warmth and immediacy. Smile often. Remember people&#x2019;s names. Listen. Thank people and accept compliments sincerely. Being genuine and authentic goes a long way.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Adopt a language and delivery style appropriate to the listener(s), topic, and setting.</italic> Your style of speech should be tailored to your particular receiver(s). Different receivers have different needs. In general, nonfluencies, pauses or gaps, and a choppy style of delivery hinder credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_11">Berger, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_12">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_46">Miller &#x0026; Hewgill, 1964</xref>). A reliance on &#x201C;uhms,&#x201D; &#x201C;ahs,&#x201D; and other fillers impairs credibility as well. An overreliance on slang, colloquialisms, or trite expressions can also compromise credibility.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Avoid a powerless style of communication. Use an assertive style of communication instead.</italic> A powerless communication style involves using tag questions (&#x201C;That was a good movie, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201D;), hesitations (&#x201C;uhm,&#x201D; &#x201C;uh&#x201D;), qualifiers (&#x201C;kind of,&#x201D; &#x201C;sort of,&#x201D; &#x201C;perhaps,&#x201D; &#x201C;maybe&#x201D;), and negative preambles (&#x201C;This will probably sound really dumb, but &#x2026;&#x201D;). A reliance on powerless language signals to the other party that you perceive yourself as occupying a lower status position in the relationship. For more about this topic, refer to <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter7">Chapter 7</xref>, in which we examine the role of language in persuasion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Emphasize your similarity to another to indirectly enhance your credibility.</italic> Listeners find it easier to identify with sources they perceive as similar to themselves. O&#x2019;Keefe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4_49">2002</xref>) points out two important caveats regarding similarity and influence. First, he emphasizes, the similarities must be relevant to the topic or issue. Commenting, &#x201C;Hey, I&#x2019;m a Libra, too!&#x201D; will probably get you nowhere unless the topic happens to center on astrology, horoscopes, and other similar topics. Second, O&#x2019;Keefe notes that the perceived similarities must involve positive, <target target-type="page" id="page_99">99</target>rather than negative, qualities. Stressing, &#x201C;I was arrested for shoplifting once, too&#x201D; may not enamor you to a new acquaintance, even though he or she may have confessed to a similar mistake.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If you think you are perceived as having low credibility, try to increase receiver involvement and emphasize the central route to persuasion. Remember, receivers who are highly involved in a topic place less emphasis on source credibility and more emphasis on the substance of a message. If you suspect your target audience is skeptical of your credibility, explain how the topic or issue is directly relevant to them and then focus on the substance of the message. That will tend to encourage central processing on the part of your audience.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have another source who is already perceived as highly credible introduce or endorse you. This is a common strategy used in election campaigns. Salespersons also use this strategy when they rely on referrals. The technique allows a source to piggyback on the established credibility of the person making the introduction or endorsement. Acquiring credibility via endorsements and introductions emphasizes the peripheral route to persuasion.</p></list-item>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>As we&#x2019;ve seen, credibility is a complex construct. Yet there is one overriding generalization about credibility that persuaders can &#x201C;take to the bank&#x201D;: <italic>Credibility is a good thing to have if you are a persuader.</italic> As long as we keep in mind that credibility is a perceptual phenomenon, the generalization that high-credibility sources are more influential than low-credibility sources is as close as one can come to a universal &#x201C;law&#x201D; of persuasion.</p>
<p>In advancing this generalization, however, we believe it is important to underscore the point that credibility is a complex, multidimensional, situational communication phenomenon. Credibility can&#x2019;t be bought in a bottle or purchased out of a vending machine. In many persuasive settings, a source who has low or no initial credibility can do little or nothing about it. Low-credibility sources tend to be dismissed out of hand; receivers simply fail to attend to their messages. There is an old joke about how to become a multimillionaire: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s simple: First, get a million dollars, then &#x2026;&#x201D; Much the same advice can be offered for using credibility to enhance persuasion: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s simple: First, get a lot of credibility, then &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_105">105</target>DO YOU HAVE A CELEBRITY CRUSH? Have you ever dreamt of Kerry Washington or Zac Efron? Spent hours on the Internet stalking Harry Styles or Jessica Alba? Retweeted or liked posts by Scarlett or Channing? Better yet, have you ever wondered whether your celebrity crush would like you back? Fortunately, for Spencer Morrill of Knoxville, Tennessee, the answer to that last question was &#x201C;no!&#x201D; Indeed, his celebrity crush&#x2014;the megastar pop singer, Katy Perry&#x2014;told him that she loved him &#x2026; or so he thought. Sadly, after &#x201C;dating&#x201D; Katy online for six years, after making her an engagement ring out of his great-grandmother&#x2019;s emerald, and after blowing 25 percent of his savings, Spencer learned that &#x201C;Katy&#x201D; was really a woman named Harriet from England. Spencer, it turns out, had been duped in what is commonly known as an online &#x201C;catfish scheme,&#x201D; in which the scammer pretends to be someone he or she is not. His ordeal was later featured on the MTV series <italic>Catfish</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_23">Delbyck, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re at all like us, you might be wondering how anyone could fall for such a hoax, especially for such a long period of time. But then again, when you consider all possible people, it&#x2019;s likely that someone would be gullible enough to fall for such a scheme.</p>
<p>However, although it seems that some people are more persuadable than others, the search for a single underlying trait or characteristic that makes people persuadable has not been successful. Persuasion is more complicated than that. And so are people. Even so, the characteristics of the people in a persuasive interaction cannot be ignored. All communicators are unique in terms of gender, age, personality, and background, and such characteristics are important to understanding the nature of social influence.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we explore the role communicator characteristics play in the process of persuasion. Although we don&#x2019;t have room to cover the immense number of characteristics that have been studied, we discuss several that past research has identified as being important to social influence. Then we discuss ways in which a communicator might analyze and adapt to an audience when trying to be persuasive. Before we begin, however, we note, as we have in earlier chapters, that persuasion is a two-way street. Thus, when we use the term <italic>communicator characteristics,</italic> we are not limiting our discussion to one person. The characteristics of all the interactants in a persuasive encounter are part of the equation.</p>
<sec id="sec5_1">
<title>Demographic Variables and Persuasion</title>
<p>If someone asked you to use 10 words to describe yourself, there is a good chance you would use demographic information to do so. Demographics include characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, and intelligence, which we discuss in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="sec5_1_1">
<title>Age and Persuasion: Pretty Please With Sugar on Top</title>
<p>The expression &#x201C;It&#x2019;s like taking candy from a baby&#x201D; suggests that children are easy targets for persuasion, and research indicates that this is generally true: Children tend to be especially vulnerable to persuasive trickery because they lack the ability to understand the nature and intent of persuaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_65">McAlister &#x0026; Cornwell, 2009</xref>). <target target-type="page" id="page_106">106</target>The implications of such research can be frightening. Indeed, we&#x2019;ve all heard stories of children who have been tricked or lured away by criminals (for more on this issue, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box5_1">Box 5.1</xref>).</p>
<p>What we may be less aware of, however, are other types of messages that may be persuading our children, or, for that matter, our fetuses! As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_57">Lindstrom (2011</xref>, p. 15) noted, because strong tastes and aromas (such as garlic and vanilla) pass through a mother&#x2019;s amniotic fluid and are actually &#x201C;tasted&#x201D; by a fetus, even unborn kids may be influenced to develop tastes inside the womb. He reported, for example, that Kopiko, a candy brand in the Philippines, supplied doctors with coffee-flavored candies to give away to pregnant mothers. Some time later, Kopiko introduced a new product&#x2014;coffee&#x2014;which was phenomenally successful, particularly among children in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Once outside the womb, it doesn&#x2019;t take long before kids are bombarded by the world of advertising. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_57">Lindstrom (2011)</xref>, for example, by three months, 40 percent of all infants watch screen media regularly, and by two years, 90 percent of all children do. What&#x2019;s more, in the United States, typical kids are exposed to 40,000 commercials a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_53">Kunkel, Wilcox, Cantor, Palmer, Linn, &#x0026; Dowrick, 2004</xref>). These numbers become especially meaningful when you understand that advertisers do not always have children&#x2019;s best interests in mind. According to Lindstrom&#x2019;s sources (2011, p. 22), for instance, the clothing retailer Abercrombie <target target-type="page" id="page_107">107</target>&#x0026; Fitch marketed padded bikini tops to girls as young as eight, and Tesco, a retailer in the UK, released the &#x201C;Peekaboo Pole Dancing Kit,&#x201D; marketed to females under 10, as something to help them &#x201C;unleash the sex kitten inside.&#x201D;</p>

<disp-quote>
<p>I was certain it could never happen. After all, I&#x2019;m a very street-savvy, New York City parent. I write articles advising moms and dads on child safety. Needless to say, I&#x2019;ve been so conscientious in teaching my own children that my husband insists I&#x2019;m paranoid, and my daughter has more than once rolled her eyes heavenward at my often repeated warnings. Which is why I can hardly describe the sick feeling in my stomach as I watched my redheaded little boy and his friend Tahlor march right out of the park one spring afternoon with a total stranger.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Margery Rosen, this scene was only part of an informal experiment. To test how well she had trained her children, she had gotten Kenneth Wooden, an expert on the ways in which sex offenders lure children, to see if he could persuade her children to leave the playground with him. He didn&#x2019;t have much trouble. He told the boys he had lost a puppy and would give them money if they would help him find it. They went right with him, and so did several other children involved in the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_88">Rosen, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Many children aren&#x2019;t as fortunate as those involved in Rosen&#x2019;s experiment. Indeed, it&#x2019;s been estimated that one in four girls and one in six boys are sexually abused by age 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_115">Wooden, 2014</xref>). Clearly, children are especially susceptible to persuasion, and sometimes the results are tragic. For that reason, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_113">Kenneth Wooden (1988)</xref> argued, &#x201C;Teaching your kids about the tricks that molesters use could save them from grievous harm&#x2014;even death&#x201D; (p. 149).</p>
<p>In an effort to prevent children from being molested, Wooden interviewed convicted molesters, pimps, and murderers and discovered several lures that are commonly used on children. Of the lures he said, &#x201C;Knowledge of them is so basic to a child&#x2019;s safety that they should be taught&#x2014;indeed must be <target target-type="page" id="page_108">108</target>taught&#x2014;by every parent&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_113">Wooden, 1988</xref>, p. 149). With this in mind, if you know, are, or plan to be a parent, here is an abbreviated list of lures and prevention strategies that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_114">Wooden (1995</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_25">Dickinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_88">Rosen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_113">Wooden, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_116">Wooden, Webb, &#x0026; Mitchell, 2014</xref>) identified:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The assistance lure. The lost puppy example described previously is an example of this lure. In it, the pedophile asks kids for directions, for help carrying packages, or for some other type of assistance. Children should be advised to keep their distance from strangers in cars. Children should tell the assistance seeker to ask another adult for help.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The authority and hero lures. Some molesters lure children by posing as police officers, Santa Claus, or other figures that children trust. Children should be taught that bad people can play tricks on children and that real heroes won&#x2019;t do certain things.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The affection/love lure. Some pedophiles lure children by promising them love and affection. Parents should know that 75 to 80 percent of sex crimes are committed by someone a child knows and trusts. Children should beware of anyone who wants excessive time alone with them and be encouraged to tell their parents about improper advances. Parents should trust their instincts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The bribery lure. Children are often offered gifts from molesters. Parents should be suspicious of any new toys their children have. The age-old saying &#x201C;Never take candy from strangers&#x201D; is still true today.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The ego/fame lure. Youngsters are sometimes lured by modeling jobs or beauty contests that should be kept secret from mom and dad. For that reason, parents should accompany kids to such events, encourage openness, and check the credentials of &#x201C;would-be&#x201D; modeling agencies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The emergency lure. Molesters might trick children by claiming &#x201C;a house is on fire&#x201D; or &#x201C;mommy had to go to the hospital.&#x201D; To prevent falling for this, parents and children should prearrange an emergency plan. Under no circumstance should a child ride with a stranger.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The fun and games lure. Molesters sometimes turn tickling, wrestling, and other games into intimate contact. Children need to be taught that there are good and bad touches. Bad touches (e.g., anywhere under a bathing suit) should be reported.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The pornography lure. Pedophiles have been known to use pornography to destroy their victims&#x2019; inhibitions. Wooden, therefore, advises parents to keep pornography out of the home so it does not seem legitimate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The jobs lure. Molesters sometimes lure children by promising high-paying jobs. When suspicious, parents should accompany children to interviews, especially if the interview is in a secluded or unusual place, and ask to see a business license.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Finally, parents and children need to be aware that the Internet has become a vehicle for strangers who prey on children. Parents should watch for warning signs, including pornography on a child&#x2019;s computer (often sent by sexual predators to desensitize victims) and telephone calls or mail from strangers (&#x201C;Beware &#x2019;Net predators,&#x201D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_7">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although some psychologists have argued that teaching children about a potential molester only serves to terrify them and prevent the formation of friendships (for a discussion, see Teaching fear, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_106">1986</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_88">Rosen (1994</xref>, 2014) and others have argued that teaching children to be cautious about potential molesters is little different from vaccinating them against a disease or teaching them to be safe around stoves or electrical sockets. Education should start at a young age, with the goal of making children cautious, not paranoid. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_113">Wooden (1988)</xref> noted, children should be taught that most people are good and won&#x2019;t hurt them but should also realize that some people are bad and sick.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Unfortunately, until age eight, children do not understand the persuasive nature of advertising. Instead, kids think that ads are just there to inform them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_74">Oates, Blades, &#x0026; Gunter, 2002</xref>). Worse yet, children may have an especially difficult time understanding the persuasive intent behind &#x201C;gamification,&#x201D; which promotes brands through fun and interactive online games (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_107">Vanwesenbeeck, Walrave, &#x0026; Ponnet, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_78">Panic, Cauberghe, &#x0026; De Palsmacker, 2013</xref>). Fortunately, however, at least two variables seem to decrease children&#x2019;s vulnerability to advertising: adult influence and getting older. First, research shows that if you interact with children during ads, you can increase their ability to critically examine the ads and provide them with a better understanding of the nature and purpose of advertising. One study, for example, found that when adults made factual (e.g., &#x201C;Those ads aren&#x2019;t telling the truth. Those toys look different in real life.&#x201D;) or evaluative (&#x201C;These ads are dumb. These toys aren&#x2019;t fun.&#x201D;) comments during advertisements, children were less persuaded by the ads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_12">Buijzen, 2007</xref>). Second, as children become older, they become less susceptible to distorted claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_69">Mills &#x0026; Elashi, 2014</xref>). Notice, however, we say <italic>less</italic> susceptible, not immune. For example, Morgenstern, Isensee, Sargent, and Harwinkel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_70">2011</xref>) found that teenagers who were exposed to a greater number of alcohol advertisements consumed larger amounts of alcohol.</p>
<p>So far, we&#x2019;ve made it clear that young people tend to be highly susceptible to persuasion. But what about older people? Although earlier studies indicated that elderly people may be more &#x201C;set in their ways,&#x201D; and, thus, less persuadable than younger folks, a newer generation of research supports the <italic>life-stages hypothesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_92">Sears, 1981</xref>), which suggests that there is a curvilinear relationship between age and persuadability (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_27">Eaton, Visser, Krosnick, &#x0026; Anand, 2009</xref>). In other words, compared to youthful and elderly people, middle-aged people are less persuadable. Consistent with this hypothesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_56">Liao and Fu (2014)</xref> found that, compared to younger adults (19&#x2013;26), older adults (58&#x2013;80) were less skilled at judging the credibility of online health information. This is troubling, of course, considering that older people are frequent users of health information, even though the content of health-related websites is often rated as unsatisfactory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_56">Liao &#x0026; Fu, 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Gender Differences and Persuasion: The Times, They Aren&#x2019;t a-Changin&#x2019;</title>
<p>Do men and women differ in their ability to influence others? Before you answer, we should warn you: This is a trick question. Although the lion&#x2019;s share of research reveals that men are more successful than women in their attempts to persuade others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_14">Carli, 2004</xref>), their success has little to do with ability but rather a double-standard in audiences&#x2019; perceptions. This conclusion is supported by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_14">Carli (2004)</xref>, who demonstrated that gender stereotypes cause audiences to perceive males as more competent than females and to expect females to be warmer and more nurturing than males. As a result, women experience a double bind: They must perform better than men to be considered equally competent, and they are perceived negatively when they try to be direct, assertive, and forceful. In one study, for instance, when females adopted aggressive communication behaviors in debates, they were judged more <target target-type="page" id="page_109">109</target>harshly than males who adopted the same behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_63">Matthews, 2016</xref>). Similarly, a meta-analysis found that women were less persuasive when they used aggressive and assertive tactics than when they used more role-consistent, communal tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_101">Smith, Watkins, Burke, Christian, Smith, Hall, &#x0026; Simms, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with this finding is Klingle&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_49">2004</xref>) <italic>reinforcement expectancy theory,</italic> which applies to persuasive encounters between doctors and patients. According to the theory, once a doctor has tried to persuade a patient to do something (e.g., take medication), the patient judges the appropriateness of the doctor&#x2019;s message. If the message is viewed as inappropriate, the patient rejects it. If it is viewed as appropriate, it guides the patient&#x2019;s future behavior. How does this relate to gender? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_49">Klingle (2004)</xref>, because of certain norms, female doctors can&#x2019;t get away with using aversive strategies the same way that male doctors can. When female doctors use such strategies, they violate patients&#x2019; expectations about what is appropriate, and, as a result, patients are less likely to comply. According to the theory, then, male doctors can increase compliance by using either positive (e.g., &#x201C;Regular eating will make you feel so much better&#x201D;) or negative (&#x201C;You have two choices&#x2014;change your diet or spend the rest of your life wishing you had&#x201D;) influence strategies, but female doctors can increase compliance by using only positive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_49">Klingle, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to having double standards about the use of various persuasive strategies, people also hold stereotypes about who seems better suited for selling certain products. In one study (Rodero, Larrea, &#x0026; V&#x00E1;zquez, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_86">2013</xref>), for example, people listened to various radio advertisements that featured male or female voices. Results indicated that people perceived the male voice as more appropriate for selling mechanical products and the female voice as more appropriate for selling body-hair removal products. No differences were observed for neutral products.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we&#x2019;ve seen that men and women differ regarding how successful they are when trying to persuade other people. But how do men and women compare when it comes to being persuaded? Early research suggested that women were more easily persuaded than men (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_15">Chaiken, 1979</xref>). Later, however, researchers who examined and summarized large numbers of studies on the topic questioned the notion of whether women were any different from men when it came to being persuaded (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_26">Eagly, 1978</xref>). As a result, many researchers abandoned the idea of general gender effects and instead tried to explain <italic>when</italic> gender differences could be expected. For instance, in Eagly&#x2019;s 1978 study, 32 percent of the studies published before 1970 (generally regarded as the onset of the women&#x2019;s movement) found that women were more easily influenced than men, but only 8 percent of the studies published after 1970 found the same result. Thus, evaporating gender differences might be the result of changing times and the attitudes of and toward women. However, considering the research we have discussed on how gender stereotypes affect males&#x2019; versus females&#x2019; ability to persuade, we doubt that this explanation is correct.</p>
<p>Even so, there is another possible explanation for the change in research findings before and after 1970. Specifically, earlier studies used male rather than female sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_109">Ward, Seccombe, Bendel, &#x0026; Carter, 1985</xref>), which means that male receivers were being persuaded by members of the same sex, whereas females were being persuaded by members of the opposite sex&#x2014;that is, in the earlier studies, there may have been a <italic>cross-sex effect</italic>, by which people were more easily influenced by members <target target-type="page" id="page_110">110</target>of the opposite sex than by members of the same sex. This effect, however, may be stronger for males persuading females than for females persuading males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_109">Ward et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>From our review so far, it is clear that generalizations about gender and persuasion are hard to come by. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_17">Cody, Seiter, and Montagne-Miller (1995)</xref> argue, &#x201C;There is no simple model that links &#x2018;gender&#x2019; or &#x2018;sex&#x2019; to influenceability&#x201D; (p. 312). Instead, these researchers argue that persuadability is not so much related to one&#x2019;s gender as it is to one&#x2019;s goals, plans, resources, and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_17">Cody et al., 1995</xref>). For instance, imagine that you are in a shopping mall, looking at clothing. If you don&#x2019;t intend to buy anything (goal), have decided you will look now and buy later (plan), have very little money (resources), and think that all salespersons are dishonest (beliefs), you will probably be more difficult to influence than if you intend to buy now, have lots of money, and believe salespersons are honest. In other words, it may not matter so much whether you are male or female; how easy you are to influence depends on your goals, plans, resources, and beliefs. Gender matters only to the extent that males and females have different goals, plans, resources, and beliefs. For instance, Cody and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_17">1995</xref>) found that when shopping for clothes, men and women tend to have different goals and that such goal differences were related to influenceability and the effectiveness of certain sales tactics. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_77">Orji, Mandryk, &#x0026; Vassileva (2015)</xref> found that males and females differed in their responsiveness to different persuasive strategies.</p>

<title>Ethnicity, Culture, and Persuasion: &#x201C;Me&#x201D; and &#x201C;We&#x201D; Perspectives</title>
<p>Cultural differences play a major role, both in terms of how people fashion influence attempts and how they respond to them. Perhaps the most commonly discussed dimension of cultural variability is known as <italic>individualism&#x2013;collectivism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_39">Hofstede, 1983</xref>). Whereas people in collectivist cultures (e.g., China) tend to value harmony, concern for others, and the goals of the group over the goals of the individual, people in individualistic cultures (e.g., the United States) tend to value independence and the goals of the individual over the goals of a collective.</p>
<p>With that in mind, consider the following list of slogans (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_36">Han &#x0026; Shavitt, 1994</xref>, p. 346) and imagine which you would use to appeal to people in a collectivistic culture and which you would use to appeal to people in an individualistic culture:
<verse-group>
<verse-line>&#x201C;The art of being unique.&#x201D;</verse-line>
<verse-line>&#x201C;She&#x2019;s got a style all her own.&#x201D;</verse-line>
<verse-line>&#x201C;We have a way of bringing people closer together.&#x201D;</verse-line>
<verse-line>&#x201C;The dream of prosperity for all of us.&#x201D;</verse-line>
</verse-group>
</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_36">Han and Shavitt (1994)</xref> found that advertisements, such as the first and second in the previous list, that appealed to individual benefits, personal success, and independence were used more in the United States (an individualistic culture) than in Korea (a collectivistic culture) and were more persuasive in the United States than in Korea. Ads, such as the third and fourth, that appealed to group benefits, harmony, and family were used more often and were more persuasive in Korea than in the United States.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_111">111</target>Also consistent with the notion that people from collectivistic cultures focus on groups and relationships, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_31">Fu and Yukl (2000)</xref> found that Chinese managers rated &#x201C;emphasizing coalitions&#x201D; and &#x201C;gift-giving&#x201D; among the most effective influence tactics, whereas managers from the United States preferred rational persuasion. Similarly, a study by Wiseman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_112">2009</xref>) found differences between the persuasive strategies used by people from the United States, China, and Japan. For example, when trying to persuade roommates to be more quiet, people from the United States, who tend to be more individualistic and less concerned with saving face, preferred more direct strategies (e.g., &#x201C;You are making too much noise. Please be quiet&#x201D;) and strategies with individually controlled sanctions (&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t quiet down, I&#x2019;ll be as noisy as possible when you are trying to study&#x201D;). People from China, who tend to be more collectivistic, preferred indirect strategies (e.g., commenting on how they like quiet moments) and strategies with group-controlled sanctions (e.g., &#x201C;Your noisiness shows a lack of consideration for others&#x201D;). However, people from Japan hinted less than people from both the United States and China, leading Wiseman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_112">2009</xref>) to conclude that collectivism and individualism may not be opposite orientations. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_2">Agrawal (2015)</xref> suggested that people from individualistic cultures can sometimes be primed to behave in collectivistic ways and vice versa. For example, someone from an individualistic culture might be asked to think about family obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_2">Agrawal, 2015</xref>). As such, sometimes culturally incongruent messages can be persuasive.</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to individualism&#x2013;collectivism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_77">Orji (2015)</xref> identified several additional cultural differences. Specifically, people from collectivistic cultures perceived appeals to authority (e.g., expertise), consensus (e.g., others are doing it, so you should too), liking, and reciprocity (e.g., you are obligated to give back) as more persuasive than did people from individualistic cultures.</p>
<p>Although individualism and collectivism are important values affecting cross-cultural differences in persuasion, they are not the only ones. For example, after conducting interviews with people from the People&#x2019;s Republic of China and Taiwan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_59">Ma and Chuang (2001)</xref> identified three influence tactics reflecting additional values of importance. First, <italic>anshi,</italic> or &#x201C;hinting&#x201D; (e.g., telling a friend who loaned you money that you&#x2019;d like to buy something if you weren&#x2019;t broke), compared to more direct strategies (e.g., demanding the money a friend borrowed), not only preserves harmony in a relationship, it is more respectful and seeks to save another person&#x2019;s face. Second, <italic>yi shen zuo ze,</italic> or &#x201C;setting an example by one&#x2019;s own action&#x201D; (e.g., a manager works exceptionally hard hoping her subordinates will do likewise), reflects the Chinese culture&#x2019;s mistrust of words. Third, <italic>tou qi suo hao,</italic> or &#x201C;feeding people what they relish&#x201D; (e.g., agreeing to do something another person loves before asking a favor), reflects a preference for indirectness, other-orientedness, and granting people &#x201C;face&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_59">Ma &#x0026; Chuang, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_30">Fitch (1994)</xref> found that distinctive cultural systems of beliefs, values, and symbols underlie differences in the influence messages used by people in the United States and Colombia. A recurring theme in the influence strategies used in the United States was &#x201C;empowerment.&#x201D; For instance, a manager observed in Fitch&#x2019;s study argued:
<disp-quote>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_112">112</target>A stumbling block to empowerment is the low self-esteem of people who have been told what to do. If we want them to make their own decisions, we have to build up their self-esteem. And that starts with asking, not telling people what to do.</p>
<attrib>(p. 194)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In contrast, Colombians&#x2019; influence attempts centered on the concept of <italic>confianza</italic> (having trust or closeness in a relationship). For example, Colombians commonly ask intermediaries who have closer relationships with persuadees to deliver influence messages for them (e.g., &#x201C;You know Dioselina better than I do. Will you ask her to put up the signs?&#x201D;).</p>

<title>Intelligence and Persuasion: Dumb and Dumber</title>
<p>Imagine you were offered a million dollars to persuade either Forrest Gump (if you haven&#x2019;t seen the movie, Forrest isn&#x2019;t known for his brains) or Albert Einstein to believe or do something. Who would you choose? Earlier work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_67">McGuire, 1968</xref>) suggested that neither Forrest nor Albert&#x2014;but rather someone with moderate intelligence&#x2014;should be chosen. The idea was that Forrest would be difficult to persuade because he would be unable to comprehend a message, while Albert would be difficult because he would be better at scrutinizing a message. Later work, however, indicated that Forrest should be your choice. Indeed, a review of research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_85">Rhodes and Wood (1992)</xref> indicated that less intelligent people are easier to persuade than people with a lot of smarts. Even so, we imagine that other variables may be important too. More intelligent people may be in a better position to process complex messages. Recall that when central processing is required, the ability to process a message is important. Less intelligent people may be more receptive to simpler messages or messages that encourage peripheral processing.</p>

<title>Psychological and Communication States and Traits</title>
<p>Two common explanations for why people differ from one another centers on the notion of traits and states. A <italic>trait</italic> is a characteristic of a person presumed to be relatively stable across situations. A <italic>state</italic> varies from situation to situation. For instance, if we conceptualize anxiety as a trait, we would predict that a person possessing the trait would be anxious in practically all situations. On the other hand, if we conceptualize anxiety as a state, we would predict that there are certain situations in which a person becomes anxious. For instance, some people become very anxious when talking with authorities or when meeting members of the opposite sex. With these definitions in mind, we now turn to a discussion of some specific traits and states that have been the focus of research in the area of persuasion.</p>
<sec id="sec5_2_1">
<title>Self-Esteem and Persuasion: Feelin&#x2019; Kinda Low</title>
<p>Are individuals with low self-esteem more susceptible to influence attempts than individuals with high self-esteem? Although this notion seems reasonable, it is not supported by research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_85">Rhodes &#x0026; Wood, 1992</xref>). This is because to be persuaded, a person must both receive and yield to a message. People with low self-esteem may be more likely to yield to a message because they lack confidence in themselves and their <target target-type="page" id="page_113">113</target>opinions. However, they may also be too concerned about their appearance and behavior to be receptive to a persuasive message. On the other hand, people with high self-esteem may be more receptive to persuasive messages. However, because they are more confident in themselves and their own opinions, they may be less likely to yield. Thus, research indicates that people with moderately high self-esteem are easier to persuade than people with either high or low self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_85">Rhodes &#x0026; Wood, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Anxiety and Persuasion: Living in Fear</title>
<p>Unless you&#x2019;ve grown up in a closet, you&#x2019;ve undoubtedly been exposed to messages about the dangers of global warming, secondhand cigarette smoke, gang violence, and so forth. How do you react to such messages? Do they make you overly nervous or tense? If so, you may be chronically anxious. Research suggests that anxiety, whether chronic or acute, may be related to persuadability, although the relationship is not clear. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_73">Nunnally and Bobren (1959)</xref> found that anxious people were more persuadable than nonanxious people, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_44">Janis and Feshbach (1965)</xref> found just the opposite. Moreover, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_55">Lehmann (1970)</xref> indicated that anxiety is related to persuasion as much as self-esteem is. Specifically, anxious people, compared to the nonanxious, may be more likely to yield to a message. However, because they may be distracted or overly worried, they may be less likely to receive a message. On the other hand, nonanxious people, compared to the anxious, may be more likely to receive a message but less inclined to do something about it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_55">Lehmann, 1970</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_72">Nai, Schemeil, and Marie (2016)</xref> found that anxiety increases people&#x2019;s motivation to be accurate. As such, anxious folks, compared to calm ones, are more open to messages that challenge their opinions, and, as a result, are more persuadable.</p>
<p>Whatever the relationship between anxiety and persuasion, one thing is clear: When trying to persuade anxious people, be sure to include specific recommendations for avoiding the harms, along with reassurances that if they follow the recommendations, everything will be okay. As you&#x2019;ll see in more detail in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter13">Chapter 13</xref>, without such reassurances, people who are anxious may not respond well to fear appeals.</p>

<title>Preference for Consistency: I Wouldn&#x2019;t Change a Thing</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter3">Chapter 3</xref>, we stated that people are generally motivated to be consistent with their attitudes and behavior.

While &#x201C;high PFCs&#x201D; value and strive to be consistent, &#x201C;low PFCs&#x201D; have a preference for change, spontaneity, and unpredictability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_33">Guadagno &#x0026; Cialdini, 2010</xref>). As such, several studies indicate that high PFCs are more susceptible to the effects of cognitive dissonance. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_94">S&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;meaud, Mange, Fointiat, and Somat (2014)</xref> induced a group of French students to feel hypocritical, which, presumably, would cause dissonance. Specifically, after listing the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, the students were asked to consider previous situations in which they had consumed too much alcohol. Not surprisingly, compared to students who had not undergone this procedure, the &#x201C;hypocritical&#x201D; students were more willing to spend time helping young adults avoid alcohol abuse. This was especially true for high PFCs who had been made aware of their desire for consistency (S&#x00E9;n&#x00E9;meaud et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_90">2014</xref>) (for more on PFC, see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter10">Chapter 10</xref>).</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_114">114</target>Self-Monitoring and Persuasion: Periscope Up</title>
<p>In high school, a sister of one of the authors dated a guy who was a maniac on the dance floor. Out of context, you&#x2019;d never have guessed he was dancing. He used to stomp his feet and flap his hands wildly and out of rhythm. Some said he looked badly wounded. Others simply stared. But whatever went on around him, he seemed oblivious, not caring what others thought of him.</p>
<p>The account you&#x2019;ve just read is related to a personality trait called <italic>self-monitoring</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_102">Snyder, 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_103">1979</xref>). The wild dancer in the story is what people who study personality would call a <italic>low self-monitor.</italic> If you are a low self-monitor, you tend to be less sensitive than others to social cues. In addition, you are not that concerned about what others think of your behavior. You are individualistic and may not always act in ways that are considered socially appropriate. You honestly express your thoughts and feelings, even though you may not be conforming to other people&#x2019;s expectations.</p>
<p>However, if you are a <italic>high self-monitor</italic>, you tend to be very sensitive to social cues. You pay close attention to what&#x2019;s considered appropriate in a given situation and act accordingly. You watch other people&#x2019;s behavior and are good at adapting to different audiences because you have a large repertoire of social skills. You are concerned with appearances and try to &#x201C;fit in&#x201D; with others, even when such behavior may contradict what you believe.</p>
<p>As you might expect, high and low self-monitors are persuaded differently. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_110">White and Gerstein (1987)</xref> conducted a study to investigate how high and low self-monitors might be persuaded to offer help to people with disabilities. Because they knew that high self-monitors want to &#x201C;look good,&#x201D; these researchers suspected that high self-monitors could be persuaded to help if they thought a social reward would result. To test this, high and low self-monitors heard lectures about Kitty Genovese, a woman who was murdered in New York City while many people watched but did not help. In one version of the lecture, subjects learned that people who help receive social rewards. In another version, subjects were told that helping others usually does not result in social rewards. Later, the subjects were phoned and asked to volunteer to help people who were visually impaired. Of those who&#x2019;d been told that helping results in social rewards, 80 percent of the high self-monitors volunteered, but only 48 percent of the low self-monitors did. When subjects did not expect social rewards, 68 percent of the low self-monitors volunteered, and only 40 percent of the high self-monitors did. In other words, high self-monitors are influenced by situations that yield social benefits or enhance their images. Low self-monitors are more internally motivated and less susceptible to external rewards.</p>
<p>Similarly, several studies in advertising suggest that high self-monitors are more influenced by &#x201C;image-based&#x201D; advertising. In contrast, low self-monitors are more interested in &#x201C;product-quality&#x201D; advertising. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_104">Snyder and DeBono (1989)</xref> found that high self-monitors were willing to pay more money for a product that promised to improve their image (e.g., an ad shows a bottle of Canadian Club resting on a set of house blueprints and reads, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re not just moving in, you&#x2019;re moving up&#x201D;), whereas low self-monitors would pay more for a product that suggests high quality (e.g., an ad for Canadian Club that reads, &#x201C;When it comes to great taste, everyone draws the same conclusion&#x201D;). Moreover, high self-monitors reported liking <target target-type="page" id="page_115">115</target>cheese more when they believed it was from France (an image-enhancing country) than from Kansas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_21">DeBono &#x0026; Rubin, 1995</xref>), liking perfume more when it was in an attractive rather than an unattractive bottle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_22">DeBono, Leavitt, &#x0026; Backus, 2003</xref>), preferring an energy drink when it was labeled &#x201C;Fast Track&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;Energy Drink Enhancer&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_100">Smidt &#x0026; DeBono, 2011</xref>), and preferring champagne that was endorsed by four people rather than one person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_71">Myers &#x0026; Sar, 2013</xref>). In contrast, low self-monitors based their judgments on the actual taste of the cheese and smell of the perfume, and preferred the label &#x201C;Energy Drink Enhancer.&#x201D; Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_29">Evans and Clark (2012)</xref> found that low self-monitors were more confident in their thoughts about a persuasive appeal when the source of the appeal was described as being an expert (e.g., a doctor and researcher), while high self-monitors were more confident when the source was described as having an attractive image (e.g., an honor student, active in student government).</p>

<p>According to the theory, on any topic, whether it be abortion, an advertised product, or a favorite movie, there are a range of possible opinions that a person can hold. For example, one topic is what should be done with people who have been found guilty of first-degree murder. Here are several positions, some extreme, some moderate, which you might embrace on this topic. Murderers should:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><target target-type="page" id="page_116">116</target>Be pardoned if they have performed other good deeds during their lives.</p></list-item>

<title>Persuasion by Degrees</title>
<p><italic>Social judgment theory</italic> argues that on this continuum of positions, we each have a most preferred position, called an <italic>anchor.</italic> For instance, imagine that two people, Muffy and Mort, both agree most with position 6, that murderers should spend their lives in prison with no chance for parole. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5_2">Figure 5.2</xref>, this anchor point is represented by an &#x201C;X.&#x201D; Of course, the anchor position is not the only position a person might find acceptable. You can see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5_2">Figure 5.2</xref>, for example, that Muffy also would accept the death penalty as a fitting punishment. Together, with Muffy&#x2019;s anchor, these positions represent Muffy&#x2019;s <italic>latitude of acceptance.</italic> In other words, these are positions she finds tolerable. She would not, however, agree with all positions, for in addition to the latitude of acceptance, social judgment theory describes two other latitudes. The first, called the <italic>latitude of noncommitment,</italic> contains positions about <target target-type="page" id="page_117">117</target>which a person feels neutral or ambivalent. Muffy is neither for nor against murderers receiving life sentences with the possibility of parole; she is neutral. The second, called the <italic>latitude of rejection,</italic> contains positions that a person would reject. For example, Muffy rejects the idea that murderers be pardoned for good deeds, be allowed to pay blood money, spend 5 to 20 years in prison, or be tortured to death.</p>

<title>Changes in Attitude, Changes in Latitude</title>
<p>Notice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5_2">Figure 5.2</xref> that the span of these latitudes is different for different people. Compared to Mort, Muffy has a larger latitude of rejection and narrower latitudes of noncommitment and acceptance. For this reason, Muffy is a good example of an ego-involved person. People are ego involved when an issue has personal significance to them and their sense of self. Thus, they become strongly committed to their stand on the issue and are more likely to reject other positions. A person might also be ego involved about one issue and not another. For instance, Muffy might have strong feelings about what happens to murderers, but care less about abortion, gun control, or gasoline prices.</p>

<title>Assimilation&#x2013;Contrast Phenomenon: The Great Divide</title>
<p>Social judgment theory makes several important predictions about the process of persuasion. First, because people judge everything according to their anchor position, it is difficult, if not impossible, to persuade them to accept a position too far away from that anchor. For instance, if you tried to convince Mort that murderers should be pardoned for performing good deeds, you&#x2019;d be wasting your time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5_2">Figure 5.2</xref>); messages falling inside a person&#x2019;s latitude of rejection are bound to fail. In fact, the theory argues that when a message falls too far away from a person&#x2019;s anchor position, the person perceives the message to be farther away from the anchor than it really is. This is known as the <italic>contrast effect.</italic> However, the <italic>assimilation effect</italic> occurs when a message that falls within a person&#x2019;s latitude of acceptance is perceived to be closer to the anchor position than it really is. For example, although Mort would prefer that murderers be severely punished, if you told Mort that murderers should be moderately punished, he might decide that you basically agree and accept your position. Thus, whereas contrast leads to the rejection of a message, assimilation leads to successful persuasion.</p>
<p>You might have guessed by now that the contrast effect is more likely in ego-involved people than in people who are not ego involved. Indeed, it&#x2019;s difficult to persuade someone who is ego involved (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_98">Sherif, Kelly, Rodgers, Sarup, &#x0026; Tittler, 1973</xref>). Because their latitude of rejection is so large (and their latitude of acceptance is so narrow), obviously, they will reject most persuasive messages.</p>

<title>Baby Steps: Nudging Someone Along</title>
<p>One of the things we like best about <italic>social judgment theory</italic> is how it suggests that persuasion is not a &#x201C;one-shot deal.&#x201D; We think the theory does a good job of illustrating that persuasion may have to occur over time. For example, imagine trying to persuade Muffy that murderers should merely be pardoned for good deeds (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5_2">Figure 5.2</xref>). We&#x2019;ve already seen that trying to convince her of that will lead to rejection. But aiming messages nearer the anchor point might meet with more success. You might try to persuade Muffy that life in prison with a chance for parole is a good <target target-type="page" id="page_118">118</target>position. Then, if she agrees to that, later you could try to convince her that 20 years in prison is justified; some murderers do repent and reform. Get the idea? Anchor positions need to be moved gradually.</p>

<title>Issue Involvement: What&#x2019;s This Have to Do With Me?</title>
<p>Although we just stated that involvement inhibits persuasion, in reality, things are more complicated than that. Indeed, the effect of involvement on persuasion depends on the type of involvement we&#x2019;re considering. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_45">Johnson and Eagly (1990)</xref> argued that two types of involvement are ego involvement (a.k.a. v<italic>alue-relevant involvement</italic>), which is linked to enduring values embedded in a person&#x2019;s self-concept, and <italic>outcome-relevant involvement</italic> (a.k.a. <italic>issue involvement</italic>), which has to do with a person&#x2019;s current goals or outcomes (e.g., a cancer patient with the goal of using marijuana to minimize physical pain). Based on this notion, Johnson and Eagly analyzed a large number of studies and found that, consistent with social judgment theory, value-relevant involvement inhibited persuasion. Meanwhile, consistent with the <italic>elaboration likelihood model</italic> (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter2">Chapter 2</xref>), issue involvement caused people to pay closer attention to arguments in persuasive messages. Issue involvement facilitated persuasion when arguments were strong but inhibited persuasion when arguments were weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_45">Johnson &#x0026; Eagly, 1990</xref>). Another study found that when listening to messages promoting health, involved people were more persuaded by informational messages, while noninvolved people were more persuaded by testimonials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_10">Braverman, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Dogmatism, Authoritarianism, and Social Vigilantism: You Can&#x2019;t Teach an Old Dog New Tricks</title>
<p>In the classic movie <italic>A Few Good Men,</italic> Tom Cruise and Demi Moore defend two Marines, who, while following orders from their superior officers, accidentally killed a fellow soldier. Their defense? &#x201C;We were simply following orders.&#x201D;</p>
<p>History is replete with examples of this excuse. It was used by Nazi defendants at Nuremberg. It was repeated again during the Vietnam War by soldiers involved in the My Lai massacre, by Ollie North in the Iran-Contragate scandal, and by U.S. soldiers in charge of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib. &#x201C;We were following orders&#x201D; is a timeworn excuse and a reflection of a personality trait known as <italic>authoritarianism</italic>.</p>
<p>Authoritarian people respect authoritative leadership and tend to follow authorities blindly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_1">Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levenson, &#x0026; Sanford, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_3">Allport, 1954</xref>). They condemn those who question and deviate from conventional norms, exhibit hostility toward out-group members, and help cause and inflame intergroup conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_4">Altemeyer, 1999</xref>). They are less forgiving and more vengeful toward unrepentant transgressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_48">Khoury, Struthers, Santelli, &#x0026; Marjanovic, 2012</xref>), and they raise children who are unaccepting of out-groups and who tend to associate with bullies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_50">Knafo, 2003</xref>). They believe that power and rigid control are acceptable, and are likely to use physical punishment. Finally, if you are authoritarian, you may not have the self-insight to recognize it. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_4">Altemeyer (1999)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>If you tell people about authoritarianism, including the part about authoritarians being aggressive when backed by authority, and then ask them how willing they would be to help the federal government eliminate <target target-type="page" id="page_119">119</target>authoritarians, then&#x2014;you guessed it&#x2014;High [authoritarians] will be more willing to volunteer than others, to hunt themselves down. &#x2026; And yet, compared with most people, they think their minds are models of rationality and self-understanding.</p>
<attrib>(p. 159)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A personality trait that is very much related to authoritarianism is <italic>dogmatism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_87">Rokeach, 1960</xref>). In fact, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_16">Christie (1991)</xref>, dogmatism was introduced as a more general type of authoritarianism; although some argue that authoritarianism and dogmatism scales measure the same thing, others claim that the authoritarianism scale tends to identify closed-minded conservatives, whereas the dogmatism scale identifies closed-minded liberals and conservatives. Whatever the case, dogmatic people, like authoritarians, tend to be deferential to authorities. In addition, dogmatics are closed-minded, have difficulty being objective, and tend to believe there is only one right way to do things (i.e., their way).</p>
<p>With this in mind, you might think that such closed-mindedness makes authoritarian and dogmatic people difficult to persuade. Interestingly, however, a meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_82">Preiss and Gayle (1999)</xref> found just the opposite&#x2014;that is, compared to their counterparts, dogmatic and authoritarian people were <italic>easier</italic> to persuade. The authors suggested that the rigid beliefs of people with such traits might interfere with the way they scrutinize messages, thereby resulting in greater agreement with a message.</p>
<p>Note, however, that although Preiss and Gayle&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_82">1999</xref>) analysis is useful in some respects, we think it&#x2019;s too soon to conclude that dogmatic and authoritarian people are easy to persuade. Indeed, we suggest that more research needs to be conducted to determine <italic>when</italic> dogmatism/authoritarianism is positively related to persuasion and when it is not. By way of example, successfully persuading such people might depend on the nature of the source. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_37">Harvey and Beverly (1961)</xref>, for instance, reported that high authoritarians, compared to low authoritarians, are more likely to be influenced by a person who is a high-status authority. Similarly, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_20">DeBono and Klein (1993)</xref> found that when dogmatic people received persuasive messages from experts, they did not think much about the messages and, regardless of the quality of the messages, were more persuaded than people who were not dogmatic. However, when they received persuasive messages from nonexperts, dogmatics were more persuaded by strong arguments than by weak ones. Thus, it may be that authoritarians and &#x201C;high dogs,&#x201D; as people who are highly dogmatic are called by researchers, are especially vulnerable to messages from authority figures.</p>
<p>A related trait is known as <italic>social vigilantism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_89">Saucier &#x0026; Webster, 2010</xref>). Like dogmatics, social vigilantes think their beliefs are superior to others&#x2019; beliefs. Unlike dogmatics, who tend to dismiss those who disagree with them, social vigilantes try to impress their beliefs onto others. By way of example, when confronted with a contrary view, a social vigilante in one study stated, &#x201C;Everyone does have a right to their own opinions. I just think you should know how ignorant you sound when you voice them&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_89">Saucier &#x0026; Webster, 2010</xref>, p. 19). Not surprisingly, research indicates that social vigilantes, compared to people measuring low on this trait, not only express more belief superiority, they also counterargue more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_89">Saucier &#x0026; Webster, 2010</xref>), <target target-type="page" id="page_120">120</target>and attempt to dominate conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_61">Maki &#x0026; Raimi, 2017</xref>). Finally, when trying to resist the persuasive attempts of others, social vigilantes use a variety of tactics, including getting emotionally upset and belittling their conversational partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_90">Saucier, Webster, Hoffman, &#x0026; Strain, 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Narcissism: How Do I Love Me? Let Me Count the Ways</title>
<p>In Greek mythology, Narcissus, who scorned those who loved him, saw his reflection in a pool of water and fell in love with himself. Not only that, he got a personality trait named after him. According to a review by Kausel and his colleagues (2016), narcissists have grandiose views of themselves, a lack of concern for others, and use a wide range of persuasive strategies to increase their self-concept and public image. What&#x2019;s more, narcissists are persuaded by messages that fuel their conceit. One study, for example, found that narcissists, compared to non-narcissists, were more likely to purchase high- versus low-distinctive merchandise (e.g., a &#x201C;limited-edition&#x201D; iPod case with personal name engraving rather than a &#x0024;50 gift card) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_54">Lee, Gregg, &#x0026; Park, 2013</xref>). Another found that narcissists were fond of &#x201C;virtual mirror,&#x201D; a popular application that allows consumers to experience products virtually. Specifically, narcissists, compared to non-narcissists, were more inclined to purchase clothing when their own images, rather than the images of professional models, were overlaid with the clothing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_5">Baek, Yoo, &#x0026; Yoon, 2016</xref>). Finally, when it comes to persuading potential sexual partners, narcissists are more likely to employ coercive tactics, including physical force, the use of alcohol, and manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_9">Blinkhorn, Lyons, &#x0026; Almond, 2015</xref>). Given that, it&#x2019;s hard to see what they see in themselves.</p>

<title>Cognitive Complexity and Need for Cognition</title>
<p>How would you describe your best friend? Fun or boring? Intelligent or stupid? Superficial or disclosive? Even-tempered or moody?</p>
<p>According to a theory known as <italic>constructivism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_24">Delia, O&#x2019;Keefe, &#x0026; O&#x2019;Keefe, 1982</xref>), people attempt to make sense of their world by using constructs like the ones just mentioned. <italic>Constructs</italic> are perceptual categories (e.g., fat/thin, popular/unpopular, strong/weak) that we use when evaluating everything from professors, to textbooks, to music, to arguments. Constructs can be compared to eyeglasses: Just as the size, shape, and color of lenses affect the way you see things, the constructs you use to filter messages influence the way in which you perceive the world. For instance, someone who evaluates you on the sole basis of whether you are Christian or non-Christian will see you much differently than someone who uses more constructs (such as kind or cruel, shy or extroverted, happy or sad, playful or serious, emotional or stoic) to evaluate you. Obviously, everyone has a unique system of constructs, and some people clearly use more constructs than others. People who use a large number of different and abstract constructs that are well integrated are known as <italic>cognitively complex,</italic> whereas those who use fewer and less abstract constructs are <italic>cognitively simple.</italic></p>
<p>People who are more cognitively complex, compared to those who are not, are better at seeing the world from their listeners&#x2019; perspective. As a general rule, they are better at adapting their messages to their listeners and are much more persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_108">Waldron &#x0026; Applegate, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_121">121</target>When it comes to <italic>being</italic> persuaded, cognitively complex people may also differ from those who are cognitively simple. For instance, cognitively complex people may be more willing than people low in cognitive complexity to tolerate messages that are inconsistent with their cognitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_66">McGill, Johnson, &#x0026; Bantel, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to being different in the degree to which they are cognitively complex, research shows that people differ in their <italic>need for cognition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_13">Cacioppo &#x0026; Petty, 1982</xref>). People who are high in the need for cognition enjoy effortful thinking more than those low in the need. We also bet they like playing chess and torturing themselves with logic puzzles. According to some researchers, need for cognition is one facet of cognitive complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_66">McGill et al., 1994</xref>). Whatever the case, compared to people who are low in the need for cognition, those high in the need for cognition are more tolerant of disagreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_58">Linvill, Mazer, &#x0026; Boatwright, 2016</xref>) and are viewed by discussion partners as more effective persuaders who generate more valid arguments for their views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_99">Shestowsky &#x0026; Horowitz, 2004</xref>). Perhaps that is why research indicates that people who are high in the need for cognition are more effective salespeople than those who are low in the need for cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_105">Sojka &#x0026; Deeter-Schmelz, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Research also shows that people high in the need for cognition are persuaded differently than their brain-relaxing counterparts. Although people high in the need for cognition pay close attention to messages, evaluating and scrutinizing all the time, people low in the need for cognition are less motivated to attend to messages and are persuaded by peripheral cues instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_13">Cacioppo &#x0026; Petty, 1982</xref>). Thus, if you&#x2019;re high in the need for cognition, you are persuaded by quality arguments. If you&#x2019;re low in the need for cognition, you may be persuaded by an attractive speaker (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_80">Perlini &#x0026; Hansen, 2001</xref>), a likable source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_84">Reinhard &#x0026; Messner, 2009</xref>), a celebrity spokesperson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_111">Williams-Piehota, Schneider, Pizarro, Mowad, &#x0026; Salovey, 2003</xref>), a lot of examples, or a snappy-sounding sales pitch, even if the arguments used are weak. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_46">Kaufman, Stasson, and Hart (1999)</xref> found that when reading an article on evolution theory, the evaluations of people high in the need for cognition were not affected by the source of the article. In contrast, people low in the need for cognition rated the article favorably, but only if they thought it came from the <italic>Washington Post</italic> (a highly credible source). If they thought the article was from the <italic>National Enquirer,</italic> they did not rate it favorably. At least one implication is clear: If the ghost of Elvis Presley <italic>really</italic> wants a following, it should seek coverage in a more reputable publication.</p>

<title>Persuasion and Aggression: Sticks and Stones</title>
<p>Persuasion is not always pretty. Spouse abuse is rampant. Parents beating children as a way to get them to behave is all too common. And who hasn&#x2019;t been called &#x201C;chicken,&#x201D; &#x201C;wimp,&#x201D; &#x201C;bitch,&#x201D; or &#x201C;brat&#x201D; by someone wanting to see a change in behavior? Clearly, aggression is the dark side of persuasion. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_41">Dominic Infante (1987)</xref> argues that aggression is not always bad; aggressive acts can be either constructive or destructive (or both), depending on the type of aggression and how it affects a relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_41">Infante, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_83">Rancer, 2004</xref>). According to Infante, there are several forms of aggressive communication. We discuss two of them here.</p>
<p>First, <italic>verbal aggressiveness,</italic> a destructive form of aggression, involves the tendency to attack someone by using threats, profanity, insults, and teasing, and by insulting <target target-type="page" id="page_122">122</target>their character, competence, background, appearance, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_83">Rancer, 2004</xref>). In short, verbal aggression is aimed at damaging another person&#x2019;s self-concept. As might be expected, compared to nonviolent marriages, violent ones are characterized by higher verbal aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_43">Infante, Chandler, &#x0026; Rudd, 1989</xref>). In other contexts, verbally aggressive teachers are perceived as less credible than their counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_64">Mazer &#x0026; Stowe, 2016</xref>), and verbally aggressive supervisors have less satisfied and committed employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_60">Madlock &#x0026; Dillow, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, <italic>argumentativeness,</italic> a constructive form of assertiveness, involves the tendency to defend and refute positions on controversial issues. Argumentative people approach arguments while nonargumentative people avoid them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_83">Rancer, 2004</xref>). Although we sometimes have negative connotations about the word &#x201C;argument,&#x201D; research shows that argumentativeness is associated with employee satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_42">Infante &#x0026; Gordon, 1991</xref>) and success in college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_40">Infante, 1982</xref>). Moreover, while students perceive verbally aggressive instructors as having low credibility, they perceive argumentative instructors as having high credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_28">Edwards &#x0026; Myers, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To us, perhaps the most interesting line of research on traits and influence examines the ways in which people &#x201C;edit&#x201D; their persuasive messages before they present them. Perhaps you&#x2019;ve caught yourself doing this&#x2014;you want to use a particular strategy, but something keeps you from doing it. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_35">Hample and Dallinger (1987)</xref> explored the reasons people keep themselves from using certain influence strategies and found that verbal aggressiveness is associated with these reasons. For example, compared to verbally aggressive people, those who are not verbally aggressive tend to suppress arguments because the arguments violate their principles (e.g., threats may be seen as unethical) or for person-centered reasons (e.g., using certain strategies may harm a person&#x2019;s image or a personal relationship). (For more detail on this topic, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_34">Hample, 2016</xref>.)</p>
<p>Finally, although we&#x2019;ve painted a rather grim picture of verbal aggression, some of our own work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_93">Seiter &#x0026; Gass, 2010</xref>) argues that such aggression may be acceptable in certain situations. Take political contests as an example. Unlike many people we&#x2019;ve heard grumbling about how negative and nasty political campaigns have become, we welcome political attacks. Don&#x2019;t get us wrong; we are not condoning all comments. Foes who labeled John Quincy Adams a tyrant and pimp, and Abraham Lincoln an ape and butcher were clearly out of line. On the other hand, we do not mind attacks, even those aimed at a politician&#x2019;s character, as long as the attacks are truthful, relevant, and appropriate. Voters should have the information they need to make tough choices, even if that information comes at a cost to potentially ineffective or unethical folks who are running for public office.</p>

<title>Analyzing and Adapting to Audiences</title>
<p>To us, the most entertaining part of Super Bowl Sunday is its television advertisements. This, of course, is not surprising when you consider that businesses spend billions of dollars every year analyzing their audiences, trying to determine what will pique interests and sell products. Despite the big bucks, however, when attempting to market products to different cultural groups, businesses have made some pretty big blunders: Here are some classic examples:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><target target-type="page" id="page_123">123</target>The Swedish furniture company Ikea agreed on the name &#x201C;Fartfull&#x201D; for one of its desks (Cross cultural marketing blunders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_19">2012</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When Kentucky Fried Chicken opened in China, its famous slogan &#x201C;Finger lickin&#x2019; good&#x201D; was mistranslated into Chinese characters that meant &#x201C;eat your fingers off&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_11">Brooks, 2013</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Imagine how those in the auto industry felt when they learned that, in Spanish, Nova means &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t go&#x201D;; in Portuguese, Pinto is slang for &#x201C;a small male organ&#x201D;; and Esso, pronounced phonetically in Japanese, means &#x201C;stalled car&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_18">Copeland &#x0026; Griggs, 1985</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>But wait! Corporations can still goof up, even when cultural differences are not involved. Take Target, for example. The mammoth discount store ran into trouble when a customer noticed that the same dress was listed as &#x201C;Manatee Gray&#x201D; in plus-sizes and &#x201C;Dark Heather Gray&#x201D; in regular sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_52">Krupnick, 2013</xref>). Whoops!</p>
<p>The lesson here is simple: If you want to be influential, know whom you are talking to and adapt accordingly. Remember what we said earlier about cognitively complex people? Research shows that such people are more persuasive because they are able to see the world from other people&#x2019;s points of view. As a result, they tend to use person-centered influence tactics (i.e., tactics tailored specifically to the person they are trying to persuade; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_108">Waldron &#x0026; Applegate, 1998</xref>). This, to us, seems to be what persuasion is all about: adapting a message so it coincides with the receiver&#x2019;s frame of reference. To be sure, a persuader doesn&#x2019;t move the receiver to the message, the persuader moves the message to the receiver. It&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s called being &#x201C;market-driven&#x201D; in business, &#x201C;audience-centered&#x201D; in public speaking, and &#x201C;listener-oriented&#x201D; in interpersonal communication. It may also be the most important lesson you can <target target-type="page" id="page_124">124</target>learn about how to be a successful persuader. To influence other people, you should know as much as possible about them so you can appeal to their needs and wants, while at the same time avoid offending them. Of course, attempting to be too diplomatic can go too far. For example, we once heard a story of some people who asked a politician where he stood on a particular issue. So as not to alienate anyone, the politician replied, &#x201C;Some of my friends are for it, some of my friends are against it, and I&#x2019;m for my friends.&#x201D; If we&#x2019;d been in the audience, we would not have been impressed. Thus, it&#x2019;s important to adapt to an audience without coming across as insincere, &#x201C;smooth,&#x201D; or deceptive.</p>

<p>Entire books have been written on audience analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_68">McQuail, 1997</xref>), and we cannot give full treatment to the topic here. However, to help you understand the types of issues involved, we discuss segmentation analysis, a special type of audience analysis, in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box5_2">Box 5.2</xref>. In addition, we list a few guidelines that might be useful if you&#x2019;re ever faced with an audience that needs to be analyzed.</p>
<sec id="sec5_3_1">
<title>Pay Attention to the Situation</title>
<p>Remember what we discussed earlier in the chapter: Communicator characteristics <italic>and</italic> situations affect how audiences respond to persuasive messages. Knowing details about some aspects of a situation can be useful when preparing to persuade someone. For instance, will you be talking to one person or to a large audience? Will the setting be noisy, hot, colorful? Will the persuasion occur in the morning or evening? Will you be inside or out, in a church, or on a football field? Might there be hecklers? Are you expected to talk for five minutes, or can you blab for hours?</p>
<p>Obviously, the number of possible situations is endless. Even so, knowing something about the situation can help you adapt. It&#x2019;s important to try to put yourself in the shoes of your audience. Try to figure out what would appeal to you if you were in their situation and then adapt your message accordingly. Of course, remember to be an ethical persuader. In our opinion, analyzing the situation can help you do this. We&#x2019;ll have more to say about this topic in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter16">Chapter 16</xref>.</p>

<caption><title>Bull&#x2019;s-Eye! An Examination of Targeted Micromarketing</title></caption>
<p>When you consider the billions of dollars that advertisers spend each year, it shouldn&#x2019;t surprise you to find out how much time they devote to learning &#x201C;things&#x201D; about their audience. But we have to admit&#x2014; we were surprised, even scared a little, by some of the things these folks know, or at least claim to know. Did you realize, for example, that based on your zip code, market researchers claim to know what you eat for breakfast, what kind of car you drive, what you watch on television, and a whole lot more? They base these predictions on research showing that people who have the same zip codes tend to be remarkably similar. Not only that, based on your zip code, marketers have dubbed you with funny-sounding nicknames like &#x201C;Blue-Blood Estates,&#x201D; &#x201C;Money and Brains,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Single City Blues.&#x201D; So, for example, if your zip code is 94117 or 15232, you are a &#x201C;Bohemian Mix,&#x201D; you&#x2019;re probably 18 to 34 years old, you enjoy liberal politics and classical records, read <italic>The New Yorker,</italic> and eat frozen waffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_6">Berger, 2004</xref>). See? Spooky!</p>
<p>Using zip codes to categorize consumers is just one example of what is known as micromarketing or market segmentation, which involves &#x201C;breaking a market down to definable, manageable segments <target target-type="page" id="page_125">125</target>and then tailoring your efforts to just one or two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_75">Ogden, 2000</xref>, p. 29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_91">Schewe &#x0026; Meredith, 2004</xref>). It sounds complicated, but nowadays, it&#x2019;s necessary. Clearly, advertising, campaigning, and marketing are not as easy as they used to be. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_79">Penn (2007)</xref> argued that a once-universal audience has fragmented into hundreds of small groups or niches. Examples include &#x201C;Tech Fatales&#x201D; (women prone to buying technological equipment), &#x201C;30 Winkers&#x201D; (people getting less than seven hours of sleep a night), and &#x201C;Late-Breaking Gays&#x201D; (gay people who have come out of the closet later in life due to more social acceptance of homosexuality). These small groups, if understood correctly, can be adapted and appealed to, thus starting &#x201C;microtrends&#x201D; that can affect business and society in profound ways.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#x2019;s not only zip codes that help marketers segment audiences. They have a large list of ways to categorize their consumers. Knowing your age, for instance, may help them design ads that appeal to you. But wait&#x2014;it gets more complicated. For example, it is not enough to know that your main audience is composed of children. One marketing firm has argued that there are &#x201C;six species of kids,&#x201D; each requiring a different approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_32">Gertner, 2004</xref>, p. 102). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_81">Debra Phillips (1999)</xref>, it may sound funny, but there&#x2019;s a big difference between being 10 years old and being 14, and advertisements aimed at teens are different than those aimed at &#x201C;the legions of 9- to 12-year-olds whimsically referred to as &#x2018;&#x2019;tweens&#x2019;&#x201D;(p. 126). Whereas &#x2019;tweens may scoff at the likes of Mickey Mouse and his pals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_81">Phillips, 1999</xref>), younger children are still attracted to such characters.</p>
<p>If your head isn&#x2019;t spinning yet, just wait. We all know, for instance, that kids like candy, but different groups of kids (and adults) may have different tastes. If you&#x2019;re a marketer, here&#x2019;s when knowing the ethnicity of your target audience can come in handy. For example, market research suggests that while African Americans enjoy very sweet, hard candies in nonchocolate flavors like mint and coconut, Hispanic Americans like &#x201C;aggressive&#x201D; flavors like lollipops coated with chili powder and mixed with tamarind. Asian Americans, on the other hand, like the texture of chocolate (&#x201C;Serving ethnic markets,&#x201D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_95">1999</xref>). When you consider this, along with the fact that African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans make up a large portion of the U.S. population, it is clear why marketers are targeting these groups with all sorts of appeals, including ethnic &#x201C;aisles&#x201D; in grocery stores and packaging that attracts certain ethnic groups (e.g., for many Asian Americans, candy packaged in tins connotes quality) (&#x201C;Serving ethnic markets,&#x201D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_95">1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, by now, we&#x2019;re sure you see that the number of ways that marketers can segment consumers is almost limitless. Indeed, in addition to using age, zip codes, and ethnicity, marketers design messages on the basis of gender, education, economic status, and career choice, just to name a few. As time goes by, consumer markets only promise to get smaller. This is especially true on the Internet, which, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_8">Bianco, Lowry, Berner, Arndt, and Grover (2004)</xref>, is an interactive medium that enables marketers to personalize messages and products for each consumer. One of the authors, for example, is a member of Netflix, a company that lets you order movies online. After viewing a movie, you can rate it and, based on your ratings, the company provides you with personalized recommendations for other movies you might like. If you have ever purchased a product from Amazon.com, you might have noticed the same feature: Every time you make a purchase, you may be giving information that can be used to persuade you in the future. In fact, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_57">Lindstrom (2011)</xref>, when you search Google, use Facebook, swipe your credit card, or download an iTunes song, data-mining companies are analyzing it and then selling your data to marketers. Even using those innocent-looking online coupons can help marketers target you. Specifically, those coupon&#x2019;s bar codes are encoded with information about you, which can be used by marketers later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_57">Lindstrom, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_126">126</target>Keep Your Audience&#x2019;s Mind in Mind</title>
<p>In the old movie <italic>What Women Want,</italic> Mel Gibson played a male chauvinist advertiser who, after a freak accident, was able to read women&#x2019;s minds. Not surprisingly, Mel not only became an expert at attracting the opposite sex but could also design advertisements that women couldn&#x2019;t resist. The movie illustrates how much easier persuasion might be if you had ESP. Indeed, if you could look into people&#x2019;s minds and know their attitudes, values, and needs, we imagine that adapting your persuasive messages would be a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Although we can&#x2019;t teach you to be psychic, we can give you a few tips about &#x201C;reading&#x201D; people&#x2019;s attitudes, values, and needs. First, as you already know from <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter3">Chapter 3</xref>, there are a number of ways to measure or make guesses about people&#x2019;s attitudes (e.g., using scales, simply asking them, and so on). Once you know a person&#x2019;s attitudes, it is easier to show him or her how that attitude may be inconsistent with other attitudes, shifted to be stronger, and so forth.</p>
<p>Second, it may be possible to make guesses about a person&#x2019;s values based on other information. For example, values are often culturally determined. By learning the values of a culture, there&#x2019;s a reasonable chance you&#x2019;ve learned the values held by an individual within the culture. For instance, earlier in this chapter, we saw that people from the United States tend to value individuals over collectives and that people from China tend toward the opposite. With that in mind, persuasive messages that highlight and promote these values in their respective cultures should be more influential than those that do not. Remember, though, that stereotypes are not always accurate. Keep in mind that cultural values serve as guidelines for developing persuasive messages. Even so, such messages might backfire on some individuals.</p>
<p>Finally, though different individuals&#x2019; needs may vary drastically, some needs may be universal. Knowing about such needs could prove useful for designing persuasive messages. For example, do you think people who design and advertise smoke alarms know about basic security needs? You bet they do! If you&#x2019;ve ever seen one of those advertisements with a family standing at the curb in their pajamas while their house burns down in the background, you know what we&#x2019;re talking about. Advertisers know how to appeal to people&#x2019;s needs.</p>
<p>To help you get a better handle on the types of needs that may be used to motivate people, consider the now-classic typology presented by the humanistic psychologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_62">Abraham Maslow (1970)</xref>. According to Maslow, human needs are hierarchical, with the most basic biological needs at the lowest level of the hierarchy and more complex needs at the top. Specifically, Maslow argued that human needs were arranged in the following order, from most basic to most complex: physiological (e.g., the need for food and water), safety (e.g., the need for stability and security), belonging (e.g., the need for acceptance and love), esteem (e.g., the need to feel important and unique), and self-actualization (e.g., the need to grow, create, and understand). According to Maslow, before people are motivated to satisfy higher-level needs, their lower-level needs must be met. Thus, a person who is starving to death will be more interested in obtaining food than in boosting his or her self-esteem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5_3_3">
<title>Remember the Importance of Audience States and Traits</title>
<p>You know by now that communicator traits and states play a large role in persuasion. It&#x2019;s something to keep in mind if you&#x2019;re ever confronted by someone with traits or in <target target-type="page" id="page_127">127</target>the states we&#x2019;ve discussed. For example, we noted that anxious people require specific recommendations and reassurances when using fear appeals and that high self-monitors respond well to messages that promise to help them &#x201C;fit in.&#x201D; Previous research suggests that tailoring your appeals to the particular traits of your audience will make you more successful in your persuasive endeavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_38">Hirsch, Kang, &#x0026; Bodenhausen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5_51">Kraichy &#x0026; Chapman, 2014</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5_3_4">
<title>Don&#x2019;t Forget About Audience Demographics</title>
<p>A person who can adapt to people of different ages, genders, cultures, and so forth obviously will be more successful than a person who can&#x2019;t. For example, when speaking to small children, using lots of statistics would probably lead to lots of &#x201C;ants in the pants.&#x201D; By the same token, a group of senior citizens would probably squirm or snooze if forced to listen to a speech about planning for pregnancy. Moreover, although we noted that there do not appear to be gender differences in persuadability, it doesn&#x2019;t mean a speaker can ignore the gender of her audience. Notice, for example, by using the word <italic>her</italic> in the previous sentence, we failed to address males who might be reading this book. In short, we&#x2019;re sure you get the point: Whenever possible, know about your audience&#x2019;s age, gender, socioeconomic status, and so forth. Then adapt.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In this chapter, we discussed several communicator characteristics that affect the process of persuasion. First, we examined demographic variables, noting that some (e.g., age, ethnicity) influence the sending and receiving of persuasive messages, whereas others (e.g., gender) do not appear to be related to influenceability. Second, we showed how several psychological and communication states and traits (i.e., self-esteem, anxiety, preference for consistency, self-monitoring, ego involvement, dogmatism, authoritarianism, social vigilantism, narcissism, cognitive complexity, need for cognition, and aggression) influence persuasive communication. Finally, we examined the notion of audience analysis, indicating that persuaders, when possible, should attempt to adapt to the needs, wants, backgrounds, and so forth of their audiences.</p>

<p>BO, PEEP, SHEEP, AND THE HALE&#x2013;BOPP COMET may sound like the makings of a good fairytale, but, as the saying goes, truth is stranger than fiction, and, unfortunately, the story of Bo and Peep&#x2019;s sheep is a true one. We refer to the people of the Heaven&#x2019;s Gate cult as sheep because who else but sheep would believe what these people were told&#x2014;that they should commit mass suicide so they might shed their bodies and be whisked away by an alien spaceship that was flying around in the tail of the Hale&#x2013;Bopp comet? Whether they believed it or not, they did what their leaders, Bo and Peep, told them to do. In 1997, sheriff&#x2019;s deputies found the corpses of 21 women and 18 men decomposing in a home in Rancho Santa Fe, California. All of the members of the cult had apparently ingested a fatal mixture of phenobarbital, applesauce, pudding, and vodka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_42">Gleick, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As authors who are interested in the process of social influence, we can&#x2019;t help but wonder how and why people like those in the Heaven&#x2019;s Gate cult can be persuaded to such extremes. Clearly, several factors must have contributed to the largest mass <target target-type="page" id="page_135">135</target>suicide in U.S. history. The cult members&#x2014;though reportedly bright and happy&#x2014;must have been highly persuadable. Moreover, the leaders of the cult, Marshall Herff Applewhite and Bonnie Lu Nettles (known as Bo and Peep), were highly charismatic and trusted by their followers. But beyond the characteristics of the cult leaders and members, we believe that a strong group dynamic may have contributed to the suicide. Indeed, although from society&#x2019;s perspective the members of the cult were deviants, there seemed to be pressure within the cult to &#x201C;fit in.&#x201D; For instance, the members of the cult reportedly looked the same, so much so that when the corpses were first discovered, they were believed to be men only. The cult members were described as having androgynous appearances; the women wore cropped hair, and many of the men, including the cult&#x2019;s leader, had been castrated. Finally, the cult members were known to dress the same, wearing what one person described as black pajamas. When the 39 corpses were found, each was dressed in black: black pants, black shirt, and brand-new black Nike shoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_42">Gleick, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>We imagine that, if nothing else, being a member of a cult satisfies a need to belong. Cults often attract new members by providing seemingly loving environments for their new recruits. Along with this, however, comes pressure to fit in. With such pressure, it&#x2019;s easy to see how a cult member might have been sucked into the suicide. When you identify so strongly with people who are carrying out some action, the action not only seems more &#x201C;right,&#x201D; it becomes necessary for you to participate if you want to be part of the group. This is true not only in cults, a topic we revisit later in this chapter, but in other social collectives as well. Families, peer groups, workplaces, even classrooms, exert strong pressure on their members to behave in certain ways. For that reason, this chapter examines the role of groups in the process of social influence. We begin by discussing the topic of conformity.</p>
<sec id="sec6_1">
<title>Conformity as Persuasion: In with the Crowd</title>
<p>During a lecture by a sociology professor, in a classroom that held more than 100 people, an undergraduate student, known by both of your authors, removed his shirt, pants, shoes, and socks. Then, almost naked, he stood in the aisle, waiting to be noticed. The professor, who had been looking down at his notes, did not notice our friend until other people in the classroom began gasping and laughing. When the professor finally did look up, he was stunned. Undaunted, the nearly naked student looked down at himself and asked, &#x201C;Does this count?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Apparently, just before the student disrobed, the professor had been lecturing on the topic of norms and conformity. <italic>Norms</italic> are expectations held by a group of people about what behaviors or opinions are right or wrong, good or bad, acceptable or unacceptable, appropriate or inappropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_3">Andrews, 1996</xref>). Once norms are understood, we feel pressure to conform to them. Of course, the professor had probably explained to our friend and his other students that some norms are explicit. <italic>Explicit norms</italic> are written or spoken openly. For example, road signs indicate how fast you are permitted to drive and game rules may send you to jail without collecting &#x0024;200. Some norms, however, are <italic>implicit</italic> and not so openly stated. For example, we imagine that when you&#x2019;re a guest in someone&#x2019;s home, you don&#x2019;t put your feet on the dinner table even though you&#x2019;ve never read a rule saying you shouldn&#x2019;t. Likewise&#x2014; and this is what the sociology professor told his class&#x2014;because we all conform to <target target-type="page" id="page_136">136</target>social norms, no one would take his or her clothes off in the middle of a classroom lecture. Of course, our friend, who prides himself on being a nonconformist, couldn&#x2019;t resist this challenge. The rest is history, and the professor now has a good story to tell whenever he lectures about norms and conformity.</p>
<sec id="sec6_1_1">
<title>In the Beginning: Early Research on Conformity Effects</title>
<p>Not everyone is like our friend, the student-stripper in the sociology class. As we&#x2019;ve noted, in most cases, people know the norms and try to go along with the crowd. Perhaps the most compelling experiment on the effects of conformity was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_6">Solomon Asch (1956)</xref>. Here&#x2019;s how his experiment worked: Asch gathered several (seven to nine) college students into a classroom and told them that they would be participating in an experiment about visual judgment. The students were asked to look at two large, white cards. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6_1">Figure 6.1</xref>, a single vertical line appeared on the first card, and three vertical lines, each of different length, appeared on the second card. The students&#x2019; task was simple: After observing both cards, they were asked to match lines&#x2014;that is, each student was asked to report out loud, to the rest of the group, which of the three lines on the second card was the same length as the line on the other card. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_7">Asch (1966)</xref>, the experiment began uneventfully but changed rapidly:
<disp-quote>
<p>The subjects announce their answers in the order in which they have been seated in the room, and on the first round every person chooses the same matching line. Then a second set of cards is exposed: Again the group is unanimous. The members appear ready to endure politely another boring experiment. On the third trial there is an unexpected disturbance. One person near the end of the group disagrees with all the others in his selection of the matching line. He looks surprised, indeed incredulous, about the disagreement.</p>

<disp-quote>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_137">137</target>On the following trial he disagrees again, while the others remain unanimous in their choice. The dissenter becomes more and more worried and hesitant as the disagreement continues in succeeding trials; he may pause before announcing his answer and speak in a low voice, or he may smile in an embarrassed way.</p>
<attrib>(p. 320)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<p>What the dissenting student in Asch&#x2019;s study did not know was that all of the other students in the group were planted by Asch and told beforehand to give the wrong answers. In other words, Asch was really interested in what a person would do when he or she was giving correct answers that are contrary to the answers of a near-unanimous group decision. What he found was that conformity was common; under group pressure, 75 percent of the subjects gave the wrong answer in at least one of the trials.</p>
<p>In short, then, Asch&#x2019;s experiment illustrates the tremendous power of groups to exert influence. Even so, not all of Asch&#x2019;s subjects behaved in the same way. For instance, about 25 percent remained fairly independent, rarely conforming to the group&#x2019;s answers. Moreover, about 10 percent of the subjects agreed with the group on almost every trial. Thus, it is probably true that some individuals are more prone to conformity than others. In addition, some situations may produce more conformity than others, a topic we discuss next.</p>

<title>Variables Related to Conformity</title>
<sec id="sec6_1_2_1">
<title>Does Group Size Affect Conformity? The More the Scarier?</title>
<p>On the television show <italic>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</italic> contestants can make a bundle of money if they can answer a series of questions that become progressively more difficult. Of course, if they get stumped, the rules allow them to &#x201C;poll the audience,&#x201D; asking those in the studio for advice on one, and only one, question. With that in mind, if you were a contestant on the show and had the choice of an audience with 5 people or 500 people, which audience would you want? What if your choice were between an audience of 499 and 500 people? Would the extra person make a very big difference and, if not, at what point does adding people to the audience become less relevant?</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_138">138</target>Regardless of whether they watch <italic>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</italic>, for some time researchers have been interested in the role that group size plays in persuasion. Two of many theories that make different predictions about the relationship between group size and persuasion are <italic>social impact theory</italic> (SIT) (Latan&#x00E9;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_67">1981</xref>) and the <italic>social influence model</italic> (SIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_106">Tanford &#x0026; Penrod, 1984</xref>). The first, SIT, argues that the first person you add to a group has the most influence. Each additional member has some impact, but less than the person added before him or her. In contrast, SIM argues that the third and fourth people added to a group have the most impact because no minority is possible with only two people. In other words, it is easier to disagree with one person than it is to disagree with two or three people. After three or four people are added, however, the pressure to conform levels off.</p>
<p>Empirical results and meta-analyses on which is the better of these two perspectives are mixed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_11">Bond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_12">Bond &#x0026; Smith, 1996</xref>): Some studies support one perspective, some the other, and some neither. After reviewing the literature, we suspect that both models have found support because both may be accurate when you consider an additional variable&#x2014;that is, when you are making a decision in a group, you are motivated by two things: You want to be right and you want to be liked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_21">Campbell &#x0026; Fairey, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_32">Deutsch &#x0026; Gerard, 1955</xref>). Specifically, sometimes we conform to a group because the group has <italic>informational influence&#x2014;</italic>that is, we have a desire to be right and we conform to the group because we think the group may be correct. However, sometimes we conform to a group because it has <italic>normative influence.</italic> This means that we conform in order to gain rewards (e.g., be liked) and avoid punishments (e.g., scorn) that are associated with agreement and disagreement.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with group size? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_21">Campbell and Fairey (1989)</xref>, increasing the number of people in a group affects informational and normative processes differently. Specifically, when you want to be right, as in the millionaire example, the first person added has the most impact because each additional person&#x2019;s judgment is more likely to be redundant with others in the group. On the other hand, imagine you are just playing an &#x201C;at home&#x201D; version of <italic>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</italic> with some new neighbors. Your goal is not to win money, but just to fit in, be liked, and make some new friends. In this case, agreeing with the neighbors, especially when the number of them reaches two or three, is more likely, even if you think they are wrong. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_11">Bond (2005)</xref>, normative influence is stronger when people respond in front of the group, while informational influence is stronger when people respond in private. That&#x2019;s not to say that these two forms of influence act independently. One study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_69">Levitan &#x0026; Verhulst, 2016</xref>), for example, found that <italic>both</italic> normative and informational influence can have long-lasting effects on people&#x2019;s political attitudes. (For more about group size and conformity, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box6_1">Box 6.1</xref>.)</p>

<sec id="sec6_1_2_2">
<title>Security in Numbers: The Effect of More Than One Dissenter</title>
<p>Having an ally helps a person resist conforming to a group. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_2">Allen and Levine (1971)</xref> found that a single subject is likely to conform when faced with four other people who disagree, but if one of those four sides with the subject, the subject continues to dissent. Interestingly, this seems to be the case even when the supporting partner&#x2019;s judgments are questionable. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_2">Allen and Levine (1971)</xref> found that when trying to make judgments about visual stimuli, even a supporting partner <target target-type="page" id="page_139">139</target>who seemed visually impaired (e.g., wore thick glasses and seemed to have a hard time seeing) prevented subjects from conforming.</p>

<sec id="sec6_1_2_3">
<title>Emotional Reaction of the Majority: Foaming at the Mouth</title>
<p>Since most people are motivated to fit in, it makes sense that getting angry at them when they disagree should increase their motivation to conform. At least that&#x2019;s what one group of researchers thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_51">Heerdink, van Kleef, Homan, &#x0026; Fischer, 2015</xref>). But they were wrong. Contrary to their hypothesis, when a majority group of members expressed anger, it led to anti-conformity, perhaps because the dissenter wanted to harm the group or restore freedom of choice (reactance). Bottom line? If you&#x2019;re trying to bring someone back into the fold, keep your cool.</p>

<title>Moral Conviction: Wrong Is Wrong?</title>
<p>Imagine this scenario: Enemy soldiers are approaching your neighborhood. You and your neighbors try to hide, but, suddenly, your baby starts crying. The only way to keep from being discovered is to smother your baby. Is it morally wrong to do so?</p>
<p>So far, we&#x2019;ve seen that conformity influences the ways in which people answer factual questions (e.g., which lines are similar lengths?), but what about ethical questions like the one above? To find out, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_66">Kundu and Cummins (2013)</xref> asked research participants to respond, either alone or in groups of confederates, to the &#x201C;smother-baby&#x201D; question and others like it. Results indicated that participants were swayed by the opinions of others. Stated differently, moral judgments are vulnerable to group pressure too.</p>

<caption><title>Majority Rules: How to Influence When You&#x2019;re Alone in a Group</title></caption>
<p>This chapter discusses the ways in which a majority of people can influence a minority. As many minority groups have illustrated throughout history, however, sometimes, the minority can influence the majority. This is especially true when the person in the minority is believed to have experience and expertise in whatever topic the group is discussing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_49">Hart, Stasson, &#x0026; Karau, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Even when the person in the minority is not an expert, however, it may be possible for him or her to influence the majority. According to a review of research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_106">Tanford and Penrod (1984)</xref>, two strategies that a minority member can try are (1) conforming with the group and then deviating and (2) consistently disagreeing with the group. The first tactic involves accumulating what might popularly be known as brownie points. Specifically, by going along with the group on most issues, you are more favorable in the group&#x2019;s eyes when you disagree. As a result, you may convince the group to go along with your point of view. In contrast, the second tactic involves disagreeing with the group consistently and competently. By doing this, whoever holds the minority point of view looks more confident and may get the group&#x2019;s attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_75">Moscovici &#x0026; Faucheux, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_76">Moscovici, Lage, &#x0026; Naffrechoux, 1969</xref>). Of course, these two tactics involve opposite behaviors, so if you&#x2019;re in the minority, don&#x2019;t try both; pick one tactic and stick to it. If you&#x2019;re able to convince even one member of the majority to join you, research suggests that others may follow suit (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_27">Clark, 1999</xref>). Finally, recent research indicates that the majority are more willing to consider minority viewpoints if they expect future interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_97">San Martin, Swaab, Sinaceur, &#x0026; Vasiljevic, 2015</xref>). Considering that, you could always mention the likelihood of future interaction.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_140">140</target>That said, there may be exceptions. Indeed, according to the <italic>morality as motivated resistance hypothesis</italic>, people with stronger moral convictions should be more resistant to majority influence than people with weaker convictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_4">Aramovich, Lytle, &#x0026; Skitka, 2012</xref>). Thus far, research supports this hypothesis. For example, Aramovich and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_4">2012</xref>) found that people with strong (versus weak) convictions against torture were more likely to express opposition to torturing suspected terrorists, even when their groups expressed support for such torture.</p>

<sec id="sec6_1_2_5">
<title>Indoctrination: Intense Initiations and Mindless Membership</title>
<p>The only time one of your authors was formally initiated into a group, his high school&#x2019;s Varsity Club, he had to wear a dress and sing Christmas carols in a shopping mall (and it wasn&#x2019;t even Christmas time). Of course, there are more severe initiations than this. In 2003, for instance, a group of Chicago high school girls viciously hazed some younger girls by kicking, strangling, and pelting them with feces, urine, fish entrails, and blood. The same year, three young football players in Bellmore, New York, were sodomized with broomsticks, golf balls, and pinecones during a hazing incident. And although previous literature indicates that 50 percent or more of college athletes and fraternity and sorority members have been involved in hazing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_108">Waldron, 2015</xref>), students are not the only ones participating. In recent incidents, for example, two U.S. servicemen committed suicide after being repeatedly abused by fellow soldiers, and four Texas firefighters were suspended after binding a rookie with duct tape and dousing him with water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_55">Hosansky, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>As brutal as these rituals sound, some argue that such practices build cohesiveness by encouraging bonding among new recruits and rookies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_55">Hosansky, 2013</xref>). Interestingly enough, this may be true. Research suggests that we value a group more if our indoctrination into the group is severe and intense (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_5">Aronson &#x0026; Mills, 1959</xref>). Not only that, once we value a group, we are likely to conform to it. As the introduction to this chapter illustrated, religious cults provide a frightening example of the high level of compliance that may result from intense levels of indoctrination. Indeed, a disturbing number of cult members have died in mass suicides that were encouraged by their leaders (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box6_2">Box 6.2</xref>).</p>
<p>How do cults lure such people into their trap? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_9">Baron (2000)</xref> noted that indoctrination into cults occurs in four stages. First, in the <italic>softening-up stage,</italic> recruits, often targeted when vulnerable (e.g., following a divorce or death of a loved one), are befriended by a member and invited to meetings. There, recruits are showered with attention and praise from cult members, a technique referred to as &#x201C;love bombing&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_90">Richmond, 2004</xref>). Often, recruits are &#x201C;squired&#x201D; by enthusiastic group members or &#x201C;messianic&#x201D; leaders, deprived of sleep, and then confused. The idea here is to lure, then stress, the recruits. In the second stage, <italic>compliance,</italic> the recruits tentatively experiment with some of the behaviors requested by the cult, which may include changes in diet, sleep, and appearance. Though in this stage recruits may simply be paying lip service to the demands of the cult, by the third stage, <italic>internalization,</italic> the recruits begin to consider some of the demands and beliefs of the cult (e.g., all nonmembers are evil) to be more acceptable. Finally, in the <italic>consolidation stage,</italic> recruits become loyal to the cult and demonstrate their allegiance with costly behaviors such as abandoning their careers or academic goals, donating all their personal possessions to the cult, and recruiting new members.</p>

<title>Identification and Conformity: You&#x2019;re My Kind of People</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_19">Kenneth Burke (1950)</xref>, <italic>identification</italic> occurs when people achieve shared meaning. Burke argued that humans are motivated to communicate with one another to create identification. The notion of identification is important here because the more a person identifies with a group, the more power the group has to influence that person.</p>
<p>A group that has the power to influence us through the process of identification is known as a <italic>reference group.</italic> Of course, not all groups are reference groups. For example, you might get together with several other students to study for a test. It&#x2019;s unlikely that such a group would exert much influence on the way you think and behave on a daily basis. However, a group of people you admire and want to be like might have a strong impact on you, often without your even knowing it. Because we identify with reference groups, we tend to dress the way they dress, think the way they think, and act the way they act. With this in mind, it&#x2019;s not surprising that a considerable amount of research indicates that we tend to conform more to a group of people who are similar to us than to a group of people who are not (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_82">Phua, 2013</xref>). Previous research, for example, found that university students were more likely to engage in high-risk sexual activity (i.e., unplanned, inebriated sex) <target target-type="page" id="page_142">142</target>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_54">Holman &#x0026; Sillars, 2012</xref>), and consume more alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_89">Reed, Lange, Ketchie, &#x0026; Clapp, 2007</xref>) when their peers approved of such behavior. Similarly, students and police officers reported being less willing to help a victim of intimate partner violence when they believed their reference group would avoid doing so also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_8">Baldry &#x0026; Pagliaro, 2014</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Although fitting in and getting along can be a good thing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_100">Seiter (1998)</xref> argued that too much identification can have negative consequences in a variety of contexts. For example, in intercultural contexts, <italic>ethnocentrism,</italic> or the belief that one&#x2019;s culture is the standard by which all others should be evaluated, occurs when members of a culture identify too strongly with their own culture. In small group contexts, <italic>groupthink</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_58">Janis, 1972</xref>) occurs when the members in a group are so concerned with achieving consensus and getting along with each other that they don&#x2019;t disagree when they should. In organizational communication contexts, too much identification can lead to what Tompkins and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_16">Bullis &#x0026; Tompkins, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_107">Tompkins &#x0026; Cheney, 1985</xref>) call <italic>strong culture.</italic> Strong cultures exist when employees identify so much with their organization that they conform to the organization&#x2019;s values and actions.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, ethnocentrism, groupthink, and strong culture can result in some seriously negative consequences. For instance, ethnocentrism can lead to hatred, discrimination, and violence toward members of another culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_46">Gudykunst &#x0026; Kim, 1997</xref>). Moreover, groups and organizations characterized by groupthink and strong culture are notorious for bad decision making, because they involve collectives of people who are all thinking in the same way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_101">Sims &#x0026; Sauser, 2013</xref>). Seiter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_99">1995</xref>), for example, showed how a lumber company with a strong culture had difficulty <target target-type="page" id="page_143">143</target>communicating with people outside the organization. That&#x2019;s because inside the company, everyone thought things were rosy, and, as a result, the organization found itself threatened in the face of environmentalist attacks. Clearly, organizations and groups need members who will occasionally &#x201C;rock the boat,&#x201D; &#x201C;blow whistles,&#x201D; and &#x201C;play devil&#x2019;s advocate&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_70">Locke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_88">Redding, 1985</xref>). In fact, although such dissenters can be seen as troublemakers, they can also be admired contributors who promote innovation, creativity, and better decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_60">Jetten &#x0026; Hornsey, 2014</xref>). In short, then, it is apparent that identification, by enabling us to communicate, organize, and decrease division, can be a worthwhile goal. However, we must be moderate in promoting it because too much identification can be &#x201C;too much of a good thing&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_100">Seiter, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Sex Difference</title>
<p>In an analysis of a large number of studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_12">Bond and Smith (1996)</xref> concluded that females are more likely to conform than males. This seems to be the case regardless of when the studies were conducted (i.e., sex differences have not narrowed over time) or whether the participants in the studies were in the presence of the other group members. At least one study suggests that such differences may be due to confidence or lack thereof. Specifically, when performing tasks that favored males, females were less confident and conformed more than did males. For gender-neutral tasks, however, no differences in conformity were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_30">Cross, Brown, Morgan, &#x0026; Laland, 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Peer-suasion</title>
<p>The pressure to conform to peers begins early in life. Even preschoolers experience it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_50">Haun &#x0026; Tomasello, 2011</xref>). Even so, we suspect that most people associate peer pressure with the teen years, perhaps for good reason. Indeed, Knoll and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_65">2015</xref>) found that teens, compared to younger children and adults, were more likely to value the opinions of other teens than those of adults. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_74">McCoy (1991)</xref>, one study conducted on more than 3,000 teenagers found that more than two-thirds of them felt substantial peer pressure to have sex, drink, and take drugs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_45">Gordon (1986)</xref> found that peer pressure is the most important factor in determining whether teens begin smoking. Moreover, because teens so desperately want to be accepted by their peers, for those who do not believe that they fit in with groups that pressure them, the consequences can be severe. For instance, not fitting in can lead to depression, the number-one risk factor for teen suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_96">Royte, 1994</xref>). That being said, we must keep in mind that peer pressure is not always a bad thing. In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book, <italic>Join the Club</italic>, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_95">Tina Rosenberg (2011)</xref> argued that peer pressure, which she calls &#x201C;the social cure,&#x201D; can be used to transform the world for the better. As one example, she showed how groups of young nonsmokers with names such as &#x201C;Rage Against the Haze&#x201D; used peer pressure to cut the rate of teen smoking in half, something that government-led antismoking campaigns based on fear (e.g., smoking kills) were unable to do.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_144">144</target>Personality</title>
<p>Several studies have identified various aspects of personality that are related to conformity. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_17">Burger (1987)</xref> found that people high in the desire to control events in their lives react negatively to group pressure and are, therefore, less likely to conform than people with a low desire for control. Second, high self-monitors, who pay close attention to social cues on appropriate behavior, are more likely to conform than low self-monitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_103">Snyder, 1987</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_94">Rose, Shoham, Kahle, and Batra (1994)</xref> found that people who are high in the need for affiliation and group identification conform more than people without such needs.</p>

<title>Culture</title>
<p>After surveying more than 100,000 people in 40 different cultures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_53">Hofstede (1984)</xref> identified four different dimensions of values along which any culture can be placed. He labeled these dimensions <italic>power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity&#x2013; femininity,</italic> and <italic>individualism&#x2013;collectivism.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_72">Lustig and Cassotta (1996)</xref> argued that each of Hofstede&#x2019;s dimensions can be applied to the topic of conformity.</p>
<p>First, people from cultures that score high on power distance value hierarchy and obedience to authority, whereas those who score low on power distance prefer equality and participative decision making. For that reason, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_72">Lustig and Cassotta (1996)</xref> argued that people from cultures with low power-distance scores (e.g., Israel, Australia, western European countries) are less likely to conform than those from cultures with high power-distance scores (e.g., the Philippines, Mexico, Venezuela, India, Singapore).</p>
<p>Second, people from some cultures avoid uncertainty and have little tolerance for ambiguity, whereas people from other cultures are more at ease with the unknown. Because ambiguous stimuli foster conformity more than unambiguous stimuli, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_72">Lustig and Cassotta (1996)</xref> argued that cultures that are uncomfortable with ambiguous <target target-type="page" id="page_145">145</target>situations (e.g., Greece, Portugal, Japan, Peru, Chile, Spain) should conform more than cultures that are comfortable with ambiguity (e.g., the United States, Singapore, India, England, Sweden).</p>
<p>Third, some cultures can be characterized as &#x201C;masculine&#x201D; because people in them value competition, strength, assertiveness, and achievement, whereas others can be characterized as &#x201C;feminine&#x201D; because people in them value cooperation, affection, intuition, and nurturance. As such, members from masculine cultures (e.g., Japan, Italy, Austria, Mexico, England, Venezuela) should conform less than members from feminine cultures (e.g., Scandinavian countries, Portugal, the Netherlands).</p>
<p>Finally, while people in individualistic cultures value personal goals and self-autonomy, those in collectivistic cultures emphasize the importance of group goals and harmony. For that reason, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_72">Lustig and Cassotta (1996)</xref> argued that individualists (e.g., people from the United States, England, Australia, Canada, Italy, Denmark) are less conforming than collectivists (e.g., people from Colombia, Korea, Peru, Taiwan, Pakistan, Chile). A meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_12">Bond and Smith (1996)</xref> supports this conclusion, finding conformity to be much higher among collectivists than individualists. In fact, even when they are encouraged to dissent, collectivists resist doing so more than individualists do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_31">Curseu &#x0026; ten Brink, 2016</xref>). That said, although collectivists seem to be especially susceptible to normative influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_98">Savani, Wadhwa, Ulchida, Ding, &#x0026; Naidu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_79">Oh, 2013</xref>), additional research found no difference between them and individualists when it came to conforming to informational influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_79">Oh, 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Social Proof: Using the Sheep Factor to Persuade Others</title>
<p>&#x201C;But, Mom, <italic>everybody&#x2019;s</italic> doing it,&#x201D; is a familiar childhood refrain. Even so, children are not the only ones who pattern their behavior after others. Much adult behavior is based on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_25">Cialdini (1993)</xref> has termed <italic>social proof</italic>. Specifically, social proof is the tendency to view behaviors as more appropriate or correct when a lot of other people are engaging in such behaviors. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_25">Cialdini (1993)</xref>, however, although using social proof can be a handy shortcut for deciding how to behave, it can also make us vulnerable to the persuasive attempts of others. This is because we are more likely to engage in a behavior when persuaders lead us to believe that a lot of other people are engaging in that behavior.</p>
<p>One of the authors once met a person who makes money by playing a guitar and singing in subways and on street corners. The person explained that, even before she starts singing, she throws some of her own money into the open guitar case. Why? When people pass by, they think others have contributed and are more likely to do the same. Not surprisingly, this subway minstrel is not the only one who uses the principle of social proof to persuade others. In fact, the success of &#x201C;viral marketing&#x201D; (also discussed in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter1">Chapter 1</xref>) is largely based on this principle. In his bestselling book <italic>The Tipping Point</italic>, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_41">Malcolm Gladwell (2002)</xref> argued that in the same way a sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small group of influential people launch a fashion trend or boost the popularity of a new product. The idea is that consumers will see products being used or talked about by others and follow suit. This strategy of relying on social proof or word of mouth has become known as <italic>viral marketing</italic> and is catching on. Did you know, for example, that companies are hiring &#x201C;real people&#x201D; to use their products? These &#x201C;undercover&#x201D; <target target-type="page" id="page_146">146</target>consumers are meant to provide proof that the product is effective or worthwhile. For example, Hebrew National hired &#x201C;mom squads&#x201D; to host hotdog barbeques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_44">Goodman, 2001</xref>), and marketers for the energy drink Red Bull decided they didn&#x2019;t even need people to spread the word. Instead, they filled sidewalk trash cans and bar tables with empty cans of the stuff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_36">Eisenberg, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Once again, the idea is the same; if people see or hear about others using a product, they&#x2019;re more likely to try the product themselves. Research supports this notion as well. For example, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_29">Cody, Seiter, and Montagne-Miller (1995)</xref> found that when people are buying gifts for others, social proof is one of the most effective tactics that a salesperson can use. In fact, when salespersons told their customers that a particular product was &#x201C;the most popular,&#x201D; &#x201C;the best selling,&#x201D; or &#x201C;selling faster than we can bring them in,&#x201D; customers spent more money than when the salespersons used other tactics, such as praising the customer, doing favors for the customer, and trying to demonstrate expertise and trustworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_29">Cody et al., 1995</xref>). Why? It may be that people are less certain about purchases when buying for others than when buying for themselves.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, social media is a haven for social proof as well. Would it surprise you to learn, for example, that some bloggers earn &#x0024;100,000 or more per year to promote certain brands? It&#x2019;s true. Those bloggers may seem ordinary enough, but beware&#x2014;their brand choices are not always random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_110">Wolverson, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>From an organization&#x2019;s point of view, digital marketing can also be tricky. Indeed, although social media can garner a lot of attention, it can also backfire spectacularly. Consider what happened when a British government agency tried to drum up support for a &#x0024;287 million research ship by allowing Internet users to suggest and vote on names. Do you suppose they ended up with a dignified name like &#x201C;Shackleton,&#x201D; &#x201C;Endeavor,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Falcon&#x201D;? Not a chance. It turns out that voters went with &#x201C;Boaty McBoatface&#x201D; instead. Similarly, imagine Taylor Swift&#x2019;s surprise when Internet voters chose a school for the deaf as a concert location, or Slovakian legislators&#x2019; astonishment when the public voted to name a pedestrian bridge after the celebrity Chuck Norris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_93">Rogers, 2016</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6_1"><sup>1</sup></xref></p>
<p>Another method for sparking word-of-mouth marketing is a selling strategy known as <italic>group buying</italic>, which encourages individual customers to make purchases through buying groups in order to receive a discounted group rate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_61">Jing &#x0026; Xie, 2011</xref>). For example, a company might sell a &#x0024;100 item for &#x0024;75 if 20 people sign up to buy the item. As a result, customers who want the discount spread the word, essentially becoming sales agents for the company. The Internet, of course, is a ripe environment for this approach, and it is not surprising that a number of group-buying websites, such as Groupon.com, have emerged. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_24">Chen and Lu (2015)</xref>, group buying is effective for marketing products, especially when those products are endorsed by members of our reference groups.</p>
<p>That said, online customer reviews of products and services can also operate as social proof. Take, for example, the following reviews of vacation resorts adapted from Expedia.com (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_13">Book, Tanford, Montgomery, &#x0026; Love, 2015</xref>, p. 13):
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;We just got back yesterday and had the time of our lives! The resort was amazing &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_147">147</target>&#x201C;We cannot wait to go back!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let me give you the real &#x2018;5 Star review&#x2019;. If you like old, dirty and run down hotels&#x2014;5 stars! If you like hard beds and bring your own air mattress&#x2014;5 stars! If you like a cesspool for a swimming pool&#x2014;5 stars!&#x201D;</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>According to a study by Book and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_13">2015</xref>), reviews such as these function like traditional word of mouth, yet have the capability of reaching far more customers. If fact, such reviews can be more influential than prices, especially when they are unanimously positive or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_13">Book et al., 2015</xref>). Not surprisingly, online reviews are particularly persuasive when they contain quality information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_40">Filieri, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Social proof, of course, has the power to influence more than buying behavior, as illustrated in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_18">Burger and Shelton (2011</xref>, p. 74). Specifically, these researchers posted two signs near elevators. One, using social proof, read, &#x201C;More than 90 percent of the time, people in this building use the stairs instead of the elevator.&#x201D; The other sign said, &#x201C;Taking the stairs instead of the elevator is a good way to get some exercise.&#x201D; Within two weeks, the number of people using the elevator instead of the stairs dropped 46 percent, but only in the social proof condition. No change was observed with the sign that merely encouraged exercise.</p>
<p>Although social proof is probably a universally effective persuasion tactic, it may be more effective when used in some cultures than others. Recall, for example, our earlier discussion about the distinction between individualistic and collectivistic cultures. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_28">Cody and Seiter (2001)</xref>, because social proof is rooted in people&#x2019;s tendency to conform, it should be especially effective in collectivistic cultures where conformity is prevalent. This seems to be the case. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_26">Cialdini, Wosinska, Barrett, Butner, and Gornik-Durose (2001)</xref> conducted a study to see how well social proof worked in the United States (an individualistic culture) and Poland (a collectivistic culture). In the study, people from both cultures were asked to indicate how willing they would be to comply with three requests: once while considering that all their peers had complied with the request (high social proof), once while considering that half their peers had complied with the request (moderate social proof), and once while considering that none of their peers had complied (no social proof). Results of the study indicated that, in both cultures, as the level of social proof increased, so did compliance. This was especially true in Poland (Cialdini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_26">2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Ostracism: Shuns and Guns</title>
<p>In 1976, on the campus where one of the authors teaches, a disturbed man shot and killed six students and one communication professor. In 1999, at Columbine High School in Colorado, two students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, shot and killed 12 students and a teacher before committing suicide, and in 2007, Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people on the Virginia Tech campus before committing suicide. More recently, in 2012, a gunman killed 20 children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Sadly, such school shootings are all too prevalent. They leave us shaking our heads and asking, &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; What would lead people to do such horrible things? One explanation is <italic>ostracism</italic>, the act of excluding and ignoring <target target-type="page" id="page_148">148</target>others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_22">Carter-Sowell, Chen, &#x0026; Williams, 2008</xref>). Indeed, according to Zadro and Williams&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_111">2006</xref>) sources, the Columbine killers acted out as a form of retaliation after being shunned by their peers.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we have seen how people&#x2019;s desire to belong can lead them to conform to that group, even if they think the group is wrong. The study of ostracism underlines just how important this need can be and how desperate for attention ostracized people can become. By way of example, Carter-Sowell and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_22">2008</xref>) noted that the &#x201C;Bind, Torture, Kill&#x201D; serial killer was so desperate for recognition that he wrote about it to the press: &#x201C;How many do I have to kill, before I get my name in the paper or some national attention?&#x201D; (p. 144).</p>
<p>Although the act of ostracism does not always lead to such violent incidents, research suggests that it can affect behavior in other ways. For instance, in order to gain the acceptance they seek, ostracized people may behave in more socially acceptable ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_38">Feinberg, Willer, &#x0026; Schultz, 2014</xref>). As Carter-Sowell and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_22">2008</xref>) argued, however, the need to fit in may render ostracized people easy marks for persuaders. To test this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_92">Riva, Williams, Torstrick, and Montali (2014)</xref> conducted a study. In it, students played &#x201C;Cyberball,&#x201D; a computer ball-tossing game with two other players, who, unbeknown to the students, were actually computer generated and programmed to ostracize the students by hardly ever tossing the ball to them. After about two minutes of virtual shunning, the students were approached by the experimenter, who handed them a camera and commanded them to go outside when temperatures were below 30&#x00B0; Fahrenheit to take 39 creative pictures. As suspected, the students who had been ostracized were significantly more obedient. Judges rated their pictures to be significantly more creative than those taken by non-ostracized students.</p>

<title>Deindividuation, Social Loafing, and Social Facilitation: Getting Lost in the Crowd</title>
<p>In previous sections, we saw how people can be pressured to conform to a group. This, however, is not the only way that groups can influence an individual. In this section we examine how groups can affect a person&#x2019;s behavior by causing the person to lose his or her sense of self or by making the person feel less responsible for his or her actions.</p>
<sec id="sec6_3_1">
<title>What a Riot: An Examination of Deindividuation</title>
<p>Crowds influence people&#x2019;s behavior; once we get lost in them, we tend to do things that we would never do alone. If you don&#x2019;t believe us, ask our friend who was one of the 500,000 people at the Woodstock concert in 1969. She won&#x2019;t say whether she was one of the people running around naked, but she admits to doing things she wouldn&#x2019;t have done if she had not been lost in the crowd.</p>
<p>This tendency &#x201C;to get lost in the crowd&#x201D; was first labeled <italic>deindividuation</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_39">Festinger, Pepitone, and Newcomb (1952)</xref>. Deindividuation is said to occur when being in a group causes people to become less aware of themselves and less concerned with how others will evaluate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_33">Diener, 1980</xref>). Because being in a large group makes a person both more aroused and anonymous, the person focuses less on himself or herself and behaves more impulsively.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_149">149</target>Although running around naked at concerts may sound harmless enough, it is clear that deindividuation can have much more severe consequences. For example, one of the authors was a student at the University of Southern California when the Los Angeles riots broke out in 1992. Seeing firsthand the trashed storefronts and burnt buildings of the riot&#x2019;s aftermath made the potentially cruel nature of deindividuation all too real. The riots made it clear to everyone how powerful mob psychology can be: When one person starts wreaking havoc, others may be likely to follow. Consider, for example, the comments of a U.S. soldier trying to explain what caused him to kill innocent children and civilians during the My Lai massacre:
<disp-quote>
<p>I just went. My mind just went. And I wasn&#x2019;t the only one that did it &#x2026; a lot of people were doing it, so I just followed suit. I just lost all sense of direction, of purpose. I just started killing. I just started killing any kinda way I could kill. It just came. I didn&#x2019;t know I had it in me.</p>
<attrib>(Biton &#x0026; Sim, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_37">Epley &#x0026; Gilovich, 1999</xref>, p. 578)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A classic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_34">Diener, Fraser, Beaman, and Kelem (1976)</xref> illustrates how deindividuation can lead to such antisocial behavior. The researchers suspected that if any night of the year would lead to deindividuation, it was Halloween. To be sure, children usually trick-or-treat in groups and, because they wear costumes, are more anonymous than usual. To see if deindividuation would affect children&#x2019;s behavior, these researchers gave 1,352 trick-or-treaters, who were either trick-or-treating alone or in groups, the opportunity to steal candy or money from 27 homes in Seattle. How did the experiment work? When trick-or-treaters came to the door, an experimenter greeted them, commenting on their costumes. The experimenter asked some of the children their names, and other children were allowed to remain anonymous. The experimenter then left the room after telling the trick-or-treaters they could take one of the candies that was in a bowl near the door (there was also a bowl full of nickels and pennies). Unbeknown to the children, a hidden observer watched how much candy (and money) the children really took, and here&#x2019;s what the observer saw: When children were trick-or-treating alone, 7.5 percent of them took more candy than they were supposed to. When they were in groups, however, the thievery increased substantially; 20.8 percent stole candy. Moreover, when the children remained anonymous, they stole more candy and money than they did when the experimenter asked their names. In short, deindividuation led the trick-or-treaters to a night of petty crime.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most disturbing research on deindividuation focused on violent behaviors perpetrated in groups. First, in one study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_73">Mann (1981)</xref> examined more than 150 newspaper accounts of what happened when people threatened to kill themselves by jumping from buildings. Mann found that in some cases, people who had gathered on the streets below actually baited the potential jumpers, encouraging them to leap to their deaths. Can you guess what one of the factors was that caused observers to egg on jumpers? According to Mann, when the crowds contained more than 300 people, baiting was more common than it was in smaller crowds. This, of course, is consistent with the notion that larger crowds produce more deindividuation.</p>
<p>Second, in an even more disturbing study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_77">Mullen (1986)</xref> examined the relationship between the size of lynch mobs and the severity of atrocities committed <target target-type="page" id="page_150">150</target>by such mobs. To do so, he analyzed more than 300 newspaper reports to determine the following: (1) the number of people in each lynch mob; (2) whether the lynchings included violent acts, such as hanging, shooting, burning, lacerating, and dismembering the victims; and (3) whether the lynchings happened quickly or were prolonged and torturous. Results of the study indicated that victims suffered more when the lynch mobs were larger. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_77">Mullen (1986)</xref> concluded that &#x201C;these results support the contention that lynchers become less self-attentive, and thereby more likely to engage in acts of atrocity, as the lynchers become more numerous relative to the number of victims&#x201D; (p. 191).</p>
<p>Considering these studies, an important question concerns how deindividuation might be attenuated. Because deindividuation results from low self-awareness, the answer may lie in making people more aware of themselves. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_87">Prentice-Dunn and Rogers (1982)</xref>, however, there are two types of self-awareness and only one is related to deindividuation. First, <italic>public self-awareness</italic> refers to how we view ourselves as social objects and our concerns about such things as our appearance and the impression we are making on others. <italic>Private self-awareness</italic> refers to our focus on hidden aspects of ourselves such as our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_20">Buss, 1980</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_87">Prentice-Dunn and Rogers (1982)</xref> found that deindividuation is decreased only when a person&#x2019;s private self-awareness is increased. This suggests, then, that to attenuate deindividuation, the object is to get people focused on their own thoughts and feelings. Thus, rather than state that people will get in trouble for their actions or look bad for doing something, it may be better to have them reflect on their personal views on what is right and wrong. (For more on deindividuation in a specific context, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box6_3">Box 6.3</xref>.)</p>

<title>Social Loafing: Not Pulling Your Own Weight</title>
<p>Have you ever had to push a stalled car or move a heavy piece of furniture with several other people? If so&#x2014;be honest for a moment&#x2014;did you give it your all? Or, because there were others to share the burden, did you slack off a bit? If you&#x2019;re at all like the average research participant, you probably did not work as hard as you could have. Indeed, research suggests that when working in groups, people may not try as hard as they do when working alone (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_48">Harkins, Latan&#x00E9;, &#x0026; Williams, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_62">Karau &#x0026; Williams, 1993</xref>). In short, like a lot of other people, you may be a social loafer.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_62">Karau and Williams (1993)</xref>, &#x201C;social loafing is the reduction in motivation and effort when individuals work collectively compared with when they work individually or coactively&#x201D; (p. 681). What causes such loafing? There are several explanations, although we only have room to discuss the most prominent perspectives (for a review of others, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_47">Guerin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_63">Karau &#x0026; Williams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_70">Locke et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>First, the <italic>collective effort model</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_63">Karau &#x0026; Williams, 2001</xref>) argues that we tend to get lazy if we don&#x2019;t expect our efforts to lead to personally valued outcomes or if we don&#x2019;t think our effort will be instrumental in obtaining those outcomes. Thus, social loafing occurs because we don&#x2019;t think we will get the credit we are due or achieve the results we desire.</p>
<p>Second, the <italic>free ride effect</italic> suggests that when they can get away with it, people try to benefit from the efforts of others&#x2014;that is, they slack off when others are working, when they are anonymous, and when they don&#x2019;t think their own efforts will be <target target-type="page" id="page_151">151</target>evaluated. Working in groups not only allows them to &#x201C;hide in the crowd&#x201D; without getting blamed for poor work but also enables them to reduce their own effort and still enjoy an equal share of the rewards (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_63">Karau &#x0026; Williams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_70">Locke et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Computer-Mediated Conformity: When Group Members Flame the Same</title></caption>
<p>From what you&#x2019;ve read so far, you can see that being in the presence of a group can seriously affect your behavior. With that in mind, what do you suppose might happen if you were still able to communicate with a group but were removed physically from the group&#x2019;s presence? Liberation from social pressure? Freedom to do as you please without worrying about fitting in?</p>
<p>If that&#x2019;s what you were thinking, think again. Optimists once figured that email and the Internet might provide emancipation from group pressure, but empirical research suggests otherwise. For instance, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_109">Williams, Cheung, and Choi (2000)</xref> found that people using Internet chat rooms are likely to conform to the unanimous incorrect judgments of a group of strangers, especially after being ostracized by a previous group. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_86">Postmes, Spears, and Lea (2000)</xref> found that the same types of norms and conformity that occur in face-to-face groups evolve in computer-mediated groups as well.</p>
<p>With that said, you probably won&#x2019;t be surprised to learn that communicating via computer does not make you immune to negative behaviors often evidenced in groups. In fact, some studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_59">Jessup, Connolly, &#x0026; Tansik, 1990</xref>) suggest that the anonymity afforded to people who communicate via computers makes uninhibited and inappropriate behavior (e.g., insulting others, using profanity) more likely than it is in face-to-face conversations. Such &#x201C;flaming,&#x201D; as it is called in the world of computer users, has been blamed on deindividuation, which, as you already know, is fostered by anonymity.</p>
<p>The good news is that computer-mediated group communication does not necessarily lead to negative behavior, but rather positive or negative behavior depending on the norms of the group with which one is communicating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_104">Spears, Lea, &#x0026; Lee, 1990</xref>). Specifically, the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_85">Postmes, Spears, &#x0026; Lea, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_86">2000</xref>) argues that immersion in a group prompts greater conformity to the group&#x2019;s norms. Thus, if the group&#x2019;s norms are positive, you are more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors. If the group&#x2019;s norms are negative, you are more likely to &#x201C;flame.&#x201D;</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Finally, the <italic>sucker effect</italic> occurs when people suspect that others may be taking a free ride. Rather than be a &#x201C;sucker&#x201D; who does all the work, people slack off in order to match the level of work done by others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_70">Locke et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for social loafing, one thing is clear: It, like deindividuation, can have disastrous effects. For example, in Richmond, California, in 2009, at least a dozen bystanders watched as a 15-year-old girl was beaten and gang-raped outside the building where her high school homecoming dance was being held. The ordeal lasted more than two hours before anyone summoned help. Likewise, social loafing has been <target target-type="page" id="page_152">152</target>observed in laboratory research. For instance, in a study by Latan&#x00E9; and Darley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_68">1970</xref>), subjects were led to believe that they were having a conversation over an intercom with other subjects in the study. Some believed they were talking with only one other person; others believed they were talking with five other people. In reality, there were no other subjects, just tape-recorded messages. At one point during the conversation, one of the &#x201C;pretend subjects&#x201D; began choking and gasping as if having a seizure. Did the supposed victim receive help? The answer is &#x201C;it depends.&#x201D; When subjects thought they were in groups with five other people, only 30 percent of them helped. When the subject thought she or he was alone with the victim, 85 percent helped. The larger the group, the less likely people are to lend a hand.</p>
<p>Considering our discussion so far, you might be wondering how social loafing can be decreased. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_62">Karau and Williams (1993)</xref>, social loafing can be reduced or overcome by:
<disp-quote>
<p>providing individuals with feedback about their own performance or the performance of their work group, monitoring individual performance or making such performance identifiable, assigning meaningful tasks, making tasks unique such that individuals feel more responsibility for their work, enhancing the cohesiveness of work groups, and making individuals feel that their contributions to the task are necessary and not irrelevant.</p>
<attrib>(p. 700)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it may be easier to attenuate social loafing if you know the conditions under which it occurs. For instance, because loafing is more likely in larger groups, limiting the number of people in a group may be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_1">Aggarwal &#x0026; O&#x2019;Brien, 2008</xref>). Moreover, earlier in this chapter, we talked about how we are more likely to conform to groups with which we identify. Knowing this, it&#x2019;s not surprising to find that people who identify with a group are not as likely to loaf as those who do not identify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_10">Barreto &#x0026; Ellemers, 2000</xref>). For those who do not identify, another approach is to make them accountable for their work. Evidence for the effectiveness of this approach is mixed, however. For instance, while Aggarwal and O&#x2019;Brien (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_1">2008</xref>) found that university students were less likely to loaf on group projects when their peers evaluated them, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_35">Dommeyer (2007)</xref> did not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_71">Lount and Wilk (2014)</xref> found that employees were less likely to loaf when their performance was posted publicly, but argued that it was because doing so triggered social comparison between workers, which, in turn, increased their motivation to work hard.</p>
<p>Another variable that influences the potential for loafing is the nature of the people involved in the task, suggesting that before you join a group, you should know whom you&#x2019;re joining. First, research indicates that people who are open to new experiences, conscientious, agreeable, and high in the need for cognition (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter5">Chapter 5</xref>) are less likely to loaf than their counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_64">Klehe &#x0026; Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_102">Smith, Kerr, Markus, &#x0026; Stasson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_105">Tan &#x0026; Tan, 2008</xref>). Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_83">Pieterse and Thompson (2010)</xref> noted that <italic>diligent isolates</italic>, unlike social loafers, are people who increase their efforts and willingly work alone in an effort to rescue group projects. However, because they do not know how to delegate or have the social skills required for group projects, diligent isolates can be just as bad for group projects as social loafers. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_83">Pieterse and Thompson (2010)</xref> observed that the presence of diligent isolates promoted social <target target-type="page" id="page_153">153</target>loafing in other group members. Finally, the way in which people perceive themselves might influence the degree to which they loaf. Specifically, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_56">Huguet, Charbonnier, and Monteil (1999)</xref> found that people who see themselves as uniquely superior to others are most likely to loaf when working collectively on an easy task (i.e., imagining different uses for a knife). This is because they perceive their contribution to such a task as redundant, dispensable, and unlikely to make others aware of their superior talents. However, these types of people tend to work extra hard on difficult tasks (i.e., imagining different uses for a doorknob) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_56">Huguet et al., 1999</xref>) or when they perceive their teammates as being unequipped for handling the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_84">Plaks &#x0026; Higgins, 2000</xref>). And why not? Such <italic>social compensation,</italic> as it is called in the literature, helps them maintain the belief that they are unique and reap possible rewards if their group does well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_56">Huguet et al., 1999</xref>). What can we learn from such research? Consider this: If you ever ask a group to perform an easy task, watch out for people who think they&#x2019;re the cat&#x2019;s meow. If that sounds simple, consider one more thing: Most people see themselves as superior to the average person, a phenomenon known as <italic>self-serving bias</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_43">Goethals, Messick, &#x0026; Allison, 1991</xref>). Unfortunately, this probably means that when tasks are easy, there are a lot of loafers out there.</p>

<sec id="sec6_3_3">
<title>Social Facilitation: Would You Rather Be Alone?</title>
<p>The presence of other people does not always lead to loafing. In fact, it can have the opposite effect. Years ago, for example, when one of the authors was on his high school&#x2019;s track team, he ran &#x201C;practice races&#x201D; by himself, attempting to beat his best time. No matter how hard he tried, however, he could never match his performance in real races. He didn&#x2019;t know it then, but his faster times in real races were most likely the result of <italic>social facilitation</italic>, or rather, the tendency to perform better when other people are around (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_112">Zajonc, 1965</xref>). The effect has been demonstrated time and time again, but before you decide to surround yourself with spectators the next time you write a research paper, consider this: The presence of others tends to improve performance on simple or well-rehearsed tasks while impairing performance on complex or unfamiliar tasks. Not only that, it can affect your health and bankroll. Did you know, for example, that as the number of diners increases, so does the amount of food consumed, especially when the people are friends and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_23">Cavazza, Graziani, &#x0026; Guidetti, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_52">Herman, 2015</xref>)? Moreover, the energizing effects of being around other people might cause people to take greater risks. To illustrate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_91">Rockloff, Greer, and Fay (2011)</xref> observed people playing computerized slot machines alone or alongside others. Results revealed that people played faster and longer in the presence of other gamblers than when alone. The implications, of course, are that large commercial gaming venues might accelerate the pace at which gamblers part with their dough.</p>

<title>How Groups Affect Decision Making: To Risk or not to Risk</title>
<p>Imagine that you&#x2019;re the parent of a small child, a daughter, with a serious heart condition. Because of the condition, your daughter has to refrain from any activity that might put too much strain on her. Your child&#x2019;s doctor, however, presents you with some interesting news: There&#x2019;s a new surgery your child can have that will make her completely healthy. There&#x2019;s a catch, however: The doctor tells you that there is <target target-type="page" id="page_154">154</target>a 1 percent chance your child will die from the surgery. What choice would you make? Would you allow the doctor to perform the surgery? If you thought &#x201C;yes,&#x201D; imagine that the odds are different; instead of a 1 percent chance, what if there were a 50 percent chance your child would die?</p>
<p>Interestingly, research has shown that when selecting between alternatives like the preceding ones, groups and individuals make different decisions. The first study on this subject was conducted by Stoner (1961, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_15">Brauer, Judd, &#x0026; Gliner, 1995</xref>), who found that individuals made riskier decisions when they were in groups than they did when alone. In other words, while an individual might decide to allow the surgery when there was a 1 percent chance of death, a group might allow it when there was a 50 percent chance. Following Stoner&#x2019;s study, several other researchers confirmed these results, and soon this effect became known as the <italic>risky shift phenomenon.</italic> Not all studies, however, confirmed this phenomenon. In fact, some later studies found just the opposite effect. Sometimes groups made decisions that were <italic>less</italic> risky than those made by individuals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_78">Myers &#x0026; Arenson, 1972</xref>). How might such results be explained? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_78">Myers and Arenson (1972)</xref>, instead of a risky shift phenomenon, what actually occurs is a <italic>group polarization phenomenon.</italic> In short, groups cause people to become more extreme in their decisions. Thus, if you are predisposed to making a slightly risky decision, being in a group may cause you to make a riskier decision; if you are predisposed to make a conservative decision, being in a group may cause you to make an even more conservative decision. As you might suspect, as decisions become more extreme, they might also become less accurate. Indeed, in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_80">Palmer &#x0026; Loveland, 2008</xref>), poor, good, and average lecturers were evaluated by individuals or by people who engaged in group discussions. Results showed that group discussion led to less accurate ratings of the lecturers.</p>
<p>Although there are many explanations for why group polarization occurs, two are most prominent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_14">Boster, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_15">Brauer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_81">Pavitt, 1994</xref>). The first, <italic>social comparison theory</italic>, argues that we learn about ourselves by comparing ourselves to others. Because most people are average, when they compare their view to the views of others, they don&#x2019;t find much difference. Interestingly, however, because most people want to see themselves in a positive light, they don&#x2019;t want to be average; they want to be &#x201C;better than average.&#x201D; Thus, according to this theory, when people learn that their position is the same as that of everyone else in the group, they shift their position so that it is more extreme. Because everyone tends to do this, group polarization occurs.</p>
<p>A second perspective, <italic>persuasive arguments theory</italic>, asserts that, before entering a group discussion, each member has one or more arguments that support his or her own position. If you consider all these arguments together, there will be more supporting one position than another (e.g., there may be more support for a risky decision than there is for a conservative one). Persuasive arguments theory asserts that the position that has the best and largest number of arguments supporting it is the position toward which members shift.</p>
<p>Several authors have argued that these theories are not contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_14">Boster, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_57">Isenberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_81">Pavitt, 1994</xref>). In other words, <italic>both</italic> social comparison and persuasive arguments might contribute to group polarization. In addition, Brauer and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6_15">1995</xref>) have argued that a third process might contribute to the extreme decisions made by groups. They noted that although social comparison and persuasive <target target-type="page" id="page_155">155</target>arguments explanations both focus on interpersonal processes (e.g., what we hear from other group members), <italic>intra</italic>personal processes also may affect polarization. Specifically, they argued that when making decisions in groups, we not only hear from other group members, we state our own opinion and defend it several times. Such repetition, they argued, also moves us toward polarization.</p>
<p>Before concluding this section, we wish to point out that, like the other topics we&#x2019;ve discussed in this chapter, group polarization can have disastrous effects. For instance, imagine being on the front lines in a hopeless battle. Who would you want deciding whether you should take a hill: one military leader or a group of them? How about if a decision were being made to start a war or launch a missile? Or imagine an innocent person accused of a crime. Would he or she be better off with or without a jury deciding on a verdict? You get the idea. As frequent members of groups, it is important to remember the effects that groups can have on us. Only then might we hope to be less vulnerable to their influence.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In this chapter we examined several topics related to influence in groups. First, we discussed early research on conformity and saw that several perspectives explain why people tend to conform. In addition, several factors (i.e., group size, moral conviction, having an ally, the intensity of indoctrination, the degree to which we identify with a group, communicator characteristics, and culture) influence how likely we are to conform. We also saw that social proof can be a powerful persuasive tactic because it relies on people&#x2019;s tendency to conform. We then saw that the presence of others can lead to deindividuation, social loafing, and social facilitation. Finally, for various reasons, groups tend to make more extreme decisions than do individuals (group polarization).</p>

<p>WHEN WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE WROTE, &#x201C;A rose by any other name would smell as sweet,&#x201D; he found an eloquent way to note that words and the things they represent have no necessary connection. Indeed, you can&#x2019;t change a flower&#x2019;s scent just by renaming it &#x201C;armpit&#x201D; or &#x201C;manure.&#x201D; That being said, sometimes the names we give things affect how we react to those things. For example, because we attach meanings to words and names, we might react differently to a woman named Rose than we would to a man with the same name. As another illustration, consider the story of Adolf Hitler Campbell, a 3-year-old from Hunterdon County, New Jersey, whose parents were unable to get a supermarket to write the child&#x2019;s name on his birthday cake, presumably because of the connotations associated with such an infamous name. After meeting with resistance, the family, including Adolf&#x2019;s little sister, Joyce-Lynn Aryan Nation Campbell, hightailed it to Pennsylvania, where a Walmart employee was willing to produce their cake (&#x201C;Three-year-old Hitler,&#x201D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_68">2008</xref>).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_163">163</target>These examples illustrate an interesting property of language that is one of the main themes of this chapter. Specifically, because we associate meanings with words, words have the power to influence us. Indeed, the maxim &#x201C;The pen is mightier than the sword&#x201D; is correct. Words are the primary means of persuasion. They not only affect our perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and emotions but they also create reality.</p>
<p>Because words are so important in the process of persuasion, the purpose of this chapter is to examine words and their effects on social influence. We begin by discussing the nature of symbols and of meaning, which are integral to understanding the relationship between language and persuasion.</p>
<sec id="sec7_1">
<title>Symbols, Meaning, and Persuasion: The Power of Babble</title>
<p>What is a <italic>symbol?</italic> A very basic definition is that a symbol is something that represents something else. Names are a good example. Your name represents who you are, just as the word <italic>pig</italic> represents an animal with a curly tail and slimy snout.</p>
<p>As noted above, one important characteristic of symbols is that they are arbitrary. In other words, symbols have no necessary connection to what they represent, although we sometimes seem to forget this. For example, S. I. Hayakawa (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_1">Adler, Rosenfeld, &#x0026; Towne, 1995</xref>) told the story of a little boy who thought that pigs were called pigs because they are so dirty. The word <italic>pig</italic>, however, has no direct connection to the curly-tailed animal, just as your name, although it may seem to fit, has no necessary connection to you&#x2014;that is, when your parents were trying to decide what to call you, there was nothing written in stone that said you had to be given a certain name. You could just as easily have been called Binky or Unga Bunga. Don&#x2019;t laugh&#x2014;the singer Frank Zappa named his children Moon Unit and Dweezil, and when tax authorities told a Swedish couple that they had to give their 5-year-old son a name or pay a fine, the couple named the child Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclnmckssqlbb11116 (&#x201C;The best and worst,&#x201D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_4">1996</xref>). As wrong as such names might seem, however, they&#x2019;re not. When it comes to finding representations of things, there&#x2019;s not one &#x201C;right&#x201D; word or symbol.</p>
<p>Because they are arbitrarily connected to what they represent, a second characteristic of symbols is that they are conventionalized, which means that if we want to use a symbol to communicate to someone else, we have to agree on the symbol&#x2019;s meaning. Without some measure of agreement on the meanings of words, communication and persuasion would be difficult, if not impossible. If you&#x2019;ve ever tried to communicate with someone who speaks a different language, you know this is true.</p>
<sec id="sec7_1_1">
<title>Connotative and Denotative Meaning: That&#x2019;s Not How I See It</title>
<p>Up to this point, we&#x2019;ve noted how important it is for communicators to agree on the meaning of the symbols they use. With that said, however, we are certain that, without telepathy, total agreement on the meaning of symbols is impossible. Of course, the degree to which people agree may depend on the type of meaning with which we&#x2019;re concerned. There are at least two meanings for every word. The first, the <italic>denotative</italic> meaning, is a word&#x2019;s direct, explicit dictionary definition.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_164">164</target>The second type of meaning, <italic>connotative</italic>, refers to the thoughts and emotions associated with a word. As you might expect, the connotations associated with words vary widely from person to person. To illustrate, let&#x2019;s return to pigs. Although all of us might agree on the denotative meaning of the word <italic>pig</italic> (i.e., curly-tailed animal with snout), our attitudes associated with the word may be quite different. For instance, compared to a farmer&#x2019;s child who grew up sloppin&#x2019; hogs, a person who grew up reading books or watching movies about cuddly, talking pigs, such as Wilbur from <italic>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web</italic> or Babe from the movie <italic>Babe,</italic> would probably have a different view of pigs. In contrast, the members of some religious groups, Jews and Muslims, are forbidden to eat pork, which is perceived as unclean. Not long ago, in fact, a woman in Israel was sentenced to 50 years for depicting Allah as a pig.</p>
<p>As persuaders, it is important to recognize that the meanings of words are subjective. As scholars in the field of communication are fond of saying, &#x201C;Meanings are in people, not in words.&#x201D; Effective persuaders are aware of this and attempt to adapt their messages accordingly.</p>

<title>Ultimate Terms: Speak of the Devil</title>
<p>Although connotative meanings tend to be more subjective than denotative meanings, sometimes the connotations associated with certain words are shared by large groups of people (i.e., societies and cultures). As a result, such words can be powerfully persuasive tools for motivating people. This is especially true of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_70">Richard Weaver (1953)</xref> labeled <italic>ultimate terms,</italic> which are words or phrases that are highly revered, widely accepted, and carry special power in a culture. According to Weaver, there are three types of ultimate terms. The first, <italic>god terms,</italic> carry the greatest blessing in a culture and demand sacrifice or obedience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_23">Foss, Foss, &#x0026; Trapp, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_27">Hart, 1997</xref>). When Weaver wrote, he used terms such as <italic>fact</italic> and <italic>progress</italic> as examples of god terms. Modern-day god terms include <italic>family values</italic>, <italic>critical thinking</italic>, and <italic>teachable moment</italic>.</p>
<p>In contrast to god terms, Weaver argued that some terms, which he labeled <italic>devil terms,</italic> are perceived by a culture as associated with the absolutely abhorrent and disgusting. Examples of past devil terms include <italic>communism</italic>, <italic>Nazi</italic>, and <italic>fascist</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_23">Foss et al., 1985</xref>). Today, terms such as <italic>dead-beat dad</italic>, <italic>racist</italic>, <italic>terrorist</italic>, <italic>child molester</italic>, <italic>sweat shop</italic>, and <italic>hate crime</italic> might be considered devil terms. Because such terms represent what is evil or detestable to a culture, they can also be extremely persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_27">Hart, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, Weaver labeled a third type, <italic>charismatic terms.</italic> Unlike god and devil terms, which are associated with something observable, charismatic terms, much like a charismatic person, have a power that in some ways is mysteriously given (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_23">Foss et al., 1985</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;Freedom&#x201D; and &#x201C;democracy&#x201D; are charismatic terms in our culture. We demand sacrifice in the name of these terms, yet the referents most of us attach to them are obscure and often contradictory. In fact, Weaver says, we may resist the attempt to define such terms, perhaps fearing that a term defined explicitly will have its charisma taken away.</p>
<attrib>(p. 66)</attrib>

</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_165">165</target>What becomes clear, then, is that although god, devil, and charismatic terms have power, their ability to persuade is not stable; the connotations associated with such terms may change over time. For instance, calling someone a communist today would not have the same impact as it did in the days of Senator Joseph McCarthy.</p>
<p>Considering the power of ultimate terms, it is not surprising that politicians spend considerable amounts of money discovering the &#x201C;right&#x201D; terms to use in their ads and speeches. By way of example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_39">Lemann (2000)</xref> noted that politicians use focus groups in order to discover specific words that should and should not be used in campaigns. The people in such groups watch ads and speeches while moving dials from right to left, indicating when they like or dislike what they are hearing and seeing. As a result, politicians learn an entirely new vocabulary of god and devil terms. For example, based on his research with focus groups, Frank Luntz, a political consultant, advises his candidates to say
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;Department of Defense&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Pentagon,&#x201D; &#x201C;opportunity scholarships&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;vouchers,&#x201D; &#x201C;tax relief&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;tax cuts,&#x201D; and &#x201C;climate change&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;global warming.&#x201D; The terms &#x201C;Washington&#x201D; and &#x201C;I.R.S.,&#x201D; Luntz says, always play as super-negative and should be attached to a policy you want to turn people against. &#x201C;Prosperity&#x201D; is super-positive. In general, words starting with an &#x201C;r&#x201D; or ending with an &#x201C;-ity&#x201D; are good&#x2014;hence &#x201C;reform&#x201D; and &#x201C;accountability&#x201D; work and &#x201C;responsibility&#x201D; really works.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_39">Lemann, 2000</xref>, p. 100)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Politicians might also use language to create other images. For instance, following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, George W. Bush used words such as <italic>evil</italic>, <italic>those people</italic>, and <italic>demons</italic> to characterize people of Arab/ Middle Eastern descent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_47">Merskin (2004)</xref> argued that Bush&#x2019;s speeches were carefully constructed and that the use of such words creates an enemy image by dehumanizing the &#x201C;other.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In addition to politicians, people in the business world are fond of using ultimate terms as persuasion devices. For instance, the word <italic>empowerment</italic> is a modern-day charismatic term on which marketers and advertisers have capitalized. Products and services that promise to <italic>empower</italic> people have become unavoidable. For instance, as a former suit salesman, one of the authors was regularly asked by customers where the &#x201C;power ties&#x201D; could be found or what was the &#x201C;power color&#x201D; for ties this year. The Hotel del Coronado in Southern California offers its guests &#x201C;power walks&#x201D; in the morning, and one of our colleagues told us about a seminar his sister attended that teaches its clients how to take &#x201C;power naps.&#x201D; Finally, one of the authors was recently notified that he is a <italic>Time</italic> magazine &#x201C;Power Subscriber.&#x201D; He can now read the news with gusto.</p>
<p>Other terms that seem to have appeal these days are <italic>extreme</italic>, <italic>alternative</italic>, and <italic>indie</italic>. Indeed, these words are popular now as &#x201C;rebel&#x201D; labels for things. There is, of course, alternative music and alternative clothes (e.g., baggy pants, visible boxer shorts, tattoos, piercings). There are also extreme sports, such as snowboarding, bungee jumping, skateboarding, and mountain biking. But does placing words in front of something necessarily make it cooler, or more &#x201C;edgy&#x201D;? Is &#x201C;alternative golf&#x201D; <target target-type="page" id="page_166">166</target>really alternative simply because the people playing it have man buns and wear tennis shoes (instead of golf shoes)? Does throwing some bacon and Monterey cheese on a Whopper really make it an &#x201C;Xtreme burger,&#x201D; as Burger King claims?</p>
<p>What is clear from this discussion is that words, when widely accepted as representing what is good or evil in a culture, have incredible persuasive potential. As we&#x2019;ve noted, being labeled a communist in the 1950s was hazardous. In the late 1600s, being labeled a witch in Salem, Massachusetts, was deadly. In the current political climate, labeling one&#x2019;s opponent as a socialist or fascist seems to be popular. A little later, we explore more thoroughly the power of such labeling. But first, we examine a topic related to ultimate terms.</p>

<title>Aphorisms and Familiar Phrases: That Rings a Bell</title>
<p>Aphorisms are sayings, maxims, and adages that offer advice. They may be time honored (e.g., &#x201C;look before you leap&#x201D;) or more contemporary (&#x201C;love is fleeting, herpes is forever&#x201D;). They are found in economics, politics, religion, science, and everyday life. We see them on bumper stickers, political slogans, and advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Aphorisms are persuasive because they are succinct, easily remembered, and appear to contain &#x201C;truisms.&#x201D; And because they are pithy, they require far less explanation. For example, the political expression &#x201C;A rising tide lifts all boats&#x201D; captures the essence of &#x201C;trickle-down economics,&#x201D; whereby economic policies that benefit the rich also benefit everyone else. Although some aphorisms may offer bad advice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_40">Levine and Bleakley (2012)</xref> argue that aphorisms are undervalued in medicine. For example, simple adages, such as &#x201C;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&#x201D; and &#x201C;What you don&#x2019;t know can hurt you,&#x201D; are efficient ways of explaining the value of preventive medicine. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_69">Vernon (2008)</xref> highlighted the importance of aphorisms in modern politics. &#x201C;In an age when the average attention span is apparently decreasing,&#x201D; he noted, &#x201C;the sagacious sound-bite could yet become the solution to&#x2014;rather than a symptom of&#x2014;the tendency to dumb down&#x201D; (p. 50). Texting, tweeting, and other social media seem ripe for persuasion in the form of aphorisms.</p>
<p>When are aphorisms most persuasive? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_30">Howard (1997)</xref> conducted a study to find out when familiar phrases are influential. Using the elaboration likelihood model (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter2">Chapter 2</xref>) as a theoretical base, Howard suspected that familiar phrases would be most persuasive when people weren&#x2019;t able or motivated to scrutinize a message&#x2014; that is, familiar phrases, Howard thought, would act as peripheral cues to persuasion. To test this idea, he had groups of students listen to radio commercials trying to persuade them to plan for retirement. The commercials contained either familiar phrases (e.g., &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t put all your eggs in one basket&#x201D;) or literal phrases (e.g., &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t risk everything on a single venture&#x201D;). Half the students were able to carefully attend to the commercials, but the rest were distracted (i.e., they were asked to watch and record the nonverbal behavior of another person in the room). Results of the study indicated that the students who viewed commercials with familiar phrases were more persuaded than those who had not, but only when they were distracted. Those who were not distracted were persuaded (by strong arguments), regardless of whether familiar or literal phrases were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_30">Howard, 1997</xref>).</p>

<p>What is love? It depends, apparently, on whom you ask. Various singers, for instance, have called it &#x201C;a losing game&#x201D; (Amy Winehouse), &#x201C;a battlefield&#x201D; (Pat Benatar), &#x201C;a rose&#x201D; (Neil Young), &#x201C;a tower&#x201D; (U2), and &#x201C;a piano dropped from a fourth-story window&#x201D; (Ani DiFranco). In each of these cases, love was depicted through the use of metaphors, which are figures of speech that compare two things. In the process, aspects of one thing are transferred to the second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_62">Sopory &#x0026; Dillard, 2002</xref>). It turns out that singers are not the only ones who are fond of using metaphors. Persuaders like them too, perhaps for good reason. Indeed, metaphors are persuasive (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_17">Chang &#x0026; Yen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_62">Sopory &#x0026; Dillard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_66">Thibodeau, 2016</xref>). Thus, when Tropicana calls its orange juice &#x201C;Your daily ray of sunshine&#x201D; and Skittles invites you to &#x201C;taste the rainbow,&#x201D; they&#x2019;re not just being smart, they&#x2019;re clever foxes.</p>

<title>The Power of Labeling</title>
<p>Earlier, we stated that names such as Dweezil and Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmn-prxvclnmckssqlbb11116 are not wrong, but we might have misled you. As arbitrary symbols, they work just fine, but pragmatically, how would you like to be saddled with such a name? Perhaps you wouldn&#x2019;t mind, but, whatever the case, one thing is clear: The name you use affects the way people respond to you. In fact, we know a person who changes his name every decade because he says that people respond differently to him depending on whether he&#x2019;s a Richard, a Jay, or a Hank. And research supports the idea that our friend is not simply a kook. For instance, according to the sources of Adler and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_1">1995</xref>), compared to names like Percival, Elmer, Isadore, and Alfreda, common names such as John, Michael, Karen, <target target-type="page" id="page_168">168</target>and Wendy are rated as more likable, active, and stronger. Moreover, when such names were placed on essays and evaluated by teachers, the more common names tended to receive higher grades than the less common ones. Finally, in a small study, a graduate student at MIT put 24 photos on the website <uri>www.hotornot.com</uri>. Interestingly, with different first names attached, the same photos were judged as more &#x201C;hot&#x201D; or more &#x201C;not&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_64">Strasser, 2005</xref>, p. E22).</p>
<p>It turns out that your name doesn&#x2019;t just affect how others behave or perceive you; it affects how you behave and perceive yourself as well. People, it seems, respond favorably to their own names. Several studies, for example, indicate that diners leave higher tips when food servers use their names than when they do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_61">Seiter, Givens, &#x0026; Weger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_59">Seiter &#x0026; Weger, 2013</xref>). In one such study, food servers who had learned their customers&#x2019; names (by reading them on credit cards as customers paid their bills) addressed those customers in one of several ways. Specifically, they addressed customers (1) by using their first names (e.g., &#x201C;Thank you, Babbs.&#x201D;); (2) by using their titles plus last names (e.g., &#x201C;Thank you, Mr. Jones.&#x201D;); (3) by being formal yet impersonal (e.g., &#x201C;Thank you, sir/ma&#x2019;am.&#x201D;); or by using no form of address (i.e., &#x201C;Thank you.&#x201D;). Results of the study showed that diners left significantly higher tips in the first two conditions, with younger customers preferring to be addressed by their first names and older customers (age 54 and up) preferring to be addressed by their titles plus last names (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_59">Seiter &#x0026; Weger, 2013</xref>). Similarly, research shows that people purchased more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_32">Howard &#x0026; Gengler, &#x0026; Jain, 1995</xref>) and complied more quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_31">Howard &#x0026; Gengler, 1995</xref>) when their names were used than when their names were not used.</p>
<p>The power of labels extends far beyond the names that people are given (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box7_1">Box 7.1</xref>). To be sure, the labels we use to describe people or things reflect our attitudes about them and affect others&#x2019; reactions to the people and things labeled. For example, many years ago, children with divorced parents came from &#x201C;broken homes.&#x201D; Talk about stigmatization! Nowadays, we say children belong to &#x201C;single-parent&#x201D; or &#x201C;blended&#x201D; families.</p>
<p>The notion that the labels we use affect our attitudes about what we label lies at the heart of criticisms aimed at sexist language. For example, if a professor refers to all of his male students as &#x201C;men&#x201D; or &#x201C;sirs&#x201D; and to all of his female students as &#x201C;girls,&#x201D; &#x201C;broads,&#x201D; or &#x201C;dears,&#x201D; it not only says something about the professor&#x2019;s attitudes toward men and women but it also has the power to shape attitudes. Thus, when women are wrongly described in ways that make them seem inferior to men, people may begin to believe that women truly are inferior.</p>
<p>This is related to an idea that is commonly known as the <italic>Sapir&#x2013;Whorf hypothesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_57">Sapir, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_71">Whorf, 1956</xref>). The &#x201C;hard&#x201D; version of the hypothesis is deterministic, arguing that language dictates thought. The &#x201C;soft&#x201D; version is that language influences or affects thought. We subscribe to the latter view. For example, some languages assign gender to nouns. In German, doctor (<italic>der Doktor</italic>) is masculine, whereas nurse (<italic>die Krankenschwester</italic>) is feminine. If a German girl asks, &#x201C;What can I be when I grow up, mommy?&#x201D; the mother may be more likely to say a doctor than a nurse. Meanwhile, although it doesn&#x2019;t shove, the language provides a nudge.</p>
<p>The same dynamics are at work when people use racist language, which perpetuates the illusion that one racial group is superior to another. Ethnic/cultural references carry vastly different meanings. For example, Americans with an African <target target-type="page" id="page_169">169</target>heritage have been identified by terms such as <italic>African American, black, Negro, colored,</italic> and more derogatory terms as well. Such derogatory terms, whether racist or sexist, have the power to shape perceptions. One study, for example, found that referring to Mexican immigrants as &#x201C;illegal aliens&#x201D; (which connotes criminality) invoked greater prejudice than referring to them as &#x201C;undocumented workers&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_53">Pearson, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>In this chapter, we&#x2019;ve shown that names affect how we react to people. As you might have suspected, they also influence our reaction to products. For example, did you know that people react more favorably to sweaters and jellybeans that are given ambiguous color names (e.g., Moody Blue, Alpine Snow, and Monster Green) than less ambiguous color names (e.g., blueberry blue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_48">Miller &#x0026; Kahn, 2005</xref>)? Considering this: it&#x2019;s not surprising that a lot of attention goes into naming products. This may be especially true when naming prescription drugs.</p>
<p>Most of us refer to prescription drugs by their brand names. For example, we say &#x201C;Prozac&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;fluoxetine&#x201D; and &#x201C;Valium&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;diazepam.&#x201D; We do this because we&#x2019;ve been trained to by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Drug companies engage in &#x201C;branding&#x201D; when they air commercials and print ads urging us to &#x201C;ask your doctor about ____________.&#x201D; Is the Purple Pill right for you? Ask your doctor, but first go to the company&#x2019;s website for more online propaganda to offer your doctor.</p>
<p>Naming a drug is extremely important to how the drug is perceived by consumers/patients and, in turn, to the drug maker&#x2019;s bottom line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_36">Kirkwood, 2003</xref>). The name has to be short (no more than three syllables), unique, easy to pronounce, easy to remember, and, importantly, it must convey the essence of what the drug does. But the name cannot be false or misleading, according to the FDA. Viagra, a pill for erectile dysfunction sufferers, is a classic case of the power of naming as it applies to drugs. The name Viagra was conjured up to convey two themes: vigor, virility, or vitality and power or force, such as the raw power of Niagara Falls. Yes, the Freudian association with a torrent of powerful water is intentional. Viagra sounds more manly than sildenafil citrate, its generic name, don&#x2019;t you think? Celebrex, an arthritis medicine, was so named because it suggests celebrating&#x2014;celebrating one&#x2019;s freedom to move without pain.</p>
<p>Companies such as the Brand Institute and Name Base/Medibrand are paid &#x0024;250,000 or more to come up with names for drugs that conjure up idealized associations. See if you can guess the positive associations pharmaceutical manufacturers are trying to create for the following drugs.
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Alleve: hint&#x2014;it <italic>alleviates</italic> something, right? (and that something happens to be minor arthritis pain).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Ambien: hint&#x2014;it creates a soothing <italic>ambience</italic> (to help you sleep better).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Claritin: hint&#x2014;it <italic>clarifies</italic> things, like watery eyes and a runny nose due to allergies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Levitra: hint&#x2014;it <italic>levitates</italic> something (need we say more?).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Prevacid: hint&#x2014;it <italic>prevents</italic> something (and that something has to do with the last four letters of its name. Sounds better than its generic name, lansoprazole, doesn&#x2019;t it?).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Propecia: hint&#x2014;it <italic>propagates</italic> something (like hair restoration).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The letters X and Z are popular in drug names because people think they sound scientific, hence names like Nexium, Paxil, Vioxx, Zanex, Zocor, and Zoloft. Now that you know how drugs are named, see if you can come up with effective names for hypothetical new drugs that would help Alzheimer&#x2019;s sufferers, diabetics, or kids with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Finally, consider these names: &#x201C;Citizens for the Environment,&#x201D; &#x201C;National Wetlands Coalition,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Greening Earth Society.&#x201D; Which would you say sounds the most environmentally friendly? Would it surprise you to learn that they&#x2019;re all names for anti-environmental think tanks? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_13">Bricker (2014)</xref>, those names weren&#x2019;t accidental either. They were chosen on purpose to hide the organizations&#x2019; true intent: to prevent environmental regulations. By pretending to be environmentally friendly, they were more effective at manipulating public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_13">Bricker, 2014</xref>). This practice of posing as a nonprofit group in order to exploit others has been called <italic>astroturfing</italic> or <italic>astroturf activism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_21">Durkee, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Euphemisms and Doublespeak: Making the Worse Appear the Better and Vice Versa</title>
<p>In the fifth century BCE, a group of teachers known as Sophists created private schools in Athens, Greece. Students who wanted to learn from the Sophists were charged fees and were taught, among other subjects, oratory and persuasion. Soon, however, being a Sophist was so profitable that the occupation attracted a number of charlatans, who gave the Sophists a bad reputation (today, <italic>sophistry</italic> connotes deceitful or fallacious reasoning). In fact, Plato argued that the Sophists were more interested in lies than truths and more interested in dazzling audiences than in instructing them. Sophists, Plato argued, were skilled at making the &#x201C;worse cause appear the better&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_18">Corbett, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>The practice of using words to make the worse appear the better (and vice versa) is still alive and well. Modern-day Sophists commonly use <italic>doublespeak</italic> (ambiguous or evasive language) and <italic>euphemisms</italic> (inoffensive terms substituted for offensive ones) to create messages with less sting. For example, in the business world, no one gets fired or laid off any more. Instead, companies engage in &#x201C;downsizing,&#x201D; &#x201C;right-sizing,&#x201D; or even &#x201C;bright-sizing.&#x201D; Mercedes no longer sells used cars; it sells &#x201C;pre-owned automobiles&#x201D; (try asking the Mercedes dealer, &#x201C;Was this car previously used, or simply owned?&#x201D;). Other companies give their employees job titles that sound more important or grandiose than they really are. A garbage collector is now a &#x201C;sanitation engineer.&#x201D; And, in Great Britain, legislation was introduced to substitute the stigmatized word <italic>prostitute</italic> with the phrase <italic>person who sells sex persistently</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_63">Stinchfield, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of doublespeak and euphemisms is rampant in other places as well. For example, the military refers to civilian casualties, killing enemy soldiers, and combat operations as &#x201C;collateral damage,&#x201D; &#x201C;servicing the target,&#x201D; and &#x201C;peacekeeping missions,&#x201D; respectively. Flight attendants don&#x2019;t talk about crashing in the ocean, only &#x201C;water landings&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_49">Murphy, 2001</xref>). In the medical field, terms such as <italic>assisted suicide</italic>, <italic>transsexual surgery</italic>, and <italic>cancer</italic> might instead be labeled <italic>hastening death</italic> (or <italic>death with dignity</italic>), <italic>gender reassignment</italic>, and <italic>a growth</italic>, respectively. Media reports use <target target-type="page" id="page_171">171</target>words like &#x201C;terrorism&#x201D; and &#x201C;terrorist&#x201D; less and less often, relying instead on ambiguous terms such as &#x201C;assailants,&#x201D; &#x201C;militants,&#x201D; &#x201C;extremists,&#x201D; and &#x201C;attackers&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_42">Matusitz, 2016</xref>). Politicians don&#x2019;t raise taxes or lie, they adopt &#x201C;revenue enhancing measures&#x201D; and &#x201C;misremember.&#x201D; And one of our friends is not allowed to have parties in her high school classes so, instead, has &#x201C;reinforcement for desirable behavior days.&#x201D; In the world of undertakers and funeral directors, people &#x201C;pass away&#x201D; rather than die, are &#x201C;interred&#x201D; rather than buried, and are called &#x201C;cases&#x201D; or &#x201C;patients&#x201D; rather than corpses. Instead of saying &#x201C;No,&#x201D; parents are fond of saying &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll see&#x201D; or &#x201C;Maybe later.&#x201D; And finally, in the abortion controversy, the words you use probably depend on the side you take. For example, <italic>pro-life</italic> is more value-laden than <italic>anti-abortion</italic> or <italic>anti-choice. Pro-choice</italic> avoids the term <italic>abortion</italic> altogether and sounds much nicer than <italic>anti-life</italic> or <italic>anti-anti-abortion.</italic></p>
<p>In the midst of all this word spinning, researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_43">McGlone &#x0026; Batchelor, 2003</xref>) have identified two possible motives people might have for using euphemisms. First, people might use euphemisms because such words are less threatening and more respectful, therefore saving the &#x201C;face&#x201D; of audience members. Second, people might use euphemisms in order to be regarded as tasteful and sensitive, thereby saving their own &#x201C;face.&#x201D; To test these competing explanations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_43">McGlone and Batchelor (2003)</xref> asked students communicating with someone via computer to describe various photographs, including two that depicted the aftermath of a urinating dog and a defecating parrot. Some students were led to believe that their identity would later be revealed to the person they were communicating with, while others were not. Results showed that the first group of students was more prone to using euphemisms, suggesting that saving their own face seemed to be their priority. It turns out, however, that when trying to create favorable impressions by spinning words, not <target target-type="page" id="page_172">172</target>just any euphemism will do. Indeed, a study by McGlone, Beck, and Pfeister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_44">2006</xref>) found that because euphemisms with longer &#x201C;careers&#x201D; (e.g., &#x201C;use the restroom,&#x201D; &#x201C;go number two&#x201D;) are more familiar and draw less attention, people who use them are perceived more favorably than those who use newer, less familiar euphemisms (e.g., &#x201C;make room for tea,&#x201D; &#x201C;cast a pellet&#x201D;) (for more on doublespeak, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box7_2">Box 7.2</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>If You Can&#x2019;t Say Something Nice, Spin It</title></caption>
<p>If you&#x2019;ve ever been asked to serve as a reference for someone, you know that it can be a complex business. Because what you say may no longer be confidential, saying something negative can lead to all kinds of personal and legal tangles. With that in mind, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_67">Robert Thornton (2003)</xref> has created the <italic>Lexicon of Inconspicuously Ambiguous Recommendations</italic> (LIAR). Here are some examples of what to say about people, depending on their flaws:
<disp-quote>
<p>If the person is inept: &#x201C;I recommend this man with no qualifications whatsoever.&#x201D; (p. 33)</p>
<p>If the person is extremely lazy: &#x201C;In my opinion, you will be very fortunate to get this person to work for you.&#x201D; (p. 5)</p>
<p>If the person is chronically absent: &#x201C;A man like him is hard to find.&#x201D; (p. 19)</p>
<p>If the person is dishonest: &#x201C;The man is simply an unbelievable worker.&#x201D; (p. 33)</p>
<p>If the person is a drunk: &#x201C;We remember the hours he spent working with us as happy hours.&#x201D; (p. 20)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although we don&#x2019;t actually recommend using this lexicon, we think it is an entertaining way to illustrate how tricky language can be.</p>

<title>Language Intensity, Vividness, and Offensiveness</title>
<p>So far, we&#x2019;ve examined the nature of symbols and how they relate to the notion of meaning and the process of persuasion. We now turn to a discussion of specific variables related to language and persuasion. Three of these include language intensity, vividness, and offensiveness. These three variables are closely related. For example, when studying intense language, some authors include reviews of research on profanity, which, of course, has the potential to be quite offensive. However, it is possible to use intense language without being offensive. Moreover, although some definitions imply that vividness is a component or outcome of intense language (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_26">Hamilton &#x0026; Stewart, 1993</xref>), others do not (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_8">Bowers, 1964</xref>). Because these three topics are so closely related, we examine them together in this section. We then turn to a discussion of several theories that have been used to explain the relationship between intense language and persuasion.</p>
<sec id="sec7_2_1">
<title>&#x0023;&#x0023;&#x0040;!!!!&#x0023;&#x0023;: Profanity and Persuasion</title>
<p>Even though profanity, like any symbol, is arbitrary, it clearly plays a role in the process of persuasion, mostly because such strong connotations are associated with swearing. Perhaps this is why ancient rhetoricians like Quintilian advised against using profanity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_56">Rothwell, 1971</xref>). Because profanity is so common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_15">Cameron, 1969</xref>), <target target-type="page" id="page_173">173</target>some authors have asserted that it merits more attention as a form of persuasion. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_56">J. Dan Rothwell (1971)</xref> argued:
<disp-quote>
<p>Despite centuries of negative criticism, verbal obscenity has become a more frequent rhetorical device. It is successful in creating attention, in discrediting an enemy, in provoking violence, in fostering identification, and in providing catharsis. Its effects are governed by a variety of circumstances which need to be understood more fully. It has precipitated a police riot, brutal beatings, and even death. Hoping it will go away will not make it so. It is time to accept verbal obscenity as a significant rhetorical device and help discover appropriate responses to its use.</p>
<attrib>(p. 242)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>To explore more thoroughly people&#x2019;s perceptions of profanity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_3">E. Scott Baudhuin (1973)</xref> gave students &#x201C;swear word&#x201D; booklets and asked the students to evaluate several words according to how offensive they were. Based on the students&#x2019; perceptions, he found that the words could be categorized into one of three categories: religious, excretory, and sexual. Which type of profanity did students find most offensive? The results of the study indicated that sexual words received the most negative responses. Religious profanities were perceived to be the least offensive.</p>
<p>If profanity is perceived to be offensive, are people who use it perceived negatively and are they less persuasive? Several studies have been conducted to test this question and most, but not all (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_55">Rassin &#x0026; Van Der Heijden, 2005</xref>), indicate that if you want to be perceived as attractive, credible, and persuasive, you should clean up your language. For example, a study by Powell and his colleagues asked students to evaluate applicants who either did or did not cuss during a job interview. The researchers found that applicants with filthy mouths, regardless of their gender, were perceived as significantly less attractive than their counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_54">Powell et al., 1984</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_7">Bostrom, Baseheart, and Rossiter (1973)</xref> found that, in general, using profanity damages a speaker&#x2019;s credibility. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_58">Scherer and Sagarin (2006)</xref> noted that society&#x2019;s stance about swearing has become more relaxed since many of these earlier studies were conducted. As such, they revisited the relationship between obscenity, credibility, and persuasion by having students listen to speeches in which a male speaker either did or did not use the word <italic>damn</italic>. Results showed that cussing had no effect on perceptions of the speaker&#x2019;s credibility, but when the speaker cussed, he was more persuasive than when he did not. Before you decide to become potty-mouthed the next time you&#x2019;re speaking, however, consider this: the students in this study were listening to speeches in favor of lowering tuition, a topic they presumably would be in favor of. In contrast, most of the classic studies on this topic asked participants to listen to topics they did not favor. In short, it may be that profanity is persuasive, but only under very specific conditions. Indeed, two studies found that perceptions of cussing depend on additional variables. Specifically, and not surprisingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_35">Johnson and Lewis (2010)</xref> found that people who cussed in formal settings were perceived as significantly less competent than people who cussed in less formal settings. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_34">Johnson (2012)</xref> found that when cussing violated audience expectations in a positive way (e.g., people rated themselves as positively surprised by the cussing), ratings of the speaker&#x2019;s competence increased. Another study found that <target target-type="page" id="page_174">174</target>college students had mixed reactions when their instructors cussed. While the majority of students reported neutral to positive emotions, many reacted negatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_24">Generous, Houser, &#x0026; Frei, 2015</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec7_2_2">
<title>Political Correctness</title>
<p>Obviously, using profanity is not the only way to be verbally offensive. Earlier we discussed the notion of political correctness, which, in many ways, is all about being nonoffensive. Indeed, political correctness refers to issues of inclusive speech and advocacy of nonracist, nonageist, and nonsexist terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_28">Hoover &#x0026; Howard, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Although political correctness is relevant to a wide range of contexts and topics, including issues of gender, race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, and so forth, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_60">Seiter, Larsen, and Skinner (1998)</xref> focused on political correctness as it related to speaking about people with disabilities. In the study, college students read one of four hypothetical scenarios, each involving a person seeking donations who portrayed people with disabilities as &#x201C;normal&#x201D; (e.g., &#x201C;uses a wheelchair&#x201D;), &#x201C;heroic&#x201D; (e.g., &#x201C;handicapable&#x201D;), &#x201C;disabled&#x201D; (e.g., &#x201C;confined to a wheelchair&#x201D;), or &#x201C;pathetic&#x201D; (e.g., &#x201C;abnormal&#x201D;). After reading the scenarios, participants rated the speakers on scales measuring credibility and persuasiveness. Results of the study showed that, compared to communicators who portrayed people with disabilities as &#x201C;pathetic,&#x201D; communicators who portrayed such people as &#x201C;normal,&#x201D; &#x201C;heroic,&#x201D; and &#x201C;disabled&#x201D; were perceived as significantly more trustworthy and competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_60">Seiter et al., 1998</xref>). However, only communicators portraying people with disabilities as &#x201C;heroic&#x201D; and &#x201C;disabled&#x201D; were perceived as more persuasive than the communicator portraying such people as &#x201C;pathetic.&#x201D; How did the authors interpret these results? Perhaps by trying <italic>not</italic> to portray people with disabilities as victims, the communicator <target target-type="page" id="page_175">175</target>using &#x201C;normal&#x201D; language also did not demonstrate as urgent a need to help people with disabilities as the communicators using &#x201C;disabled&#x201D; and &#x201C;heroic&#x201D; language did (e.g., a child described as &#x201C;being confined to a wheelchair,&#x201D; or one who is aggrandized, may be perceived as requiring more help than a child described as &#x201C;using a wheelchair&#x201D;). Whatever the case, the results of this study suggest that individuals seeking donations for people with disabilities face a dilemma: How can a person raise money to help people with disabilities while at the same time describing people with disabilities in a politically correct and dignified manner?</p>

<title>The Effects of Vividness: A Picture&#x2019;s Worth a Thousand Words</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_51">Nisbett and Ross (1980)</xref>, vivid information captures and holds our attention and excites our imagination because it is &#x201C;emotionally interesting, concrete and imagery-provoking, and proximate in a sensory, temporal, or spatial way&#x201D; (p. 45). By way of example, it&#x2019;s more vivid to say &#x201C;the glass crashed and shattered into pieces&#x201D; than it is to say &#x201C;the glass broke.&#x201D; Although previous research is somewhat inconsistent, a meta-analysis of over 40 studies found that vivid messages tend to be more persuasive than pallid ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_6">Blonde &#x0026; Girandola, 2016</xref>). This is especially true when vividness helps receivers recall information.</p>

<title>Language Intensity</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;You are shockingly stupid&#x201D; versus &#x201C;You are not real smart.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The lumber industry is raping our forests&#x201D; versus &#x201C;The lumber industry is cutting down a lot of trees.&#x201D;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the preceding pairs of phrases, which phrase has the strongest connotative meaning? Obviously, the first phrase in each pair. The terms <italic>shockingly</italic> and <italic>raping</italic> <target target-type="page" id="page_176">176</target>are more intense than terms found in the other phrases. Language that is intense is emotional, metaphorical, opinionated, specific, forceful, extreme, and evaluative. For that reason, perhaps, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_8">Bowers (1964)</xref> defined <italic>language intensity</italic> as &#x201C;the quality of language which indicates the degree to which the speaker&#x2019;s attitude deviates from neutrality&#x201D; (p. 215). Clearly, someone who compares &#x201C;cutting down trees&#x201D; to &#x201C;rape&#x201D; is far from neutral in his or her attitudes about the lumber industry. But is a person who uses such language persuasive? The best answer to that question may be &#x201C;it depends.&#x201D; To be sure, several variables have been found that affect the persuasiveness of intense language. With that said, let&#x2019;s examine four different theories that attempt to explain when and why intense language does or does not persuade.</p>
<p>First, <italic>reinforcement theory</italic> assumes that people are motivated to avoid pain and seek pleasure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_10">Bradac, Bowers, and Courtright (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_11">1980</xref>) assumed that the same is true when people are being persuaded. If a person generally agrees with the position advocated by a source, the person will find it rewarding and evaluate the source positively. The reverse is true if the person generally disagrees with the position advocated by the source. Language intensity is believed to enhance this effect. Specifically, if the listener generally agrees with the speaker, when the speaker throws some forceful language at the listener, the listener is even more motivated to agree. However, a listener who generally disagrees will react even more negatively than he or she normally would when the speaker uses intense language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_11">Bradac et al., 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>A second perspective on language intensity is found in <italic>language expectancy theory</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_14">Burgoon &#x0026; Siegel, 2004</xref>). This theory assumes that we have expectations about what types of language are normal to use when trying to persuade other people. For example, we may not think it is normal for a speaker to use intense words such as <italic>rape</italic> and <italic>shockingly</italic>. According to language expectancy theory, when persuaders violate our expectations concerning normal language, those violations can either help or hurt the effectiveness of the persuasive message, depending on whether the violations are perceived in a positive or negative way. How violations are perceived depends on who is using the language. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_14">Burgoon and Siegel (2004)</xref> noted that highly credible sources are granted a &#x201C;wider bandwidth&#x201D; of acceptable communication than those with low credibility. As such, sources with low credibility are likely to be perceived in a negative way when they use language that is aggressive and intense. This, in turn, leads them to be less persuasive. The reverse is true for highly credible sources. For sources with non-established levels of credibility, using intense language may cause them to be perceived as less credible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_33">Jensen, Averbeck, Zhang, &#x0026; Wright, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_26">Hamilton and Stewart (1993)</xref> have extended <italic>information processing theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_45">McGuire, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_46">1989</xref>) to explain the effects of intensity on persuasion. The theory argues that to be persuaded, you must first attend to and comprehend a persuasive message. If you attend to and comprehend the message, you then compare your own position on the message to the position that&#x2019;s being argued by the source. Ultimately, you may either accept or reject the source&#x2019;s position. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_26">Hamilton and Stewart (1993</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_19">Craig &#x0026; Blankenship, 2011</xref>), language intensity affects this process by making a source&#x2019;s position on an issue seem more extreme compared to your own position. This can be good, up to a point. In general, some discrepancy between a persuader and a receiver&#x2019;s positions leads to <target target-type="page" id="page_177">177</target>increased attention and, therefore, more attitude change. However, as we noted in our discussion of social judgment theory in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter5">Chapter 5</xref>, too much discrepancy may lead a receiver to reject a message or to scrutinize a message so much that he or she fails to attend to all of the message&#x2019;s content. In addition, intense language tends to be more specific and vivid.</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>communication accommodation theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_25">Giles &#x0026; Wiemann, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_65">Street &#x0026; Giles, 1982</xref>) argues that when we communicate with others we adjust our style of speaking to their style in order to gain approval and increase communication efficiency. For example, we may try to talk the same way others talk so that they will like us better. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_2">Aune and Kikuchi (1993)</xref> conducted a study to see if this theory would predict the effectiveness of messages that either were or were not intense. In the study, speakers delivered intense and nonintense messages to people whose language style could be categorized as either intense or nonintense. Results of the study supported communication accommodation theory. Specifically, speakers using intense language were most persuasive with people who use intense language, whereas speakers using nonintense language were most persuasive with people who use nonintense language. Speakers who &#x201C;matched&#x201D; the style of their audience also were perceived as more credible.</p>

</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_178">178</target>As noted previously, a considerable amount of research indicates that using these powerless forms of speech can prevent you from being persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_22">Erickson et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_50">Newcombe &#x0026; Arnkoff, 1979</xref>), even when you are using strong arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_29">Hosman &#x0026; Siltanen, 2011</xref>). However, the relationship between power and speech may depend on additional factors. Two are noteworthy.</p>
<p>First, the type of powerless language a person uses may influence how he or she is perceived. Specifically, one problem with some research on powerless language is that it has lumped together all of the powerless forms previously discussed. However, some research indicates that this may not be the best idea, because not all the forms may be detrimental to a speaker. For instance, in one study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_9">Bradac and Mulac (1984)</xref> found that using polite forms actually enhanced speakers&#x2019; credibility. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_20">Durik, Britt, Reynolds, and Storey (2008)</xref> found that the use of colloquial-sounding hedges (e.g., &#x201C;kind of,&#x201D; &#x201C;sort of&#x201D;) undermined persuasive attempts, but the use of professional-sounding hedges (e.g., &#x201C;probably,&#x201D; &#x201C;may,&#x201D; &#x201C;seem to&#x201D;) did not.</p>
<p>Second, the type of language that is most effective may depend on who is using it. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_5">Blankenship and Craig (2007)</xref> found that when low credible sources used tag questions, the sources were less persuasive regardless of whether their messages contained strong or weak arguments. In contrast, when highly credible sources used tag questions, the sources were more persuasive, but only when their messages contained strong arguments. Why? Presumably, if you already believe a source is credible, tag questions get you to think more carefully about the message being presented. If the message is strong, you will be more persuaded by it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_5">Blankenship &#x0026; Craig, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to sources&#x2019; credibility, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7_16">Carli (1990)</xref> found that sources&#x2019; and receivers&#x2019; sex affects the persuasiveness of language. Specifically, females were persuasive with men when they used powerless forms of speech but persuasive with females when using powerful speech. For male speakers, it did not matter what form of speech was used. This may mean that women, compared to men, need to be more sensitive about the style of speech they use when trying to be persuasive. Clearly, along with the topics we discussed earlier, the results of this study suggest that men have negative stereotypes about women who use powerful speaking styles.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In this chapter, we examined the role of language in the process of persuasion. We began with an examination and definition of the term <italic>symbol.</italic> Symbols are arbitrary but have the power to shape perceptions and construct social reality. Symbols also have connotative and denotative meanings, both of which affect persuasion. For example, we examined ultimate terms, which, because of their strong connotations, have incredible persuasive power in a culture. We also examined the power of labels and how, oftentimes, through the use of euphemisms and doublespeak, persuaders attempt to lessen (or strengthen) the connotative impact of a word. Finally, we discussed several language variables that affect persuasion. By making their words more vivid, intense, offensive, and powerless/powerful, persuaders affect the way audiences respond to their messages.<target target-type="page" id="page_179">179</target></p>

<p>SHELLEY&#x2019;S BOYFRIEND WAS PROBABLY frowning as he watched one of this book&#x2019;s authors reach out and take Shelley&#x2019;s hand. At the time, the author was not thinking about Shelley&#x2019;s boyfriend, though; he was thinking about how pretty Shelley was. He remembers leaning toward her and gazing into her eyes. Her lips tightened into a grin as she squeezed the author&#x2019;s hand. He&#x2019;d never talked to her before this and was nervous, but even so, he had no trouble finding words. They came out smooth and suggestive. &#x201C;Pass the salt,&#x201D; he whispered. And, after swallowing hard and leaning even closer, he repeated those words&#x2014;&#x201C;Pass the salt, pass the salt&#x201D;&#x2014;again and again.</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t get the wrong idea. Even after writing a book about persuasion, neither author is even close to Don Juan status. When one of us met Shelley years ago, he was a sophomore in college, where he, Shelley, and Shelley&#x2019;s boyfriend were taking an acting class. As part of an exercise, the instructor paired each of us students up with a stranger and asked us to convince the rest of the class that we were deeply and passionately in love. &#x201C;Pass the salt,&#x201D; however, was the only phrase we were allowed to use.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the author is not sure how persuasive an actor he was, but he did learn something that day: The words &#x201C;I love you&#x201D; are not all they are cracked up to be. Sure, it&#x2019;s nice to hear those words, but if you can convey the same meaning with &#x201C;pass the salt,&#x201D; who needs them? The point here is that, when we are trying to <target target-type="page" id="page_184">184</target>interpret meaning, there is a lot more involved than simply words. As the old saying goes, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not what a person says, it&#x2019;s <italic>how</italic> the person says it that&#x2019;s important,&#x201D; which is why it is crucial that we understand something about nonverbal communication&#x2014; how we say things through the use of gestures, body movements, touch, spatial behavior, appearance, eye contact, and so forth. In this chapter, we are interested in focusing on one particular question about nonverbal communication&#x2014;that is, in what way does nonverbal communication influence the process of persuasion?</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_22">Burgoon (1994)</xref>, nonverbal communication plays an important role in the process of social influence for several reasons. First, we can use nonverbal behavior to create certain impressions of ourselves. If we are successful in making ourselves appear powerful, authoritative, credible, or attractive, we may also be more persuasive. (For a different twist on nonverbal behavior and impression management, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box8_1">Box 8.1</xref>.) Second, through the use of nonverbal behaviors, people can establish intimate relationships. In other words, nonverbal cues, such as touch, can be influential in developing rapport. Third, nonverbal behaviors can heighten or distract attention from persuasive messages that are likely to reinforce learning. For example, a teacher can use nonverbal cues to get his or her students to pay more attention to a message, and a heckler can use such tactics to distract listeners. Fourth, through non-verbal cues, a person can be reinforced to imitate a model&#x2019;s behavior. Fifth, nonverbal cues can be used to signal a person&#x2019;s expectations and elicit behavior that conforms to those expectations. For example, a simple frown can inform a child that he or she is not behaving appropriately. And finally, nonverbal behaviors can be used to violate people&#x2019;s expectations so as to distract them. Later in the chapter, for instance, we&#x2019;ll see that standing too close to another person can, under some circumstances, make that person more compliant.</p>
<p>Of course, we don&#x2019;t have the space needed in one chapter to discuss every aspect of nonverbal communication. We have, therefore, chosen to focus on those areas that we find the most important and intriguing. We begin by discussing a model that suggests that the relationship between nonverbal behavior and persuasion is quite simple.</p>

<caption><title>Smirks and Sneers Behind Your Back: Influencing Impressions of Others</title></caption>
<p><italic>Impression management theory</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_34">Goffman, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_99">Schlenker, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_121">Tedeschi &#x0026; Reiss, 1981</xref>) suggests that people control their behaviors&#x2014;particularly nonverbal behaviors&#x2014;in order to create desired impressions of themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_71">Leathers, 1997</xref>). If you want to be liked, for instance, you might smile. If you want to be intimidating, you might frown. Clearly, however, our nonverbal behavior can affect impressions other than those made about us. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_102">Seiter (2001)</xref>, for example, argued that impression management theory should be expanded to include the ways in which we strategically attempt to control impressions made of others. Although such attempts might be aimed at making others appear better, Seiter maintained that sometimes our attempts to appear honest and desirable are undermined by others&#x2014;that is, sometimes other people may attempt to make us appear undesirable and dishonest.</p>
<p>One context in which such attempts might occur is a political debate. Indeed, because candidates&#x2019; versions of a story often differ, they may look for opportunities to make their opponents appear <target target-type="page" id="page_185">185</target>deceptive. For instance, in the last several presidential debates, where split screens allowed viewers to see both the speaker and nonspeaking debater simultaneously, candidates were criticized for their silent, yet derogatory, background behavior.</p>
<p>To see if such background behavior is effective in undermining an opponent, Seiter and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_101">Seiter, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_102">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_103">Seiter, Abraham, &#x0026; Nakagama, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_107">Seiter &#x0026; Weger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_108">Seiter, Weger, Kinzer, &#x0026; Jensen, 2009</xref>) conducted studies that asked students to watch one of four versions of a televised debate. One version used a single-screen presentation showing only the speaker, while the other three versions used a split-screen presentation in which the speaker&#x2019;s opponent displayed constant, occasional, or no nonverbal disbelief regarding the content of the speaker&#x2019;s message. In other words, in some versions of the tape, the nonspeaking debater was shown shaking his head, rolling his eyes, and frowning while his opponent was speaking. After watching the videos, students rated the debaters. Results indicated that, in general, when any background disbelief was communicated by the nonspeaking debater, the speaker&#x2019;s credibility improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_103">Seiter et al., 1998</xref>). However, when the audience was led to be suspicious of the debaters&#x2019; truthfulness, moderate background behavior on the part of the nonspeaking debater made his speaking opponent appear more deceptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_102">Seiter, 2001</xref>). Be warned, however. If you&#x2019;re ever in a debate and are thinking about silently deriding your opponent, you&#x2019;ll probably hurt your own image in the process. To be sure, the studies also found that any derogatory background behavior led the nonspeaking debater to be perceived as more deceptive, less credible, less likable, and inappropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_101">Seiter, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_102">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_108">Seiter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_107">Seiter &#x0026; Weger, 2005</xref>). Finally, if an opponent ever confronts you with such nonverbal behaviors, research generally suggests that you&#x2019;ll be perceived as most effective if you politely and directly ask him or her to stop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_130">Weger, Seiter, Jacobs, &#x0026; Akbulut, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_131">2013</xref>).</p>

<title>The Direct Effects Model of Immediacy</title>
<p>People who study nonverbal behavior use the term <italic>immediacy</italic> to describe actions that communicate warmth, closeness, friendliness, and involvement with other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_3">Andersen, 2004</xref>). If, for instance, you smile, make a lot of eye contact, nod, and lean forward when talking to someone else, you are demonstrating some common immediacy cues. According to the <italic>direct effects model of immediacy</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_3">Andersen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_100">Segrin, 1993</xref>), there is a simple relationship between nonverbal behavior and social influence&#x2014;that is, warm, involving, immediate behaviors lead to increased persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_3">Andersen, 2004</xref>). As you&#x2019;ll see in the remainder of this chapter, a considerable amount of research supports this model and the effectiveness of immediacy behaviors in a number of different contexts, including intercultural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_12">Booth-Butterfield &#x0026; Noguchi, 2000</xref>), medical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_62">Kafetsios, Anagnostopoulos, Lempesis, &#x0026; Valindra, 2014</xref>), educational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_79">Mazer &#x0026; Stowe, 2016</xref>), organizational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_122">Teven, 2007</xref>), athletic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_124">Turman, 2008</xref>), and interpersonal settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_53">Hinkle, 1999</xref>). However, some research presents a more complicated picture. As we turn now to a discussion of the different types of nonverbal behavior, you will see that demonstrating immediacy may generally be a good rule of thumb, but an awareness of other factors may be necessary to sort out the sometimes complex relationship between nonverbal behaviors and persuasion.</p>

<sec id="sec8_2">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_186">186</target>Types of Nonverbal Communication</title>
<p>Before discussing specific forms of nonverbal behavior, we think it&#x2019;s important to point out that such behaviors are interdependent. By way of illustration, we should probably tell you that the &#x201C;Shelley story&#x201D; is not yet over. There&#x2019;s still the part about Shelley&#x2019;s boyfriend, Louis, who responded to the &#x201C;pass the salt&#x201D; line by attacking the author after class. With eyes wide and fists clinched, Louis called the author a &#x201C;lousy something-or-other&#x201D; and then slugged him. In response, the author merely chuckled, because he could see that Louis was only having fun; Louis was smiling, and the punch was only a playful &#x201C;tap.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As it turns out, Louis&#x2019;s behavior was probably not all that uncommon. Indeed, like us, you may have seen people (probably men) play-fighting as a means of greeting one another. But how do we know that they are only playing? We know because we don&#x2019;t see <italic>only</italic> their punches or <italic>only</italic> their eyes; we see other cues that help us interpret their messages. In other words, although there are many types of nonverbal communication, they do not occur in isolation. Nonverbal behaviors occur simultaneously, and how we interpret one behavior can affect our interpretations of other behaviors. Thus, although we discuss each of the following codes separately, it is important to realize that each code rarely operates alone.</p>
<p>With that said, we now examine seven types of nonverbal communication that are important in the process of persuasion: kinesics, haptics, proxemics, chronemics, artifacts, physical appearance, and paralinguistics.</p>
<sec id="sec8_2_1">
<title>Kinesics: Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes, Knees and Toes</title>
<p>The word <italic>kinesics</italic> was derived from the Greek term <italic>kinein,</italic> which means &#x201C;to move&#x201D; and refers to the study of eye contact, facial expressions, gestures, and body movements and posture. We start by taking a look at eye contact.</p>
<sec id="sec8_2_1_1">
<title>The Eyes Have It</title>
<p>Several years ago, one of the authors was involved in a study that investigated the influence strategies used by panhandlers when attempting to get money from strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_97">Robinson, Seiter, &#x0026; Acharya, 1992</xref>). As part of the study, 36 panhandlers were interviewed, and several claimed that, before even asking for money, the first thing they tried to do was establish eye contact with whoever was passing by. Without eye contact, the beggars argued, it was easier for their &#x201C;targets&#x201D; to ignore them and walk on by.</p>
<p>If eye contact helps beggars get more money, does it also help communicators to be more persuasive? Some evidence seems to support this notion. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_86">Murphy (2007)</xref> found that people who looked more at their interaction partners while speaking and listening were perceived as more intelligent than those who did not. Moreover, in a meta-analysis of several studies on eye contact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_100">Segrin (1993)</xref> found that in all but one study, gazing at listeners produced more compliance than averting gaze.</p>
<p>Conversely, communicators who do not use eye contact may have problems being persuasive. Gu&#x00E9;guen and Jacob (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_45">2002</xref>), for example, found that people, especially females, were less likely to comply when persuaders quickly averted their glance than when they maintained eye contact. Similarly, three studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_134">Wirth, Sacco, Hugenberg and Williams (2010)</xref> indicated that people who perceived averted eye gaze from others, compared to those who did not, felt more ostracized, more negative emotions (e.g., anger and sadness), and more temptation to perform aggressive behaviors. Finally, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_87">Neal and Brodsky (2008)</xref> found that expert witnesses who maintained less eye contact with jurors and attorneys were perceived as less credible than witnesses who maintained more eye contact. Perhaps this is why law students are taught to block eye contact between witnesses and jurors during cross-examination while encouraging their witnesses to make eye contact with jurors during direct examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_16">Brodsky, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_187">187</target>Before concluding this section, we should note that more eye contact is not always associated with greater persuasion. Indeed, some situations call for less eye contact. That&#x2019;s because a fixed gaze can be perceived as a challenge or threat. Stare at someone too long on a New York subway, and you might find someone saying, &#x201C;Hey, you lookin&#x2019; at me?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Whachu lookin&#x2019; at?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Finally, a classic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_65">Kleinke (1980)</xref> illustrates that the effectiveness of eye contact may depend on other factors, such as the legitimacy of the request you make. In the study, persuaders were instructed to approach people in an airport and ask them for money. Some of the targets were told that the money would be used to make an important phone call (a legitimate request), whereas others were told that the money would be used to pay for a candy bar or gum (an illegitimate request). It turned out that people who thought the persuader needed to make a phone call gave more money, but only when the persuader looked at them. Interestingly, however, eye contact actually decreased compliance when the persuader made an illegitimate request (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl8_1">Table 8.1</xref>). Perhaps, as the researcher suggested, looking away while making an illegitimate request makes a person seem more humble or embarrassed, thereby increasing his or her persuasiveness by winning the sympathy of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_65">Kleinke, 1980</xref>).</p>

<title>About Face</title>
<p>Of all possible facial expressions, smiling has probably been studied the most. To be sure, research has shown that by smiling, waitresses earn more tips (Tidd &#x0026; Lockard, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_44">Gu&#x00E9;guen &#x0026; Fischer-Lokou, 2004</xref>), therapists are judged to be warmer and more competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_71">Leathers, 1997</xref>), job interviewees create positive impressions of themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_129">Washburn &#x0026; Hakel, 1973</xref>) and are more likely to get jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_31">Forbes &#x0026; Jackson, 1980</xref>), female hitchhikers get more rides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_44">Gu&#x00E9;guen &#x0026; Fischer-Lokou, 2004</xref>), students accused of cheating are treated with greater leniency <target target-type="page" id="page_188">188</target>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_68">LaFrance &#x0026; Hecht, 1995</xref>), and teachers inspire students to pay more attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_98">Saigh, 1981</xref>). One study found that right after being smiled at, people were more willing to help a third person who dropped some computer disks on the ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_42">Gu&#x00E9;guen &#x0026; De Gail, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>We do not, however, want to give you the impression that influence is always as easy as a smile. As noted in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter4">Chapter 4</xref>, persuaders need to come across as trustworthy and sincere. Not all smiles accomplish this goal, however. One study, for example, found that when smiles appear quickly, the smiling person is perceived as less trustworthy and attractive than when smiles have a slower onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_67">Krumhuber, Manstead, &#x0026; Kappas, 2007</xref>). Besides that, smiling may not fit the situation. Consider, for instance, advertisements seeking donations for starving children. One study found that when 4- and 8-year-olds were pictured with sad facial expressions, they generated more sympathy and donations than when they were pictured with smiles (Baberini, Coleman, Slovic, &#x0026; V&#x00E4;stfj&#x00E4;ll, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_7">2015</xref>). Additionally, in situations where an angry or dominant demeanor would be most persuasive, positive and likable facial expressions could be counterproductive. For instance, one study found that, although smiling and nodding were more persuasive when used by people of equal status, dominant behaviors are more effective in established hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_82">Mehrabian &#x0026; Williams, 1969</xref>). Another found that while politically conservative audiences prefer leaders with dominant faces, politically liberal audiences prefer leaders with non-dominant ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_69">Laustsen &#x0026; Petersen, 2016</xref>). And still another found that angry facial expressions led audiences to scrutinize messages and, consequently, to prefer stronger over weaker arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_24">Calanchini, Moons, &#x0026; Mackie, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The situational nature of facial expressions and other nonverbal behaviors is even more apparent if you consider <italic>communication accommodation theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_32">Giles &#x0026; Wiemann, 1987</xref>), which we discussed in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter7">Chapter 7</xref>. According to the theory, rather than using any one type of nonverbal behavior, a persuader should try to build rapport with others by <italic>mirroring</italic> or <italic>mimicking</italic> their nonverbal cues. In other words, smile when people smile and frown when people frown. For example, in one study (Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_46">2009</xref>), 66 males interacted in speed-dating sessions with women who had been instructed beforehand either to mimic or not mimic the males&#x2019; behavior (e.g., the mimickers stroked their faces or crossed their arms when the males did). Results indicated that women who mirrored the males&#x2019; behavior, compared to those who did not, were chosen more often to give their contact information and were rated as being more sexually attractive. Another study found that negotiators who mirrored others&#x2019; behavior were more likely to reach a deal than those who did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_73">Maddux, Mullen, &#x0026; Galinsky, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, it may also be the case that mimicking another person&#x2019;s behavior makes us more susceptible to that person&#x2019;s persuasive attempts. In one study, for example, people who mimicked the movements of a person presenting a product had more intention to buy the product than people who did not mimic the person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_114">Stel, Mastop, &#x0026; Strick, 2011</xref>). Another study showed that people who had been mimicked were more helpful and generous than those who had not been (van Baaren, Holland, Kawakami, &#x0026; van <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_126">Knippenberg, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_189">189</target>From the Neck Down: Persuasion and Body Language</title>
<p>Some of the principles of persuasion that we discussed in relation to the eyes and the face also apply to communication with the body. For example, just as you can mirror a person&#x2019;s facial expressions, you can mirror his or her gestures and body movements. Moreover, consistent with the direct effects model of immediacy (discussed previously), people who lean forward when communicating tend to be more persuasive than those who do not. In addition to these findings, research shows that people are more persuasive when they are pictured using open body positions (i.e., when their arms and legs are positioned away from their bodies) rather than neutral or closed positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_80">McGinley, LeFevre, &#x0026; McGinley, 1975</xref>). (Did you know that the way you move your body may also make you safer? See <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box8_2">Box 8.2</xref>.)</p>
<p>Perhaps most of the research on body movement and persuasion, however, has focused on the use of gestures. Although various researchers have discussed a number of different gestures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_5">Argyle (1988)</xref> argued that it is most useful to focus on three: emblems, illustrators, and self-touching.</p>
<sec id="sec8_2_1_3_1">
<title>Emblems</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_28">Ekman and Friesen (1969)</xref>, <italic>emblems</italic> are nonverbal behaviors, usually hand movements, that have precise verbal meaning. Thus, emblems can substitute for words. Traffic cops, referees, baseball catchers, and scuba divers are well-known emblem users, but we all use them. Think of all the words for which we have gestures: <target target-type="page" id="page_190">190</target>hello, good-bye, come here, crazy, quiet or shush, peace, I don&#x2019;t know, good luck, think, and shame on you, not to mention the ever-popular middle finger gesture.</p>

<caption><title>Walk This Way: Are You Vulnerable to Attack?</title></caption>
<p>From an early age, you were probably instructed to use crosswalks, to look both ways before crossing the street, and to walk rather than run around swimming pools. But did you know that walking safely might also depend on how you carry yourself? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_49">Gunns, Johnston, and Hudson (2002)</xref>, victims of attack are not chosen randomly. These researchers suggest that, in the same way that vulnerable sheep in a herd are identified, isolated, and pounced on by wolves, some people, by virtue of their gait, may appear more vulnerable to would-be attackers. Consistent with this notion, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_132">Wheeler, Book, and Costello (2009)</xref> found that males with higher psychopathic scores were better able to distinguish people who had been victimized from those who had not after viewing short video clips of those people walking. To shed light on the characteristics of different walking styles, Gunns and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_49">2002</xref>) asked 30 males and 30 females to watch videotapes of more than 100 male and female walkers while rating how vulnerable to attack the walkers seemed. Analysis of the ratings and videotapes revealed that the typical &#x201C;hard to attack&#x201D; walker was characterized by a longer stride, a larger range of arm swing, higher energy, lower constraint, and a faster walk. Before concluding this segment, we want to be clear, as Wheeler and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_132">2009</xref>) were, that people are not responsible for victimization because of how they walk. The attacker is always to blame. That said, knowing what perpetrators look for is a weapon you can use to defend yourself. In short, to appear less vulnerable, put some pep in your step!!!</p>

<p>Emblems are an important part of communication and serve many functions, persuasion included. But what part do emblems play in social influence? Several scholars have argued that a prerequisite for persuasion is attention to and retention of a message (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_81">McGuire, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_95">Petty &#x0026; Cacioppo, 1986</xref>), and it seems that by providing more visual information, emblems play a large role in fostering attention and retention in persuadees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_135">Woodall and Folger (1981)</xref>, for example, found that people recalled 34 percent of a verbal message when it was accompanied by an emblem compared to only 11 percent when other types of gestures were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8_2_1_3_2">
<title>Illustrators</title>
<p>Although emblems have meaning independent of verbal communication, <italic>illustrators,</italic> a second type of gesture, accompany speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_28">Ekman &#x0026; Friesen, 1969</xref>). Like their name implies, illustrators illustrate, emphasize, or repeat what is being said. A child saying she loves you &#x201C;this much&#x201D; while spreading her arms wide is using an illustrator. Likewise, we can use illustrators to give directions, show our excitement, follow a rhythm, demonstrate a shape, and so forth.</p>
<p>Several studies indicate that the use of illustrators increases a speaker&#x2019;s persuasiveness. In one study, for instance, actors who used more forceful and rhythmic gestures were more persuasive than those who did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_78">Maslow, Yoselson, &#x0026; London, 1971</xref>). In addition, some illustrators make speakers appear more effective and composed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_74">Maricchiolo, Gnisci, Bonaiuto, &#x0026; Ficca, 2009</xref>), which doesn&#x2019;t hurt when you are trying to be persuasive.</p>

<title>Self-Touching Behaviors (Adaptors)</title>
<p>Although emblems and illustrators seem to increase people&#x2019;s persuasiveness, the jury is still out on the effect of <italic>self-touching behaviors</italic> (e.g., scratching your arm, rubbing your cheek, picking your nose, stroking your hair), also known as <italic>adaptors</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_28">Ekman &#x0026; Friesen, 1969</xref>). For example, while some research suggests that the use of adaptors was associated with less persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_78">Maslow et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_82">Mehrabian &#x0026; Williams, 1969</xref>), other research shows the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_74">Maricchiolo et al., 2009</xref>). Even so, most research agrees that self-touching behaviors are often seen as a sign of anxiety and lack of composure (unless, perhaps, you are Britney Spears or Madonna). With that <target target-type="page" id="page_191">191</target>in mind, our best advice at this point is to avoid using adaptors if you want to be persuasive.</p>

Many years ago, three researchers interested in the topic of <italic>haptics</italic> (or touch) conducted a simple yet classic study to explore this question. In the study, library clerks did one of two things when they handed library cards back to university students who were checking out books: Either they did not touch the students or they made light physical contact by placing a hand over the students&#x2019; palms. After their cards were returned, students were asked to rate the quality of the library, and, interestingly, those who were touched evaluated the library much more favorably than those who were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_30">Fisher, Rytting, &#x0026; Heslin, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>The persuasive impact of touch has been demonstrated in other contexts as well. For example, touch has been found to increase the number of people who volunteered to score papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_89">Patterson, Powell, &#x0026; Lenihan, 1986</xref>), sign petitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_133">Willis &#x0026; Hamm, 1980</xref>), complete questionnaires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_125">Vaidis &#x0026; Halimi-Falkowicz, 2008</xref>), return money that had been left in a telephone booth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_64">Kleinke, 1977</xref>), accept invitations to dance in nightclubs (Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_37">2007</xref>), provide phone numbers to prospective dating partners (Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_37">2007</xref>), and help someone pick up items that had been dropped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_42">Gu&#x00E9;guen &#x0026; Fischer-Lokou, 2003</xref>). Similarly, when food servers touch diners appropriately, the servers earn higher tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_55">Hornick, 1992</xref>), and the diners are more likely to take servers&#x2019; recommendations about what to order (Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_47">Jacob, &#x0026; Boulbry, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_55">Hornick (1992)</xref> found that touching bookstore customers on the arm caused them to shop longer (22.11 minutes versus 13.56 minutes), purchase more (&#x0024;15.03 versus &#x0024;12.23), and evaluate the store more positively than customers who had not been touched. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_55">Hornick (1992)</xref> also found that supermarket customers who had been touched were more likely to taste and purchase food samples than untouched customers.</p>
<p>One common way of touching people is through handshakes, and, as it turns out, the way you shake hands may influence the impressions people form of you. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_9">Bernieri and Petty (2011)</xref> found that people make judgments about whether others are conscientious and extroverted on the basis of handshakes. Not only that, the way you shake hands might help you get a job. Specifically, in one study, men and women who used desirable handshakes (i.e., firm clasps with a full grip while looking the other person in the eye) received higher ratings of employment suitability from interviewers than did men and women with less desirable, limp-fishy types of handshakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_116">Stewart, Dustin, Barrick, &#x0026; Darnold, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering this research, it seems, then, that all the stuff we learned as kids about &#x201C;the Midas touch&#x201D; may not be such a fairytale. Touching people, when done appropriately, seems to be persuasive. Touch may put people in a good mood, making them more likely to comply with requests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_55">Hornick, 1992</xref>). Another explanation is that people who touch create more favorable impressions of themselves and, therefore, are more persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_55">Hornick, 1992</xref>). Finally, people who touch may be more persuasive because, through touch, they augment their image of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_89">Patterson et al., 1986</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>If It Feels Good, Buy It: The Role of Touching Merchandise on Persuasion</title></caption>
<p>When you are shopping, do you find yourself picking things up, feeling the texture of fabrics, and running your fingers over merchandise? If so, you may be what researchers have called high in the need for touch (NFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_90">Peck &#x0026; Childers, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_91">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_93">Peck &#x0026; Wiggins, 2005</xref>). High NFTs get frustrated while shopping if they cannot touch things. Not all NFTs are the same, however. Some, called instrumental NFTs, use touch to evaluate products, while others, called autotelic NFTs, touch things because it is fun and pleasurable for them. With that in mind, autotelic NFTs are persuaded when there are pleasurable things to touch, even when those things are not relevant to what is being marketed (e.g., soft swatches of fabric on a pamphlet seeking donations for a nature center) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_93">Peck &#x0026; Wiggins, 2005</xref>) and regardless of whether they are involved in the issue being considered or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_92">Peck &#x0026; Johnson, 2011</xref>). Instrumental NFTs, however, are persuaded only when what is being touched is relevant to what is being marketed (e.g., feathers and tree bark samples on a pamphlet seeking donations for a nature center) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_93">Peck &#x0026; Wiggins, 2005</xref>), and when their involvement in the issue is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_92">Peck &#x0026; Johnson, 2011</xref>).</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Whatever the reason for the persuasive impact of touch, one thing is clear: The use of touch for persuasive purposes is tricky because touch is so ambiguous. What one person may see as &#x201C;warm,&#x201D; for example, another may view as a &#x201C;power play.&#x201D; In fact, one study found that in competitive contexts, touching another person led to decreased cooperation, perhaps because it is perceived as an attempt to dominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_25">Camps, Tuteleers, Stouten, &#x0026; Nelissen, 2013</xref>). What&#x2019;s more, what one person might interpret as &#x201C;friendly,&#x201D; another may see as &#x201C;flirtatious.&#x201D; The &#x201C;brushing&#x201D; of one employee against another could be interpreted as accidental or as a form of sexual harassment. Clearly, interpretations of touch depend on a vast array of factors, including context, gender, and culture. In most of the studies we&#x2019;ve just discussed, touching generally occurred on the hands or arms. We suspect that too much touching or touching other parts of a person might actually backfire, making persuasion less likely. As potential persuadees, it is important to realize that even touches, such as those enacted in most of the studies we discussed, wield tremendous persuasive power. Such touches may be so subtle that we might not even be aware that they are being used for persuasive purposes. But do not be fooled. Touch is persuasive, as is the use of space&#x2014;our next topic. (For more on the persuasive effects of touch, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box8_3">Box 8.3</xref>.)</p>

<title>Keep Your Distance? Proxemics and Persuasion</title>
<p>The study of <italic>proxemics,</italic> or how we use space to communicate, covers a variety of topics, such as territoriality and dominance. In this chapter, however, we are less concerned with those topics and, instead, focus our discussion on the concept of <italic>personal space,</italic> which refers to what might be considered an invisible bubble that surrounds us. An obvious case in point is that a door-to-door salesperson should not <target target-type="page" id="page_193">193</target>stick his or her nose in a potential customer&#x2019;s face. However, there is some evidence that indicates that the opposite is the case: That is, violating a person&#x2019;s space may be more persuasive.</p>
<p>In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_8">Baron and Bell (1976)</xref>, for instance, diners in a cafeteria were approached by an experimenter and asked to volunteer for a survey for a period of 30 minutes to 2 hours and 30 minutes. The experimenter stood close to some diners (12&#x2013;18 in.) and farther away from others (3&#x2013;4 ft). Results of the study showed that diners volunteered to participate for longer periods of time when they were approached at closer distances.</p>
<p>How can we explain this finding? First, because people tend to stand closer to people they like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_5">Argyle, 1988</xref>), persuadees may simply be reciprocating the liking by complying with the violator&#x2019;s requests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_8">Baron &#x0026; Bell, 1976</xref>). In addition, because people find spatial invasion uncomfortable, those invaded may perceive persuaders as more demanding, desperate, and needful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_8">Baron &#x0026; Bell, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>As with other forms of nonverbal communication, some caution is advised when making generalizations about the role of proxemics in persuasion. Indeed, at least two studies indicate that closer distances may not encourage compliance. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_111">Smith and Knowles (1979)</xref> found that pedestrians who had their space invaded without justification were less likely to return a lost object than those who had not had their space invaded. Moreover, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_1">Albert and Dabbs (1970)</xref> found that speakers were more persuasive the farther they were from other people (i.e., speakers were more persuasive when standing 4&#x2013;5 or 14&#x2013;15 ft from their audiences than they were when standing 1&#x2013;2 ft from their audiences).</p>
<p>If the conflicting results of these studies seem confusing, you might be interested in a theory presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_20">Judee Burgoon (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_21">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_22">1994</xref>). It is called <italic>expectancy violations theory,</italic> and we think it provides a strong and elegant explanation for the ways in which space violations affect the process of social influence.</p>
<p>According to the theory, we all have expectations about how close other people should stand to us. When people violate those expectations and get either too close or too far away, we experience arousal and may become distracted. How we react to the violation, however, depends on several factors, perhaps the most important being the &#x201C;reward value&#x201D; of the violator. If he or she is attractive, has the power to reward or punish us, or is just plain likable, the violation is perceived as a pleasant surprise, and we are more likely to be persuaded. However, if the violator has low reward value, the violation will be perceived as negative, and compliance will be less likely. In addition, the theory states that if violations are so extreme that they are perceived as threatening, they also will decrease compliance.</p>
<p>The theory has received a considerable amount of support and implies several practical suggestions for those interested in persuading others. First, if you think the person you are trying to persuade sees you as attractive, powerful, or credible, it is best to stand a little farther or a little closer to that person than would be expected. Second, if you think you are perceived by someone as powerless and icky, you should maintain appropriate distances. Finally, never overdo it. If you stand too close or too far away, you will probably not be persuasive.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_194">194</target>Chronemics: All Good Things to Those Who Wait?</title>
<p>In science, the concepts of space and time are often discussed together. However, in the study of persuasion, although considerable research has examined the topic of proxemics, little attention has been paid to <italic>chronemics,</italic> or the study of how time is used to communicate. Even so, we know that time can be an important commodity, especially in a culture like the United States.</p>
<p>A common expression in the military, especially among soldiers with lower ranks, is &#x201C;hurry up and wait.&#x201D; Oftentimes, it seems that such soldiers are expected to be on time although their superiors can show up whenever they want to. The point is, the higher your status, the more power you have over other people&#x2019;s time.</p>
<p>This is true in other contexts as well. For instance, how much time have you spent waiting in doctors&#x2019; offices? Do you have to make appointments to see some professors or to get interviewed for a job? And don&#x2019;t be fooled: If you are a subordinate and show up more than a few minutes late to a business meeting, do you think you&#x2019;ll be very persuasive? We suspect not.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, then, you might be wondering whether it is okay to be late if you have a lot of status. Our suggestion is &#x201C;be careful.&#x201D; Indeed, a study mentioned in the work of Burgoon and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_23">1996</xref>) found that people who arrive 15 minutes late are considered dynamic, but much less competent, composed, and sociable than people who arrive on time. Plus, we think making people wait is rude.</p>
<p>Time not only affects perceptions of people but it also can be used as a persuasive ploy. For instance, for people in a hurry, drive-through banking or fast-food restaurants may have appeal, as may establishments such as Jiffy Lube, LensCrafters, and 1-Hour Photo. When such services save you time, it&#x2019;s terrific. But beware. Just because an exercise video promises to transform your buns into steel in only three minutes a day, or a flyer claims you can earn &#x0024;60,000 a year working at home in your spare time, or an audiotape claims it will teach you how to play guitar in two weeks doesn&#x2019;t mean that will really happen. Too often, people seek quick solutions to complicated problems. We want to buy a product, take a pill, or push a button, and make a problem go away. Persuaders prey on this quick-fix mentality.</p>
<p>In addition to ploys offering to save time, sometimes strategies are based on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_26">Cialdini (1993)</xref> calls the principle of <italic>scarcity.</italic> According to Cialdini and others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_13">Brehm, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_14">Brehm &#x0026; Brehm, 1981</xref>), people love freedom, and when that freedom is threatened or limited, people experience something called <italic>psychological reactance</italic>, a concept we introduced in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter3">Chapter 3</xref>. For example, a shopper in a store may decide she likes a certain dress. If a salesperson explains to the customer that there is only one more dress like that in her size (i.e., the dress is <italic>scarce</italic>), the woman, who might have thought that she was free to buy the dress at any time, may now <italic>react psychologically</italic> by wanting the dress more than she did in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_26">Cialdini, 1993</xref>). As you well know, persuaders also attempt to use psychological reactance in their favor by making time scarce. For instance, by telling us that we must &#x201C;act now&#x201D; or that there is a &#x201C;limited time offer,&#x201D; advertisers are relying on the principle of scarcity. By limiting our time, they hope to make us more likely to purchase their product or service.</p>
<p>The notion that &#x201C;time is running out&#x201D; has the potential to nudge us in other ways as well. For example, one of our favorite vintage studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_94">Pennebaker et al., 1979</xref>) <target target-type="page" id="page_195">195</target>tested country singer Mickey Gilley&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_33">1975</xref>) prediction that &#x201C;the girls get prettier at closing time&#x201D; by asking bar patrons to rate the attractiveness of other patrons during various times in the evening. Results indicated that ratings of opposite-sex patrons increased near closing time, suggesting that people&#x2019;s standards change as the pickin&#x2019;s get slim (i.e., as time and potential partners become scarce). A recent replication of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_58">Johnco, Wheeler, &#x0026; Taylor, 2010</xref>) suggests that, although these results are due, in part, to alcohol consumption (known in popular culture as the &#x201C;beer goggles&#x201D; effect), scarcity remains a viable explanation for why people&#x2019;s standards for attractiveness change over time. Of course, if you haven&#x2019;t hooked up with a &#x201C;10&#x201D; by last call, you can always settle for two &#x201C;5&#x2019;s.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Interestingly, perhaps because the psychological pressure created by scarcity is so uncomfortable, some persuaders have found that a &#x201C;nonurgency&#x201D; tactic is preferable. In other words, because people don&#x2019;t want to be rushed and pressured, sometimes coming across as if time is <italic>not</italic> an issue can be very persuasive. Starbucks and other coffee houses that offer free Wi-Fi encourage customers to stay. &#x201C;No, no, no&#x201D; sales also use this approach: A consumer buys a mattress, a big-screen TV, or an appliance and pays no money down, no interest, and no monthly payments until anywhere from 90 days to a year later. Products or services that advertise a &#x201C;free 30-day trial offer&#x201D; also facilitate sales by removing time pressures.</p>
<p>Finally, if customers get tired of waiting, there might be a creative solution. Consider, for example, how executives at a Houston airport responded when they got swamped with complaints about the long waits at baggage claim. Instead of reducing wait times, the executives routed flights to distant arrival gates, thereby forcing passengers to walk longer distances. As a result of keeping passengers busy, complaints virtually disappeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_117">Stone, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Artifacts and Physical Features of the Environment: Dress for Success</title>
<p>While talking about the notion of time, did we mention that an expensive watch with a gold wristband couldn&#x2019;t hurt your image much? Obviously, the clothes and makeup we wear, the cars we drive, the furniture we own, and other physical objects, also known as <italic>artifacts,</italic> can communicate a great deal about our credibility and status. In our society, material goods are viewed as an extension of oneself. Why else would color analysts be getting rich by telling people whether to wear summer, autumn, winter, or spring colored makeup? And why else would someone pay thousands of dollars for an Armani suit?</p>
<p>Speaking of suits, we know a good story about how artifacts can affect people&#x2019;s perceptions. Many years ago, one of the authors sold men&#x2019;s suits for commission. Because he obviously did not earn anything unless he sold merchandise, when given a choice, the author tried to help customers who appeared as if they would spend a lot of money. One day a customer entered the store wearing a greasy T-shirt, jeans, no socks, and filthy tennis shoes. Because at the time there were plenty of other people shopping, the author decided to pick a more &#x201C;profitable-looking&#x201D; customer on whom to wait. One of the new employees, however, decided to help the &#x201C;greaseball.&#x201D; Much to the author&#x2019;s surprise, however, that greaseball ended up buying six very expensive suits. It turned out he was not a greaseball at all; he was a high-paid <target target-type="page" id="page_196">196</target>executive who had just lost all of his suits in a fire. He was restocking his wardrobe. Of course, the old saying &#x201C;you can&#x2019;t judge a book by its cover&#x201D; took on a whole new meaning that day.</p>

<p>Apparently, when it comes to making quick judgments like this, the author is not alone. Indeed, previous literature suggests that first impressions are not only powerful and enduring, they are often based on seemingly trivial appearance cues (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_23">Burgoon, Buller, &#x0026; Woodall, 1996</xref>). Research indicates, for example, that cues such as clothing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_36">Gorham, Cohen, &#x0026; Morris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_104">Seiter &#x0026; Dunn, 2000</xref>), grooming (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_6">Atkins &#x0026; Kent, 1988</xref>), cosmetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_59">Johnson &#x0026; Workman, 1991</xref>), hair length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_6">Atkins &#x0026; Kent, 1988</xref>), tattooing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_105">Seiter &#x0026; Hatch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_119">Swami &#x0026; Furnham, 2007</xref>), and body piercing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_106">Seiter &#x0026; Sandry, 2003</xref>) influence judgments about credibility, attractiveness, and whether or not to hire someone. In other words, if anything, such research indicates that such cues are not trivial at all and, in some contexts (e.g., when interviewing), may be more important than verbal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_35">Goldberg &#x0026; Cohen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to those discussed, other artifacts and features of the environment can be influential. For instance, power and status might be communicated through the size and location of a person&#x2019;s office. Large offices in corner spaces, for example, are often considered prestigious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_2">Andersen, 1999</xref>). Not only that, one of our favorite studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_123">Teven &#x0026; Comadena, 1996</xref>) illustrates that an office&#x2019;s appearance may be important as well. In the study, 97 students went one at a time to meet a professor in his office. On arriving for the meeting, however, they found no professor and were asked to wait 5 minutes for him. Some of the students waited in a disorganized and untidy office, <target target-type="page" id="page_197">197</target>whereas others waited in a clean and neatly arranged office. After the 5 minutes were up, the students were told that the professor could not make the meeting. Later, however, they saw the professor lecture and rated him on several scales. The results of the study showed that the professor&#x2019;s office had a significant influence on students&#x2019; perceptions. Specifically, compared to students who visited the tidy office, those who visited the untidy one perceived the professor as less authoritative, less trustworthy, less open, less relaxed, less concerned about making a good impression, less animated, and less friendly. Interestingly, however, the &#x201C;untidy&#x201D; professor was seen as the most dynamic, perhaps because the disheveled office created the impression of a busy and energetic person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_123">Teven &#x0026; Comadena, 1996</xref>). Whatever the case, after reading this study, we&#x2019;ll be straightening up.</p>
<p>And apparently, we&#x2019;re not the only ones. Other people know about the importance of structuring the environment. For example, if you&#x2019;re thinking of buying a house, before you do, remember that those dandy model homes may not look the same once you&#x2019;re living in them. Why not? The furniture is downsized to make the rooms look larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_75">Martin, 2000</xref>). Plus, empty closets, refrigerators without kiddie art, and the absence of other household necessities make such homes look tidy and ever so inviting. The practice of &#x201C;staging&#x201D; homes by using decluttering and inexpensive improvements is now a big business.</p>
<p>Supermarkets are another example of how environments are arranged strategically (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_29">Field, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_84">Meyer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_120">Tandingan, 2001</xref>). Next time you&#x2019;re shopping, for instance, take a look around. You might notice that staples such as dairy, meat, and produce are in the back or on opposite sides of the store. Why? It forces shoppers to meander through the aisles where they&#x2019;ll be tempted to buy all kinds of other goodies. You&#x2019;ll also notice that chips, dips, and other products that &#x201C;go together&#x201D; are intentionally placed side by side, encouraging additional purchases. And it&#x2019;s no accident that children&#x2019;s products (e.g., Cap&#x2019;n Crunch) are often placed on middle shelves so that they are at eye level to little precious who is seated in the shopping cart, whereas adult products (e.g., Grape Nuts) are at higher elevations. What&#x2019;s more, snack foods, which appeal to impulsive shoppers, are often located in checkout areas and at the ends of aisles where they&#x2019;re more likely to be snatched up. Clearly, such placement is adapted to particular audiences and aimed at making products noticeable to consumers.</p>
<p>In addition to the studies and tactics we&#x2019;ve mentioned so far, considerable evidence shows that artifacts and physical features of the environment can not only make products more noticeable and people appear more (or less) credible, they can also lead to persuasion. Most of this research has focused on the impact of clothing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_70">Lawrence and Watson (1991)</xref>, for example, found that individuals asking for contributions to law enforcement and health-care campaigns earned more money when wearing sheriffs&#x2019; and nurses&#x2019; uniforms than when they did not. In another classic study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_11">Bickman (1974)</xref> had young men dressed as either civilians or uniformed guards, approach pedestrians on the streets of New York and ask them to do one of three things. In one situation, pedestrians were shown a bag lying on the ground and were told, &#x201C;Pick up this bag for me!&#x201D; In another condition, the experimenter pointed at a man standing near a parked car and said, &#x201C;This fellow is over-parked at the meter but doesn&#x2019;t have any change. Give him a dime!&#x201D; In the final condition, a person standing at a bus stop was told, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you know you have to stand on the other side of the <target target-type="page" id="page_198">198</target>pole? The sign says, &#x2018;No Standing.&#x2019;&#x201D; Results of the study showed that, in all three conditions, people complied more with the guard than they did with the civilians. In other words, something about a uniform tends to make us obedient.</p>
<p>Although meta-analyses indicate that fancy suits, uniforms, and high-status clothing are related to higher rates of compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_100">Segrin, 1993</xref>), such apparel might not always be necessary for persuasion. In some cases, it may also be possible to influence people by wearing clothing that makes them identify with a persuader. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_51">Hensley (1981)</xref>, for instance, found that well-dressed people were more persuasive in airports, but casually dressed people were more persuasive at bus stops.</p>
<p>In short, it appears that artifacts, particularly clothing, make a difference when trying to seek compliance. Of course, artifacts can also affect your appearance or attractiveness, which, in turn, can affect your persuasiveness. We now turn our discussion to this topic.</p>

<title>Physical Appearance: Of Beauties and Beasts</title>
<p>Beauty may only be skin deep, but it is persuasive. And the people out there trying to influence us know this. Beauty sells. For example, if Gisele B&#x00FC;ndchen had a big nose and warts with hair growing out of them, do you think you&#x2019;d have seen her face spread across the pages of makeup and lingerie ads? It seems, in fact, that the products being endorsed by attractive spokespersons do not even have to be connected with making us more attractive. Indeed, beautiful people are trying to sell us everything from milk, to law firms, to dog food.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, plenty of research indicates that physical attractiveness is persuasive in contexts other than advertising (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box8_4">Box 8.4</xref>). For instance, compared to their less-attractive counterparts, attractive people are judged to be happier, more <target target-type="page" id="page_199">199</target>intelligent, friendlier, stronger, and kinder and are thought to have better personalities, better jobs, and greater marital competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_66">Knapp, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_104">Seiter and Dunn (2000)</xref> found that it did not matter whether a woman was made to appear attractive in a pristine way (e.g., conservative clothing, makeup, and jewelry) or attractive in a sexy way (e.g., revealing clothes, heavy makeup). In both cases, she was believed more when claiming to have been sexually harassed than when she was made to appear unattractive (e.g., blotchy skin, greasy hair, no makeup). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_88">Palmer and Peterson (2016)</xref> found that, when talking politics, attractive people (particularly poorly informed ones), are more likely than unattractive people to try persuading others. Not only that, they&#x2019;re perceived as better informed and more persuasive than unattractive people.</p>

<caption><title>Hot by Association: How Facebook Friends Affect Your Attractiveness</title></caption>
<p>If you are one of the millions of people who use the social networking website Facebook, you might be interested to know that people may be judging you by the company you keep. It has been known for some time that judgments of attractiveness are relative. For example, when photos of average-looking people are shown beside photos of attractive and unattractive people, a contrast effect occurs: Average people are seen as more attractive when seen alongside unattractive people and less attractive when seen alongside attractive people. If, however, the people judging attractiveness are told that a relationship exists between the people in the photos, the opposite effect (assimilation) occurs: Average people are now seen as less attractive when paired with unattractive people and more attractive when paired with attractive people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_83">Melamed &#x0026; Moss, 1975</xref>). Knowing this, it probably won&#x2019;t surprise you to learn that, if you want to appear &#x201C;hotter,&#x201D; it helps to have attractive friends on Facebook. Indeed, two studies found that Facebook users were perceived as more physically and socially attractive when they were associated with good-looking pals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_57">Jaschinski &#x0026; Kommers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_128">Walther, Van Der Heide, Kim, Westerman, &#x0026; Tong, 2008</xref>).</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_88">Palmer and Peterson (2016)</xref>, these results may be due to a &#x201C;halo effect,&#x201D; in which one positive characteristic of a person causes us to see everything about the person in a positive light. In other words, if the person is attractive, he or she must also be trustworthy, well informed, and so forth. Whatever the case, given the preceding findings, perhaps you are wondering what physical characteristics are related to attractiveness. Although we know that standards for beauty change over time (e.g., did you know that, in medieval times, pale and plump people were perceived as the most attractive?) and that beauty is supposedly in the eye of the beholder, research tells us that some of the following characteristics are related to perceptions and/or persuasiveness:</p>
<p>1. <italic>Body shape</italic>: Dwayne &#x201C;The Rock&#x201D; Johnson, Taylor Swift, and Jonah Hill represent the three basic body shapes. The first, a <italic>mesomorph,</italic> is muscular; the second, an <italic>ectomorph</italic> is thin; and the third, an <italic>endomorph,</italic> is round. Findings summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_5">Argyle (1988)</xref> show that whereas mesomorphs are rated as, among other things, strong and adventurous, ectomorphs are seen as tense, pessimistic, and quiet, and <target target-type="page" id="page_200">200</target>endomorphs are seen as warm, sympathetic, agreeable, and dependent. Because of negative stereotypes, endomorphs tend to be perceived as less powerful, successful, attractive, and enthusiastic than those with different body shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_15">Breseman, Lennon, &#x0026; Schulz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_127">Wade, Fuller, Bresnan, Schaefer, &#x0026; Mlynarski, 2007</xref>). Moreover, endomorphs are less likely to get jobs, less likely to earn high salaries, and less likely to be accepted into colleges than thinner people with the same IQs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_5">Argyle, 1988</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Even so, one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_76">Martins, Pliner, &#x0026; Lee, 2004</xref>) indicated that perceptions based on body shape depend on other factors, specifically meal size. In the study, Canadian students reported their impressions of normal or overweight males and females who were portrayed as eating small or large meals. Overweight males eating large meals were perceived by all students as the least socially attractive, perhaps because they are thought to lack self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_76">Martins et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, however, while female students perceived normal-weight females who ate small meals as the most socially attractive, male students rated normal-weight females who ate large meals as the most socially attractive. Why? The researchers suggested that males may perceive normal-weight females who eat heartily as more comfortable with themselves, more confident, and more honest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_76">Martins et al., 2004</xref>). That being said, women may face a double standard when it comes to weight. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_61">Judge and Cable (2011)</xref>, for example, found that thin women earned significantly higher salaries than middleweight women, while thin men earned lower salaries than middleweight men. Being obese negatively affected the salaries of both men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_61">Judge &#x0026; Cable, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>2. <italic>Facial appearance</italic></bold>: According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_5">Argyle (1988)</xref>, faces are perceived as more attractive when they have wide cheekbones, narrow cheeks, high eyebrows, wide pupils, large smiles, noses that are not too long or too short, and eyes not too far apart or too close together. Baby-faced women are perceived as more attractive but immature by men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_10">Berry &#x0026; McArthur, 1986</xref>) and, whereas baby-faced people are cast into commercials that want to portray trustworthiness, mature-faced people are cast into commercials that want to emphasize expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_18">Brownlow &#x0026; Zebrowitz, 1990</xref>). Interestingly, because baby-faced speakers may look more honest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_77">Masip, Garrido, &#x0026; Herrero, 2004</xref>), they are more persuasive when their trustworthiness is questioned, while mature-faced speakers are more persuasive when their expertise is questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_17">Brownlow, 1992</xref>). In addition, while being baby-faced seems to benefit female politicians, it works to male politicians&#x2019; disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_72">Lee, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>That said, the most persuasive faces, perhaps, are ones that remind us of ourselves. Indeed, in one of our favorite studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_96">Richards &#x0026; Hample, 2016</xref>), research participants saw photographs of a speaker. Unbeknown to the participants, the speaker&#x2019;s face was actually a composite of two faces that had been digitally morphed together. What&#x2019;s more, while some participants saw photos that merged the faces of two strangers, others saw photos that merged their own face with a stranger&#x2019;s. Compared to the first group of participants, those in the second group perceived the speaker to be more likable, credible, and persuasive. Why? According to the researchers, evolution benefits people who give preferential treatment to their kin. See the connection? People who look like us may be genetically similar. As such, we&#x2019;re prone to prefer them over dissimilar others, a concept known <italic>nepotistic altruism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_50">Hamilton, 1964</xref>).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_201">201</target><bold>3. <italic>Hair</italic></bold>: Do blondes, as the old saying goes, &#x201C;have more fun?&#x201D; We&#x2019;re not sure about that, but when it comes to another old saying&#x2014;&#x201C;Gentlemen prefer blondes&#x201D;&#x2014; research seems to agree. Indeed, in several studies the same women sported different hair colors, and, generally speaking, were favored by males when posing as blondes. By way of example, blonde hitchhikers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_38">Gu&#x00E9;guen &#x0026; Lamy, 2009</xref>), waitresses (Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_40">2012b</xref>), and night clubbers (Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_39">2012a</xref>) received more rides, tips, and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_118">Swami &#x0026; Barrett, 2011</xref>, Study 1), respectively. On the other hand, although blondes received more help (Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_41">2012c</xref>) and were rated as more attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_113">Sorokowski, 2008</xref>), they were also perceived as more needy and less competent than brunettes (Swami &#x0026; Barrett, Study 2).</p>
<p>That said, research shows that hair of any color may be better than no hair at all. For instance, a study comparing hair loss among male governors and members of Congress to the general public found that elected politicians are more likely to have a full head of hair than would be expected of men their age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_109">Sigelman, Dawson, Nitz, &#x0026; Whicker, 1990</xref>). Before you conclude that more hair means more persuasion, however, consider a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_48">Guido, Peluso, and Moffa (2011)</xref>, which examined the persuasive effects of beards. Based on research suggesting that men with beards tend to be perceived as less attractive but more trustworthy and competent than men with no facial hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_27">De Souza, Bai&#x00E3;o, &#x0026; Otta, 2003</xref>), these researchers found that cleanshaven men were more persuasive when endorsing products related to attractiveness (i.e., underwear), while bearded guys were more persuasive when endorsing products related to trustworthiness and expertise (i.e., cellphones and toothpaste). Such research supports the <italic>match-up hypothesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_63">Kamins, 1990</xref>), which argues that persuasion is increased when endorsers are paired with products that emphasize characteristics of the endorsers.</p>
<p><bold>4. <italic>Height</italic></bold>: According to a meta-analysis of 45 studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_60">Judge &#x0026; Cable, 2004</xref>), when it comes to a person&#x2019;s height, size matters. The analysis found that being taller, especially if you are male, is positively associated with ratings of leadership, performance, and social esteem. Not only that, the study reported that taller people earn significantly more money in their careers than do their shorter counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_60">Judge &#x0026; Cable, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Paralinguistics and Persuasion: Pump Up the Volume?</title>
<p><italic>Paralinguistics,</italic> or <italic>vocalics,</italic> is the study of vocal stimuli aside from spoken words. It includes such elements as pitch, rate, pauses, volume, tone of voice, silences, laughs, screams, sighs, and so forth. We know from prior research that the <italic>way</italic> in which persons speak affects how they are perceived as well as their ability to persuade. In one study, for instance, people who listened to high-pitched voices perceived the speaker as more attractive and extroverted than those who listened to low-pitched voices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_56">Imhof, 2010</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_54">Hinkle (2001)</xref> found that when managers spoke clearly and varied their tone, employees tended to like them better.</p>
<p>More recently, researchers have identified a quality of voice known as <italic>vocal fry</italic> or &#x201C;creaky voice,&#x201D; which is characterized by drawing out the end of sentences with a low, croaking growl in the back of the throat (to hear it, Google &#x201C;vocal fry&#x201D; or think Britney Spears, Kim Kardashian, or Matthew McConaughey). <target target-type="page" id="page_202">202</target>According to Anderson and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_4">2014</xref>), vocal fry is increasingly common among young American females, and leads them, more so than males, to be perceived as less competent, less trustworthy, less attractive, and less hirable. Such findings suggest that women&#x2019;s voices may be subject to more criticism than men&#x2019;s, a double standard if you ask us.</p>
<p>In addition to pitch and quality, researchers have examined the effects of speaking rate. Previous studies, for example, indicate that faster speakers are perceived as more credible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_110">Simonds, Meyer, Quinlan, &#x0026; Hunt, 2006</xref>) and persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_85">Miller, Maruyama, Beaber, &#x0026; Valone, 1976</xref>) than those who speak slower, perhaps because they appear more competent and knowledgeable. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_19">Buller and Aune (1988)</xref> found that for persuasion to occur, the optimal rate of speech may depend on both the encoding ability of the sender and the decoding ability of the receiver. Specifically, although good decoders were more likely to comply with speeches delivered at fast rates, poor decoders preferred slower rates. In a related study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_112">Smith and Shaffer (1995)</xref> found that speeches delivered at faster rates hinder people&#x2019;s ability to scrutinize messages. Thus, consistent with the elaboration likelihood model (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter2">Chapter 2</xref>), people who heard a speech delivered at a normal speed were persuaded when the speech contained strong arguments, whereas those who heard accelerated speeches were persuaded equally by strong and weak messages. That said, if you&#x2019;re at all like us, you&#x2019;ve undoubtedly heard that old stereotype about &#x201C;fasttalking&#x201D; salespeople. You can&#x2019;t trust them, right? We&#x2019;re not sure about that, but one study found that those end-of-commercial disclaimers are less persuasive when delivered at fast-paced rather than normal-paced speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_52">Herbst, Finkel, Allan, &#x0026; Fitzsimons, 2012</xref>). If you ask us, they&#x2019;re also pretty irritating.</p>
<p>Finally, you might be interested to know that not all studies on vocalics focus exclusively on human speech. Indeed, for those of you who&#x2019;ve been unfortunate enough to answer your telephone and find one of those eerie computer-synthesized voices selling some product on the other end, here&#x2019;s an interesting study. The study asked people to listen to persuasive messages spoken by either a natural human voice or a synthetic computerized voice and then measured how persuaded the people were. Surprisingly, the results indicated that the synthetic voice was just as persuasive as the human voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8_115">Stern, Mullennix, Dyson, &#x0026; Wilson, 1999</xref>). Even so, in real life, we bet those computers are easier to hang up on.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In this chapter, we learned that persuasion is not as simple as what you say. How you say something may be just as, if not more, important. We also learned that there are many categories of nonverbal communication that affect the process of persuasion. In our examination of kinesics, for instance, we saw that people are generally more persuasive when they (1) make eye contact, (2) use facial expressions and body movements that signal relaxation and sociability, and (3) use more emblems and illustrators but fewer adaptors. Similarly, we noted that people tend to be more compliant when they are touched or approached at distances that violate their expectations, as long as the touch and distances are not perceived as being too inappropriate. Moreover, people can make themselves appear more credible, dominant, or powerful, and, in turn, affect their persuasiveness through the use of <target target-type="page" id="page_203">203</target>time, artifacts, or physical appearance. Those who control others&#x2019; time, wear the right clothing at the right time, and are attractive tend to be more persuasive than their counterparts. Finally, various features of the voice, particularly its rate, influence how persuasive one tends to be.</p>

<p>THE STUDY OF PERSUASION and the study of rhetoric, if not one and the same, are closely related. Aristotle, for instance, defined <italic>rhetoric</italic> as &#x201C;the faculty of discovering all the available means of persuasion.&#x201D; Although, in everyday parlance the term &#x201C;rhetoric&#x201D; is often used in conjunction with words such as &#x201C;empty&#x201D; or &#x201C;meaningless,&#x201D; the connotations surrounding the term were not always so negative. The ancient Greeks and Romans, for example, considered rhetoric an essential ingredient in a good education. By the time the great Roman orator Cicero wrote about rhetoric, its study was divided into five parts. Four were called <italic>inventio, elocutio, memoria,</italic> and <italic>pronuntiatio,</italic> which focused on finding and inventing arguments, speaking with style, remembering arguments, and delivering speeches effectively. The last part, <italic>dispositio,</italic> focused on selecting the most important arguments and ideas and on the effective and orderly arrangements of those ideas <target target-type="page" id="page_211">211</target>and arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_18">Corbett, 1971</xref>). Quintilian, another Roman rhetorician, noted the significance of strategically planning and organizing a persuasive message. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_18">Corbett (1971)</xref> wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>Quintilian hints at the more important concern of disposition when he says that it is to oratory what generalship is to war. It would be folly to hold a general to a fixed, predetermined disposition of his forces. He must be left free to distribute his troops in the order and proportion best suited to cope with the situation in which he may find himself at any particular moment. So he will mass some of his troops at one point on the battle line, thin them out at other points, keep other troops in reserve, and perhaps concentrate his crack troops at the most crucial area. Guided by judgment and imagination, the general stands ready to make whatever adjustments in strategy eventualities may dictate.</p>
<attrib>(pp. 299&#x2013;300)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When planning a persuasive message, we are often confronted with questions of strategy such as &#x201C;What should I leave in, and what should I leave out?&#x201D; &#x201C;How should I arrange my arguments?&#x201D; and &#x201C;Should my strongest arguments come first or last?&#x201D; However, in addition to questions concerning the order of arguments within persuasive messages, there is the issue of the sequencing of messages when more than one persuader is involved. For example, imagine that you are about to speak to a large audience and want to convince that audience to lower tuition at your school. You know that after you&#x2019;ve spoken, another person will argue just the opposite: Tuition should be raised. Is there anything you can do to make your opponent&#x2019;s arguments less powerful? In this chapter we examine these issues.</p>

<title>Implicit and Explicit Conclusions: Let Me Spell it Out For You</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_37">Lee (2014)</xref>, one of the most common approaches to advertising is based on the hope that consumers will draw their own inferences, which, in turn, will lead them to hold favorable attitudes toward a specific product. Consider, for example, the following ad:
<disp-quote>
<p>A commercial &#x2026; begins when a perky young woman comes on the screen and says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got a question. Pay attention, there will be a quiz later. People prefer their hamburgers at home and flame-broiled. Now, if McDonald&#x2019;s and Wendy&#x2019;s <italic>fry</italic> their hamburgers and Burger King <italic>flame-broils</italic> theirs &#x2026; where do you think people should go for a hamburger?&#x201D;</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_77">Sawyer, 1988</xref>, p. 159)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Because this advertisement relies on customers to draw their own inferences (in this case, &#x201C;People should go to Burger King&#x201D;), it uses what persuasion scholars refer to as an <italic>implicit conclusions approach</italic>. Had the spokesperson said, &#x201C;People should go to Burger King,&#x201D; the ad would have used an <italic>explicit conclusion</italic> approach, in which case claims are directly stated by the person sending the message (e.g., &#x201C;You should buy our product,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Our product is simply the best&#x201D;).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_212">212</target>One possible advantage of an implicit approach is that receivers may prefer their own conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_34">Kardes, Kim, &#x0026; Lim, 1994</xref>). On the other hand, there are risks. For example, what if receivers are unable to draw the desired conclusions? Perhaps the content of the message is too complex. Or what if the situation doesn&#x2019;t lend itself to &#x201C;filling in the blanks&#x201D;? Some forms of entertainment are meant to be persuasive. When people are reading literature or watching television shows, for instance, can they be expected to actively draw conclusions? Or are they simply caught up in the drama, lost in a good book, and better off having conclusions drawn for them?</p>
<p>To find out, one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_49">Moyer-Guse, Jain, &#x0026; Chung, 2012</xref>) aired an episode of a prime-time television drama (<italic>Law &#x0026; Order: SVU</italic>) that focused on the issue of drunk driving. After viewing it, one group of participants watched an epilogue, featuring an actress from the show, who explicitly emphasized the dangers of drunk driving. Other participants watched the show or the epilogue, but not both. Results indicated that a combination of episode <italic>and</italic> epilogue was most persuasive. In other words, explicit messages worked best. This seems to be the case not only when it comes to narrative-based materials (e.g., literature and television), but also with persuasive speeches and arguments as well. Indeed, according to one review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_19">Dillard, 2014</xref>), explicit messages are most persuasive because they provide clear directions to receivers.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s not to say that implicit messages should be abandoned altogether. Indeed, given the right conditions, they can be especially effective. For instance, when messages are personally relevant to the receiver (e.g., Bubba is in the market for a new car when a Volkswagen ad pops up), implicit conclusions are more persuasive than explicit ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_78">Sawyer &#x0026; Howard, 1991</xref>). Similarly, because people who are &#x201C;high in the need for cognition&#x201D; (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter6">Chapter 6</xref>) are more likely to &#x201C;fill in the blanks,&#x201D; they prefer implicit approaches to explicit ones (Martin, Lang, and Wong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_41">2003/2004</xref>). Finally, when people are suspicious of persuaders&#x2019; intentions, they tend to view an explicit-conclusion approach as pushy, rendering it less effective than an implicit approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_42">Martin &#x0026; Strong, 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Gain-Framed Versus Loss-Framed Messages: Keep on the Sunny Side?</title>
<p>Imagine for a moment that one of those deadly swine or avian flu viruses has swept into your neighborhood and is predicted to kill 600 people unless immediate action is taken. If you were in charge and given the following choices, which action would you choose?
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Action 1</italic>: guarantees that 200 of the 600 people will be saved.</p>
<p><italic>Action 2</italic>: gives a 33.3 percent chance that all 600 people will be saved and a 66.6 percent chance that no one will be saved.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Got your answer?</p>
<p>If you are like the majority of people in a classic study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_84">Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1981)</xref>, you picked Action 1. Interestingly, however, another group of people were presented with exactly the same scenario, with the options worded in a slightly different way:
<disp-quote>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_213">213</target><italic>Action 1</italic>: guarantees that 400 of the 600 people will die.</p>
<p><italic>Action 2</italic>: gives a 33.3 percent chance that no one will die and a 66.6 percent chance that everyone will die.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Notice the difference? The first pair of actions looks on the brighter side by focusing on how many lives will be saved, while the second pair of actions portrays the glass half empty by focusing on how many will die. Persuasion scholars refer to messages like the first pair as <italic>gain-framed</italic> and messages like the second pair as <italic>loss-framed</italic>. And it turns out that such framing of messages can make a big difference. Indeed, the majority of people in the second group chose Action 2. This, then, led early researchers to conclude that, people are <italic>risk averse;</italic> they fear losses more than they prefer gains. As such, they are willing to take greater risks in order to avoid or recoup their losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_84">Tversky &#x0026; Kahneman, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequent research, however, suggests that, overall, there are no noticeable differences between the persuasiveness of loss-framed and gain-framed messages (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_19">Dillard, 2014</xref>). That said, some conditions may favor one approach over the other. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_50">Nan (2012)</xref> found that <italic>present-minded people</italic>, who tend to focus on the short-term consequences of their decisions, responded more favorably to loss-framed messages. However, <italic>future-minded people</italic>, who consider long-term consequences of their decisions, were equally persuaded by loss- and gain-framed messages. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_30">Hull and Hong (2016)</xref> found that people who are <italic>high sensation seekers</italic> (think bungee jumpers and skydivers) are more persuaded by loss-framed messages, while <italic>low sensation seekers</italic> are more persuaded by gain-framed messages. Another study found that, when people are in a good mood, loss-framed messages are most persuasive. This might be because positive moods help people cope with aversive, yet useful, information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_87">Wirtz, Sar, &#x0026; Ghuge, 2015</xref>). Finally, because people may perceive disease-detecting behaviors (e.g., mammography, HIV screening) as risky in the sense that such behaviors might reveal something that is feared, using loss-framed messages may be a more effective way to motivate people to follow through on preventive medical check-ups. A doctor, for instance, might tell a patient, &#x201C;if you don&#x2019;t detect cancer early, you narrow your options for treatment.&#x201D; In contrast, because people may perceive disease-preventing behaviors (e.g., wearing sunscreen, exercising) as less risky, using gain-framed messages may be more effective. For instance, a doctor might offer a health-affirming message such as, &#x201C;Eating a lot of veggies will help you maintain your good health.&#x201D; Recent research using meta-analysis suggests that, while gain-framed appeals are indeed more effective than loss-framed appeals when trying to promote dental hygiene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_53">O&#x2019;Keefe &#x0026; Jensen, 2007</xref>), loss-framed appeals were more effective than gain-framed appeals for promoting breast cancer-detection behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_54">O&#x2019;Keefe &#x0026; Jensen, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantity Versus Quality of Arguments: The More the Merrier?</title>
<p>What are you going to have for your next dinner? If given the choice between an all-you-can-eat buffet and a fancy French restaurant, which would you pick? We imagine your answer depends on whether you like to fill your belly or reward your palate. Indeed, buffets usually offer lots of mediocre food, while a good French restaurant <target target-type="page" id="page_214">214</target>typically promises small portions of fine cuisine. What appeals to you more than likely depends on your priorities.</p>
<p>The same is probably true of persuasive messages. For some people, it is the <italic>quantity</italic> of arguments presented that counts. For them, a &#x201C;kitchen sink&#x201D; approach in which an advocate throws in every available argument works best. For other people, it is the <italic>quality</italic> of arguments that counts. For such people, the number of arguments is inconsequential. They require &#x201C;gourmet&#x201D; arguments. To illustrate this notion, we return briefly to Petty and Cacioppo&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_62">1986</xref>) elaboration likelihood model (ELM), which we discussed in more detail in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter2">Chapter 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Recall that, according to the ELM, there are two routes to persuasion: the <italic>peripheral route</italic> and the <italic>central route</italic>. First, when people are persuaded by a message that they have carefully scrutinized, they are being persuaded via the central route (of course, after scrutinizing a message, they may also remain unpersuaded). Often, however, people do not scrutinize the persuasive messages. Instead, they rely on the peripheral route, which involves mental shortcuts and simple decision rules.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_61">Petty and Cacioppo (1984)</xref>, one type of peripheral cue may be the number of arguments that a persuader presents. These researchers reasoned that some people might decide that a persuasive message containing a lot of arguments must be a lot better than one that does not (&#x201C;It must be a good argument! Look at all those reasons!&#x201D;). Of course, not all people would be persuaded by a lot of weak arguments. People who carefully scrutinized the arguments, they hypothesized, would not be fooled. Results of one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_61">Petty &#x0026; Cacioppo, 1984</xref>) supported this hypothesis. Specifically, when people were not involved in a topic, the quality of the arguments they heard did not matter. Quantity did, however. They tended to be persuaded by a lot of arguments, even if the arguments were weak. In contrast, when people were involved in the topic they were not taken in by a lot of weak arguments. They were persuaded only when strong arguments were used, especially when there were a lot of strong arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_61">Petty &#x0026; Cacioppo, 1984</xref>). The moral of this line of research, then, is the following: If you think your audience will scrutinize your message, use strong arguments, but if your audience does not seem involved in the topic, a smorgasbord of arguments may be quite effective.</p>

<sec id="sec9_4">
<title>The Use of Evidence: The Proof&#x2019;s Not in the Pudding</title>
<p>Different persuasive claims require different types of proof. One common form of proof is evidence. Evidence comes in many forms including narratives, personal anecdotes, statistics, quotations, testimonials, graphs and charts, and more. Physical evidence may be offered as well (e.g., lipstick on a collar, a &#x201C;smoking gun&#x201D; memo). As a general rule, evidence facilitates persuasion. A meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_71">Reinard (1988)</xref> demonstrates that as long as the evidence is relevant to the claim being made, evidence is almost always persuasive. As is the case with the quantity versus quality of arguments discussed above, the quantity of evidence matters more when receivers have low involvement, whereas the quality of evidence matters more when receivers have high involvement.</p>
<p>Evidence sometimes functions as a <italic>peripheral cue</italic>. For example, a prosecutor might pile up a &#x201C;mountain&#x201D; of evidence against a defendant. The sheer quantity of evidence may seem so great that jurors infer that the defendant must be guilty. However, <target target-type="page" id="page_215">215</target>evidence is put to best use when receivers rely on <italic>central processing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_73">Reynolds &#x0026; Reynolds, 2002</xref>). A meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_83">Stiff (1986)</xref> revealed a significant positive correlation between evidence use and attitude change, especially when receivers were involved in the topic or issue.</p>
<p>Another benefit of using evidence is that it tends to increase a source&#x2019;s perceived credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_51">O&#x2019;Keefe, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_71">Reinard (1988)</xref> found a <italic>ceiling effect</italic> for the persuasiveness of evidence. If a source already has very high credibility, evidence won&#x2019;t help. Most everyday persuaders, however, need all the help they can get. Unless you are the foremost expert in the world on an issue, go ahead and include high-quality evidence, and lots of it, in your persuasive message.</p>
<p>One question that has been raised is whether some types of evidence are more persuasive than others. For instance, two meta-analyses have shown that using <italic>statistical proof</italic> is more effective than using <italic>anecdotal</italic> or <italic>narrative proof</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_3">Allen &#x0026; Preiss, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_36">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_11">Braverman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_26">Han &#x0026; Fink, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_28">Hoeken &#x0026; Hustinx, 2009</xref>) suggest that statistical evidence works best under some conditions (e.g., when making generalizations, when there is a lot of evidence, or when receiver involvement is high) while narrative proof works best in others (e.g., when narratives are vivid or when receiver involvement is low) (for additional considerations, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box9_1">Box 9.1</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>The Identifiable Victim Effect</title></caption>
<p>A short time ago, in a small community where one of the authors lives, a 14-year-old girl was found lying in a dry canal, shot in the back of her head. The suspects, two teenage boys, had allegedly lured her to the secluded location with plans to murder her. And yet, she survived. As the girl clung to life, people hurried to raise money. The author was moved to contribute, partly because of the incident&#x2019;s proximity, but mostly because the girl became more than just a statistic. Her name, photo, and story not only appeared on TV and newspapers, it was posted in banks, grocery stores, and other places the author frequently visited.</p>
<p>Beyond its horrible nature, the ordeal illustrates a phenomenon known as the <italic>identifiable victim effect</italic> (IVE), which suggests that people are more willing to help specific, recognizable victims than anonymous, statistical victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_33">Jenni &#x0026; Loewenstein, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_80">Schelling, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_82">Small, Lowenstein, &#x0026; Slovic, 2007</xref>). Why? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_39">Lee and Feeley (2017)</xref>, an identifiable victim evokes stronger emotional reactions than a statistical victim. According to a meta-analysis of over 40 studies, this is especially true when the victim is a photographed child suffering from poverty and/or bearing little responsibility for the need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_38">Lee &#x0026; Feeley, 2016</xref>).</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Although such studies are fascinating for academic reasons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_10">Braddock and Dillard (2016)</xref> argued that they are only meaningful if we assume that narrative and statistical evidence are naturally opposed to one other, which they are not. Indeed, not only are narratives persuasive in and of themselves, &#x201C;sometimes, characters in narratives speak in statistical arguments&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_10">Braddock &#x0026; Dillard, 2016</xref>, p. 448). As such, we think it&#x2019;s better to view different types of evidence as teammates rather than competitors. Specifically, if each type of evidence contributes to the persuasiveness of a message, why not include all of them in your message? Previous literature supports this approach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_71">Reinard (1988)</xref>, for instance, argued that a persuader might combine narrative and statistical evidence for maximum effect. He recommends starting with a narrative example and then following up with statistics to show that the example is not atypical. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis indicated that the persuasive effects of different types of evidence (i.e., assertive evidence, statistical evidence, and evidence source qualification) were additive, meaning that each contributed to the persuasiveness of a message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_36">Kim et al., 2012</xref>).

<title>Repetition and Mere Exposure: You Can Say that Again</title>
<p>Although earlier we saw that using a lot of arguments in a message can sometimes make you more persuasive, what happens if you use the <italic>same</italic> argument or message repeatedly? Stated differently, can repeating your message make you more persuasive? Several researchers have argued that <italic>message repetition</italic> can be an effective tactic, although there is some disagreement concerning why. One perspective that has received considerable attention by persuasion scholars is known as the <italic>mere exposure effect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_89">Zajonc, 1968</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_76">Sawyer (1981)</xref>, &#x201C;This theory hypothesizes that familiar objects are more liked than less familiar ones, and that by merely being repetitively exposed, something initially unfamiliar will be looked upon more <target target-type="page" id="page_217">217</target>favorably&#x201D; (p. 238). In other words, mere exposure theory suggests that we really do &#x201C;acquire tastes,&#x201D; that things can &#x201C;grow on us,&#x201D; and that &#x201C;familiarity does <italic>not</italic> breed contempt.&#x201D; By way of example, previous research has found that people&#x2019;s faces are rated as more likable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_74">Rhodes, Halberstadt, &#x0026; Brajkovich, 2001</xref>) and attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_59">Peskin &#x0026; Newell, 2004</xref>) after repeated viewing, suggesting that the old saying &#x201C;love at first sight&#x201D; should be reconsidered. Research also suggests that the effect might generalize to other, similar faces. For instance, one study found that, compared to White participants who had not been exposed to images of Black and Asian people&#x2019;s faces, those who had been exposed reported greater liking for a different set of Black and Asian faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_90">Zebrowitz, White, &#x0026; Wieneke, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In one of our favorite classic studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_89">Zajonc (1968)</xref> found that repeated exposure even made the Chinese language more likable to people who didn&#x2019;t know how to read or speak it. In the study, subjects saw pictures of Chinese characters anywhere from 1 to 25 times. Afterward, the subjects were asked to guess the meanings of the characters. Interestingly, the characters that were seen most often were &#x201C;defined&#x201D; in much more positive ways than were the characters that were seen less often. With this in mind, it&#x2019;s not surprising to us that politicians pepper front yards, telephone poles, bumpers, and just about anything they can get their hands on with their names and faces.</p>
<p>Although research has shown that mere and repeated exposure to songs, people, languages, and posters may increase likability, there has been some disagreement about whether repeating longer or more complex messages is persuasive. Several studies, for example, have found evidence for an inverted U-curve in which repetition is persuasive up to a point (about three repetitions), but after that, excessive repetition decreases a message&#x2019;s persuasiveness (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_72">Reinhard, Schindler, Raabe, Stahlberg, &#x0026; Messner, 2014</xref>). Why? Some researchers suggest that excessive repetition damages perceptions of source credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_72">Reinhard et al., 2014</xref>). Others suggest that it leads to boredom or irritation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_60">Petty &#x0026; Cacioppo, 1979</xref>), which may depend, of course, on how creative the message is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_40">Lehnert, Till, &#x0026; Carlson, 2013</xref>). The authors, for example, are so tired of that tedious Energizer bunny that they wish it would &#x201C;keep going and going&#x201D; and never come back!!! And as long as we&#x2019;re complaining, is anybody else as tired as we are of those advertisements repeatedly popping up on their mobile devices? If so, they&#x2019;ve apparently got company. Indeed, one study found that businesses can get away with sending two SMS advertisements a day. After that, the ads cease to be persuasive, perhaps because they&#x2019;re perceived as irritating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_70">Rau, Zhou, Chen, &#x0026; Lu, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, some research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_16">Claypool, Mackie, Garcia-Marques, McIntosh, &#x0026; Udall, 2004</xref>) suggests that the way people respond to repetition depends on how personally relevant the message is to the audience. Earlier, for example, we discussed a study involving messages about comprehensive exams. For students who thought they might have to take the exams, the messages were personally relevant. The opposite was true of those who thought they would never take the exams.</p>
<p>Claypool and her colleagues found that when people were presented with a familiar message that was not personally relevant to them, they were likely to respond to the message nonanalytically (analogous to peripheral processing in the ELM). In other words, rather than actively think about the message, the people responded to it <target target-type="page" id="page_218">218</target>merely on the basis of previously stored information. As a result, repetition did not increase the persuasiveness of strong over weak arguments.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when the people were presented with a familiar message that was personally relevant to them, they were likely to process the message analytically (this is analogous to ELM&#x2019;s central route to persuasion). Because repetition provided them with more opportunities to scrutinize the message, strong messages were more persuasive than weak ones when they were repeated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_16">Claypool et al., 2004</xref>). In short, like other studies we have seen so far, the research on repetition illustrates the importance of knowing your audience before trying to persuade it.</p>

<title>Order Effects and Persuasion: First Things First</title>
<p>In the preceding sections, we&#x2019;ve seen that strong arguments are not always the most persuasive and that people are generally more willing to hear a strong argument repeated rather than a weak one. Sometimes, however, it is not so easy to separate strong from weak arguments. In other words, persuasive messages often contain many arguments, some stronger than others. When that happens, whoever is delivering the persuasive message must decide how he or she should arrange the arguments. For example, imagine you&#x2019;re planning to give a persuasive speech. Should you begin with your strongest argument to create a favorable first impression? Or would it be better to dazzle your audience at the end of your speech so that the audience leaves feeling motivated? Of course, there&#x2019;s always a third option: You could compromise and put your strongest argument in the middle of your speech.</p>
<p>When strong arguments come first, a message is said to have an <italic>anticlimax order.</italic> When they come last, a message has a <italic>climax order.</italic> A message with a <italic>pyramidal order</italic> has strong arguments in the middle. But which order works best? Most research on this subject suggests that putting your strongest argument either first <italic>or</italic> last is the best strategy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_81">Sikkink, 1956</xref>). Both seem to work better than sandwiching strong arguments in the middle of a speech, but beyond that, strong arguments seem effective at either the beginning or end of a message.</p>
<p>Of course, other variables may determine whether strong or weak arguments should go first or last. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_85">Unnaba, Burnkrant, and Erevelles (1994)</xref> argued that the medium, or channel, by which a message is transmitted should determine whether strong arguments go first or last. Their study found that when groups were visually exposed to information about the characteristics of a book bag, their attitudes about the bag were the same whether they were exposed first to strong or weak arguments about the bag&#x2019;s quality. However, if they received auditory messages about the bag, they had more favorable attitudes when strong arguments came before weak arguments. Thus, when information is presented for people to hear, order is important.</p>

<sec id="sec9_7">
<title>Primacy and Recency Effects: The First Shall be Last, and the Last Shall be First</title>
<p>Up to this point, we&#x2019;ve been looking at how arguments should be selected and organized within a single speech. The issue of what goes first and what goes last extends beyond single speeches, however. It is also possible to consider whether <italic>who</italic> <target target-type="page" id="page_219">219</target>goes first and <italic>who</italic> goes last affects the process of persuasion. Nowadays, it is quite common for political candidates to be involved in debates that are not very interactive. A coin is flipped, one candidate speaks, and then the other takes a turn. When that happens, is there any advantage to speaking first, or do all good things come to those who wait? As with research on climax and anticlimax, results in this area are mixed; some studies support a <italic>primacy effect</italic> (i.e., the first arguments presented have an advantage) but others support a <italic>recency effect</italic> (i.e., the later arguments presented have an advantage). However, several studies have investigated whether some circumstances favor primacy whereas others favor recency. We consider two such circumstances now.</p>
<p>First, a classic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_48">Miller and Campbell (1959)</xref> demonstrated that the passage of time determines whether primacy or recency prevails. Primacy, they found, works best when you hear two opposing messages, back to back, and then have to wait a while before deciding what to do about the messages. For instance, a primacy effect is likely when you hear one candidate speak right after another and then wait a week before voting for one of the candidates. Why should this scenario work to the advantage of the candidate who speaks first? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_48">Miller and Campbell (1959)</xref>, with time we tend to remember information we receive first. In other words, first impressions may be lasting impressions.</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_48">Miller and Campbell (1959)</xref> found that the recency effect is more likely when you hear one message, wait some time before hearing the opposing message, and then decide immediately after the second message what you are going to do. For instance, a recency effect is likely if you hear one candidate give a speech and then, just before voting, hear the opposing candidate give a speech. Why, in this situation, should the second candidate prevail? The researchers argued that because we tend to forget information rapidly, we&#x2019;ll have forgotten most of the first message by the time we vote. However, voting immediately after hearing the second message should enable us to remember most of the candidate&#x2019;s message, giving him or her an advantage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9_2">Figure 9.2</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9_1"><sup>1</sup></xref></p>

<graphic orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fig9_2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_220">220</target>In addition to time delay, the content of a message may determine whether first messages are more persuasive than second messages or vice versa. For instance, some research indicates that material that is relatively unsalient, noncontroversial, uninteresting, and unfamiliar to the audience tends to produce a recency effect. However, salient, interesting, controversial, and familiar material tends to produce a primacy effect, perhaps because an audience starts with a high level of interest that decreases over time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_24">Furnham, 1986</xref>). Thus, if given the choice to speak first or last, you may want to base your decision on the nature of your material.</p>
<p>So far, we&#x2019;ve seen that the order in which we are exposed to messages affects how we respond to such messages, but does the same hold true when we are sampling products? Nowadays, it&#x2019;s common for marketers to spend billions of dollars each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_86">Wadhwa, Shiv, &#x0026; Nowlis, 2008</xref>) beckoning consumers with samples of products such as cheese, music, wine, and perfume. While some folks might sample one item, others, including a couple authors we know (ahem!), make meals through the process of &#x201C;researching&#x201D; multiple items. If you, too, are a multiple sampler, you might be interested in a series of studies conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_9">Biswas, Grewal, and Roggeveen (2010)</xref>. These researchers examined what would happen if people sampled and evaluated more than one product. Results of their initial studies found evidence for a recency effect. Specifically, when people sampled two equally desirable music clips, they preferred the clip they sampled second, but when they sampled two equally undesirable music clips, they preferred the one they had sampled first. The same results were found for beverage samplers. This, the authors argued, is because people have better recall for what they sampled last. As such, if whatever they sampled last seemed icky, they preferred the alternative. In contrast, if whatever they sampled last seemed delightful, they stuck with it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, however, the pattern of results changed depending on the product being sampled. Specifically, in one of their later studies, Biswas and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_9">2010</xref>) found, as they had before, that people who sampled two equally desirable music clips preferred the second clip. Conversely, people who sampled two equally desirable scissors preferred the first pair of scissors. How can these results be explained? According to Biswas et al., <italic>nonexperiential products</italic>, such as scissors, are different from <italic>experiential products</italic>, such as food and music. This is because evaluations of experiential products depend on sensory reactions rather than informational components. Such sensory reactions are more immediate, thereby giving recently sampled products an advantage. In contrast, evaluations of nonexperiential products depend on informational components (e.g., the scissors&#x2019; blade sharpness, material, shape). As such, when sampling them, consumers&#x2019; short-term working memory can become crowded, making people less likely to notice the desirable qualities of the follow-up product. As a consequence, they tend to prefer the first product.</p>

<title>An Ounce of Prevention: Inoculation, Message-Sidedness, and Forewarning</title>
<p>Parents sometimes admonish their children by saying &#x201C;and if your friends told you to jump off a cliff, would you do that, too?&#x201D; Scolding kids for something they&#x2019;ve already done, however, may just make them feel dumb. We&#x2019;re sure that parents would much <target target-type="page" id="page_221">221</target>rather prevent their children from doing &#x201C;dumb stuff&#x201D; in the first place. Likewise, governments have and still wish to prevent their citizens from adopting certain political viewpoints. For instance, did you know that citizens of the former Soviet Union were not supposed to play Monopoly, a clearly capitalistic game? Moreover, after World War II, there was widespread paranoia in the United States that Americans would be brainwashed by Communist propaganda. In short, although most of this book has been devoted to examining how people persuade other people, oftentimes a more immediate concern centers on how to <italic>prevent</italic> people from being persuaded. This section discusses research and theory on such preventive attempts. Because the term &#x201C;prevention&#x201D; often implies something happening <italic>before</italic> something else, we hope it&#x2019;s clear why we&#x2019;ve included this topic in a chapter on order effects in persuasion. We begin by examining inoculation theory, a classic perspective developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_44">William McGuire (1964)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="sec9_8_1">
<title>Inoculation Theory: Of Needles and Arguments</title>
<p><italic>Inoculation theory</italic> might best be understood by using a biological analogy. Specifically, if you want to keep your body healthy, what should you do? One strategy is to eat your Wheaties and Flintstones vitamins, avoid fats and sugars, stay rested, and exercise. This is what is known as a <italic>supportive strategy</italic> or treatment. The rationale here is that a stronger body will be more effective at fending off diseases and viruses. A second way to stay healthy is through <italic>inoculation.</italic> Perhaps your rear end has forgotten all of those needles it encountered in your youth (e.g., DPT immunizations), but if you&#x2019;ve ever had a flu shot or treated your dog or cat to a rabies booster, you&#x2019;re familiar with the reasoning behind such injections. The idea is that if you or Fido are exposed to a small dose of a disease virus, your bodies are better able to defend themselves against the virus later. This is because a dose that is too small to give you the disease often stimulates your body&#x2019;s defenses. Thus, if exposed to a stronger dose of the virus later, your body can overpower it.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_44">McGuire (1964)</xref>, this metaphor can also be applied to situations involving persuasion. For example, imagine you are a lawyer hired to defend someone who is accused of murder but who is innocent. You realize that after you have a chance to present your case, another lawyer will argue against you, presenting evidence that he or she hopes will help convict your client. With that in mind, what might you do? First, you could use a <italic>supportive strategy</italic>, making the jury&#x2019;s belief in your client&#x2019;s innocence as &#x201C;healthy&#x201D; as possible by spending a lot of time discussing reasons why the client is not guilty. On the other hand, you could use an <italic>inoculation strategy</italic>, which consists of two parts. The first, <italic>threat</italic>, warns jurors that a challenging argument is approaching. The second, <italic>refutational preemption</italic>, exposes jurors to weak doses of the approaching arguments and shows how such arguments might be refuted. The hope is that jurors exposed to weak doses of the opposition&#x2019;s argument will be less persuaded.</p>
<p>In a classic test of inoculation theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_46">McGuire and Papageorgis (1961)</xref> focused on the support and refutation of <italic>cultural truisms</italic>. A cultural truism is a belief whose truth is taken for granted. For example, the idea that &#x201C;it is good to brush your teeth after every meal, if possible&#x201D; is a cultural truism because it is generally accepted in our culture. According to McGuire and Papageorgis, however, cultural truisms should <target target-type="page" id="page_222">222</target>also be especially vulnerable when attacked. This is most likely because they have never been questioned. Returning to the biological metaphor for a moment, imagine that you were raised in a plastic bubble all your life, breathing only pure, germ-free air. What would happen if you stepped out of the bubble? Your body, having never been exposed to germs, would be especially vulnerable to them. Indeed, huge numbers of Native Americans died when missionaries exposed them to smallpox and other unfamiliar European viruses. According to McGuire and Papageorgis, the same thing can happen with cultural truisms. Unlike beliefs on such topics as capital punishment and the legalization of drugs, which may be challenged frequently, cultural truisms exist in what amounts to hermetically sealed bubbles; they&#x2019;ve never been questioned, they&#x2019;ve never required defense, and, therefore, they are sitting ducks when attacked. Even so, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_46">McGuire and Papageorgis (1961)</xref> argued that inoculation could help defend such beliefs.</p>
<p>To test this notion, these researchers exposed participants in their study to several messages that attacked cultural truisms (e.g., brushing your teeth too much damages the teeth&#x2019;s protective enamel). Two days before hearing the attacking messages, however, the participants were provided with one of two defenses against the attacks. One group of participants was equipped with a <italic>supportive defense</italic>&#x2014;that is, they were presented with several arguments that supported the cultural truisms. A second group of participants received an <italic>inoculation defense</italic> against the attacking message; they heard weak messages attacking a cultural truism in addition to arguments that refuted the attacks. A third group of participants was not provided with any defense. After hearing the attacking messages, the participants rated the degree to which they believed the cultural truisms were true or false. Results of the study supported the researchers&#x2019; expectations. Specifically, both the supportive and inoculation defenses were better than no defense at all at making participants more resistant to persuasion. Moreover, the group that had been inoculated was the most resistant to the attacking messages. A recent meta-analysis of more than 40 studies arrived at the same conclusion: Inoculation treatments are more effective than supportive treatments and nontreatments at conferring resistance to persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_5">Banas &#x0026; Rains, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Research also suggests that inoculating people against one particular argument may make them resistant to other, different arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_57">Papageorgis &#x0026; McGuire, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_58">Parker, Rains, &#x0026; Ivanov, 2016</xref>). This &#x201C;<italic>blanket of protection</italic>,&#x201D; as it has been called (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_63">Pfau, 1997</xref>), is analogous to getting penicillin for pneumonia, but, as a result, also being protected against strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. For example, imagine you hold the belief that a person should drink eight glasses of water a day. A counterargument might be that too much water neutralizes acids that you need for proper digestion. To get you to resist such a counterargument, we might inoculate you by providing weak doses and refutations of the &#x201C;neutralize acid&#x201D; argument. In doing so, the research shows that you will become more resistant to other, new arguments to which you weren&#x2019;t originally exposed. For instance, you will be more resistant to a message that says drinking too much water now can wear out your bladder and lead to incontinence in old age.</p>
<p>Why would such generalized immunization work? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_57">Papageorgis and McGuire (1961)</xref>, inoculation causes people to think of more arguments that support their beliefs, thereby making subsequent attacking arguments less credible. Thus, once a cultural truism has been defended, it is easier to defend against a later attack, even if the arguments attacking it are different from the original arguments.</p>

<caption><title>When Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: Inoculation Theory Applied</title></caption>
<p>It&#x2019;s clear from our discussion of inoculation theory that inoculation works effectively with messages that attack cultural truisms in laboratory settings. But how does the theory pan out when tested in &#x201C;real-life&#x201D; settings? First, Pfau, Van Bockern, and Kang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_65">1992</xref>) argued that inoculation might be a good approach to use if you want to prevent young adolescents from smoking cigarettes. According to these researchers&#x2019; sources, more than 3,000 teenagers become smokers each day and, as a result, millions die of smoke-related diseases later in life. Because more than half of all smokers become &#x201C;regulars&#x201D; before high school, Pfau and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_65">1992</xref>) conducted their study using seventh graders. The students were shown videos that (1) warned them that peer pressure might cause them to change their minds about smoking and (2) presented and refuted arguments that challenged the students&#x2019; attitudes about smoking (e.g., smoking is cool). Results showed that inoculation helped students resist smoking, but only if the students had low self-esteem. Interestingly, however, a follow-up study two years later found just the opposite: Inoculation worked for students with high self-esteem but not for those with low self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_64">Pfau &#x0026; Van Bockern, 1994</xref>). Thus, inoculation may wear off for those with low self-esteem, but there may be a sleeper effect for those with high self-esteem. Whatever the case, the authors argue that inoculating children against smoking must occur between elementary school and high school. After that, resistance strategies do not seem to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_64">Pfau &#x0026; Van Bockern, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_66">Pfau, Kenski, Nitz, and Sorenson (1990)</xref> examined inoculation in political campaigns. These researchers noted that negative advertisements, in which one politician attacks another, are becoming more common and that one-third to one-half of all political ads may be negative. With that in mind, what should politicians do? One possibility is to inoculate voters; another is to wait until they are attacked and then refute the attacks. To test which strategy works best, Pfau and colleagues sent messages to voters during the 1988 presidential campaign. Voters received messages attacking their preferred candidate. Some of the voters were inoculated before being exposed to the attack message. Other voters, after being exposed to the attack message, received a message that refuted it. Results of the study found that an inoculation strategy worked the best. Those voters who had been inoculated were the least affected by the attack message.</p>
<p>In short, research has shown inoculation theory to be robust in applied contexts. Of course, given our space, we have only been able to scratch the surface here, but we hope you can imagine the wide array of contexts where an inoculation approach shows promise. For instance, recent research has detailed the ways in which inoculation might be used to defend people against conspiracy propaganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_4">Banas &#x0026; Miller, 2013</xref>), deceptive advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_43">Mason &#x0026; Miller, 2016</xref>), and inoculation itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_4">Banas &#x0026; Miller, 2013</xref>).</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Over time, inoculation theory has been refined. Researchers have discovered a number of variables that influence resistance to persuasion, including the audience&#x2019;s level of involvement with a topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_67">Pfau et al., 2004</xref>), and the degree to which psychological reactance (e.g., telling people that their freedom to hold a current attitude will be challenged) can give a boost to inoculation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_47">Miller, Ivanov, Sims, Compton, Harrison, Parker, Parker, &#x0026; Averbeck, 2013</xref>).

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_224">224</target>One-Sided Versus Two-Sided Messages: Both Sides Now</title>
<p>In the previous section, we saw that either supportive or inoculation treatments can be effective at making people resistant to persuasion. With that in mind, you might be wondering if a <italic>combination</italic> of supportive and inoculation treatments might work even better. A considerable amount of past research has examined this issue by trying to determine whether a <italic>one-sided message,</italic> presenting arguments in favor of a single proposition, is more or less persuasive than a <italic>two-sided message,</italic> which presents arguments in favor of one proposition and considers opposing arguments as well. In other words, when trying to persuade an audience to accept your arguments and reject your opponent&#x2019;s arguments, is it best to address your opposition or ignore them?</p>
<p>The first empirical study to investigate this issue was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_29">Hovland, Lumsdaine, and Sheffield (1949)</xref>, at the request of the War Department during World War II. The study&#x2019;s purpose was to determine the best way to convince U.S. soldiers that the war in Japan would last a considerable amount of time. The researchers asked their subjects to listen to one of two messages. One presented arguments that supported the war with Japan and argued that the war would be a long one. The other message included the same arguments as the first, in addition to a brief description of opposing arguments. Results of the study found that the effectiveness of one- or two-sided arguments depended on two factors: education level and initial attitude. First, the one-sided message was more effective for persuading subjects with little education, whereas the two-sided message was more effective for persuading subjects who had at least a high school education. Second, when the subjects initially agreed with the argument presented, they were more persuaded by the one-sided argument. Just the opposite was true of subjects who initially disagreed with the argument presented.</p>
<p>Although the large number of studies examining the effects of one- and two-sided messages has produced some contradictory findings, work by Daniel O&#x2019;Keefe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_52">1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_1">Mike Allen (1998)</xref> has demonstrated that such findings are not contradictory when you consider the type of two-sided messages that have been used in past studies. Specifically, they argue that some studies have used two-sided messages that are <italic>nonrefutational.</italic> In these messages, opposing arguments are mentioned but not argued against. However, some studies have used two-sided messages that are <italic>refutational,</italic> such as those used in the inoculation studies discussed earlier. In these messages, opposing arguments are not only mentioned but also shown to be inferior to the position advocated by the speaker.</p>
<p>These researchers suspected that <italic>two-sided messages</italic> that are refutational would be much more persuasive than those that merely mention opposing arguments. In fact, they suspected that two-sided arguments that did not refute opposing arguments might make a speaker less persuasive than would <italic>one-sided arguments</italic>. Hence, the contradictions of past research.</p>
<p>To test their idea, these researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_1">Allen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_2">Allen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_52">O&#x2019;Keefe, 1999</xref>) examined a large number of previous studies on message-sidedness, this time taking into account both types of two-sided messages. What they found confirmed their hypothesis: Two-sided messages were more persuasive than one-sided messages, as long as the two-sided messages were refutational. When they were not refutational, they were less persuasive than one-sided messages (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl9_1">Table 9.1</xref>). Moreover, speakers <target target-type="page" id="page_225">225</target>who used two-sided refutational messages were more credible than those who used one-sided messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_52">O&#x2019;Keefe, 1999</xref>), which makes sense. Indeed, such speakers may not only seem more informed, they may seem more trustworthy because they are sharing the opposing side&#x2019;s point of view. Consistent with this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_20">Eisend (2010)</xref> found that speakers boosted their credibility when they presented two-sided messages, as long as they were perceived to be doing so voluntarily. This, of course, makes sense. If a spokesperson for a cigarette company disclosed all the negative side effects that might result from smoking, and we knew the spokesperson was required to do so by law, why should we trust him or her? Whatever the case, the practical implications of this research are clear: When delivering a message, present the opponent&#x2019;s perspective, but make sure you &#x201C;go all the way&#x201D; by refuting your opponent&#x2019;s position. It will make you appear more credible and help you be more persuasive. This is particularly true when your audience is ambivalent about the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_17">Cornelis, Cauberghe, &#x0026; De Pelsmacker, 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Forewarning: You&#x2019;d Better Watch Out</title>
<p>In the classic film <italic>A Few Good Men,</italic> Kevin Bacon and Tom Cruise play lawyers who are prosecuting and defending two Marines accused of murder. At the beginning of the trial, Bacon&#x2019;s character, the prosecutor, tells the jury to beware; the defense attorney, he warns, &#x201C;will try a little misdirection. He&#x2019;s going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official-sounding terms like &#x2018;Code Red.&#x2019;&#x201D; A similar tactic was used in the 2000 presidential campaign, when Al Gore warned voters that George W. Bush would try to scare them about issues such as Medicare. In each of these cases, the warnings were not effective (both Bacon and Gore lost), but considerable research indicates that <italic>forewarning</italic> an audience of a persuasive message can be an effective way of making the audience resistant to that message. Of course, this line of research is related to inoculation, although the two tactics are distinct; whereas inoculation refutes and exposes people to a weakened dose of the attacking message, forewarning only makes people aware of a possible <italic>counterattitudinal</italic> attack.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_56">Papageorgis (1968)</xref>, there are two types of forewarning messages. First, you can simply warn people that they will hear a message intended to persuade them. Second, you can warn people by telling them about the topic and position taken in the persuasive message. Research indicates that both tactics are moderately effective at inducing resistance to persuasion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_8">Benoit, 1998</xref>). Even so, the process by which each tactic works may be different. For instance, when people are warned about a topic and position, it permits them to arm themselves with counterarguments before <target target-type="page" id="page_226">226</target>the attack. If forewarning about a persuasive topic and position works by making people <italic>counterargue</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_22">Freedman and Sears (1965)</xref> thought that the amount of time between the warning and the persuasive speech might be an important variable moderating the effect of forewarning. They hypothesized that people who were given more time between the warning and the persuasive message would be able to think of more counterarguments and should, therefore, be more resistant to persuasion than those who were given little time. To test this hypothesis, the researchers told high school students that they would hear a message arguing that teenagers were a menace on the road and should not be allowed to drive. After being warned, some of the students were exposed to the message immediately, while others did not hear the message for 2 or 10 minutes. Results of the study confirmed the hypothesis; the high schoolers who waited 10 minutes were most resistant to the message. Those who were exposed to the message immediately were least resistant.</p>
<p>Despite these findings, some scholars have questioned the notion that forewarning leads to counterarguing and then resistance. Meta-analyses by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_8">Benoit (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_69">Quinn and Wood (2004)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_88">Wood and Quinn (2003)</xref>, for instance, found that the presence of a delay between a warning and a message did not matter. Thus, there is some question as to whether counterarguing is really necessary for developing resistance.</p>
<p>To examine this issue further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_75">Romero, Agnew, and Insko (1996)</xref> conducted a study. These researchers argued that if forewarning leads people to counterargue, then we should notice two things. First, people who are more motivated to counterargue should be more affected by forewarning than those who are not. Second, people who have the ability to counterargue should be more affected by forewarning than those who do not have the ability.</p>
<p>To test this notion, Romero and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_75">1996</xref>) forewarned college students who either did or did not have the motivation or ability to counterargue with a persuasive message. The researchers motivated some of the students to counterargue by making the topic of the message more personally relevant to them. Specifically, they told some of the students that the message they were about to be exposed to argued that they all should be required to take comprehensive exams before graduation. The remaining students were told that the comprehensive exams would not be required for 10 years, long after they had left the university. Thus, this second group of students was not that motivated to counterargue. In addition, the researchers hindered some students&#x2019; ability to counterargue by distracting them. Specifically, after they were warned, some students simply waited 3 minutes before being exposed to the message about comprehensive exams. Other students, however, were distracted during the 3 minutes with difficult letter and number puzzles. Thus, their ability to counterargue was hampered. Results of the study confirmed the researchers&#x2019; suspicions; compared to students without the motivation and ability to counterargue, the students who found the topic personally relevant and who were not distracted by puzzles were more resistant to the persuasive message (for more on distraction and persuasion, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box9_3">Box 9.3</xref>). In short, it seems that forewarning of topic and position made people more resistant by encouraging counterarguing.</p>
<p>That said, while 3 minutes without distraction helped people who had been forewarned, some evidence suggests that the effects of forewarning can wear off over longer periods of time. One study, for example, warned a group of older adults to be wary of a particular telephone scam. Later, these same adults were contacted via <target target-type="page" id="page_227">227</target>telephone with the same mock scam. Interestingly, those who were contacted 2 weeks after being warned were generally able to defend themselves, but those who were contacted 4 weeks later were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_79">Scheibe et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>An additional line of forewarning research is based on the <italic>strength model of self-control</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_6">Baumeister, Vohs, &#x0026; Tice, 2007</xref>). According to this model, in the same way that our muscles get tired from exertion, our mental resources become depleted when we work hard to regulate our behavior. As a result of such depletion, our willpower suffers. If you&#x2019;ve ever been to a dinner party while trying to diet, you may understand just how exhausting self-control can be. And if you&#x2019;re at all like us, by the end of such meals, you&#x2019;ve been spotted shoveling dessert into your face by the handful. But what if you&#x2019;d been warned before arriving to the party that your favorite dessert was on the menu? Would you be better able to resist it? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_32">Janssen, Fennis and Pruyn (2010)</xref>, such warnings are effective because, when exposed to them, we conserve our mental resources so we can mobilize them when needed later. To illustrate, these researchers conducted several studies. In them, some participants were mentally tuckered out (e.g., they gave speeches about themselves but were not allowed to use the word &#x201C;I&#x201D;), while others were not. In addition, some participants were warned that they would eventually be exposed to persuasive <target target-type="page" id="page_228">228</target>messages asking them to volunteer their time or money for charitable causes. Results showed that mentally depleted participants, compared to nondepleted participants, were more persuadable unless they had been forewarned. Apparently, the forewarned participants conserved their mental energy, enabling them to counterargue effectively and, in turn, to resist influence.</p>

<caption><title>Distraction and Persuasion</title></caption>
<p>Did you know that it is not unheard of for people working on political campaigns to send hecklers to their opponents&#x2019; speeches? The practice is known as bracketing (Pinocchio index, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_68">1996</xref>). It almost certainly is designed to fluster the heckled candidate. What bracketers may not be aware of, however, is that heckling may actually benefit the heckled speaker. Indeed, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_7">Beatty and Kruger (1978)</xref> found that when an audience identifies with a heckled speaker, the speaker is more persuasive and is perceived as more credible. But how is it possible that the effects of heckling can be exactly opposite to those intended? According to one perspective, distraction, whether caused by hecklers, flashing lights, eating, static, loud noises, or other things, prevents people from scrutinizing a counterattitudinal message. And if they cannot scrutinize the message, people are more likely to be persuaded by it.</p>
<p>Although considerable research supports this explanation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_21">Festinger &#x0026; Maccoby, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_35">Keating &#x0026; Brock, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_55">Osterhouse &#x0026; Brock, 1970</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_14">Buller (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_15">Buller and Hall (1998)</xref> examined several studies and found more support for a different perspective. Specifically, learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_45">McGuire, 1969</xref>) argues that to be persuaded, people must first comprehend a message. Because distraction hinders comprehension, distraction also should decrease the persuasiveness of a message. Buller and Hall&#x2019;s work supports this notion by indicating that distraction generally reduces the effectiveness of a persuasive message. This may depend, however, on the type of distraction being examined. For instance, in addition to distraction that is external to a communicator (such as hecklers and loud noises), a second type of distraction can be initiated by the communicator. For example, you might be distracted by someone who stands too close or who uses intense language. According to Buller and Hall, when a distraction is initiated by a communicator, our reaction depends not so much on comprehension or counterarguments as on the communicator&#x2019;s credibility. Specifically, when distracted by a highly credible source, we tend to be more persuaded; when distracted by a less credible source, we tend to be less persuaded. Thus, if you are a highly credible source and want to be persuasive, feel free to distract your audience.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>It may be the case, however, that counterarguing is not the only factor mediating the effectiveness of forewarning. To be sure, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_31">Jacks and Devine (2000)</xref> found that, for some people, forewarning heightened not only counterarguing but also irritation&#x2014;that is, some people, when warned that specific attitudes they held would be attacked, became more agitated and angry. This, in turn, led them to be more resistant to attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_31">Jacks &#x0026; Devine, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although warning people about a topic and position provides them with an opportunity to think of and rehearse counterarguments, it is clear that the other type of warning&#x2014;a warning about persuasive intent&#x2014;does not. Indeed, if people don&#x2019;t know what the topic will be, how can they think of counterarguments? But if counterarguing is not responsible for the effectiveness of this type of warning, what is? As noted in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter8">Chapter 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_12">Brehm (1966)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_13">Brehm and Brehm (1981)</xref> argued that when people feel that their freedom to behave or think in a certain way is restricted, they experience <italic>psychological reactance</italic> and attempt to restore their freedom. If you&#x2019;ve ever tried reverse psychology on a child, you are familiar with how psychological reactance works. For instance, some time ago, one of the authors was having trouble getting his preschooler to pack up his toys, leave his pals, and get in the car to go home. The child, of course, thought he had the freedom to choose: stay with his pals or get in the car. However, when dad pretended he was leaving without his son, the child gathered his toys and hurried into the car. Why? His freedom to choose the ride home was being taken away. He was reacting to the loss of freedom.</p>
<p>According to some writers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_23">Fukada, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_27">Hass &#x0026; Grady, 1975</xref>), this phenomenon occurs when you are warned that someone intends to persuade you. It&#x2019;s like a comedian who tells you that he or she will make you laugh before telling a joke. We like to feel free to laugh or to be persuaded, and if we feel that freedom is in jeopardy, we experience <italic>psychological reactance</italic>; we don&#x2019;t laugh or we resist persuasion. To illustrate this principle, Fukada told one group of people that they would be exposed to a message intended to make them afraid and to change their attitude. Another group did not receive the warning. Later, both groups received a message that tried to persuade them to be tested for syphilis. Results indicated that the warned group not only experienced more psychological reactance, it was also less persuaded than the unwarned group.</p>
<p>Before concluding this section, we should note that not all research indicates that forewarning increases resistance to persuasion. Indeed, a meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_88">Wood and Quinn (2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_69">Quinn &#x0026; Wood, 2004</xref>) found that, in some cases, forewarning shifts attitudes toward the impending message. It all depends on the motives of the audience. Specifically, as we have seen, when people want to defend their existing attitudes, forewarning is effective at increasing resistance. On the other hand, sometimes warnings threaten people&#x2019;s self-concepts by suggesting that they may be gullible or vulnerable to influence. Rather than resist, people may shift their attitude toward the future appeal in order to reduce its impact. In other cases, people may be <target target-type="page" id="page_229">229</target>concerned about the impressions they are leaving on others. For instance, they may not want to appear pigheaded to their peers. In these cases, warnings may move them to a more neutral, easily defensible position that helps them leave a good impression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_69">Quinn &#x0026; Wood, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Whatever the case, because forewarning has the potential to make people more resistant to persuasion, you might be wondering what you should do if you ever want to persuade an audience that has been warned or is aware of your intent to persuade them. With that question in mind, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9_8">Benoit (1998)</xref> offered the following advice:
<disp-quote>
<p>In these cases, the persuader may wish to attempt to compensate for the inhibiting effects of forewarning. The persuader could stress a lack of bias, emphasize that the audience&#x2019;s best interests were considered (and not just the persuader&#x2019;s own selfish interests), explain that both sides of the issue were carefully considered before a position was taken, or simply ask the audience to keep an open mind. At the very least, persuaders should moderate their expectations for success, keeping in mind that their persuasive task is more difficult when the audience is forewarned.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In this chapter, we examined the topic of message selection and organization. First, we saw that, depending on the characteristics of the audience, it&#x2019;s sometimes better for a persuader to tell the audience what to believe, but at other times it&#x2019;s best to let the audience members draw their own conclusions. Second, we saw that the ways in which messages are framed affect how they are reacted to. Third, we saw that when selecting arguments to use for persuasion, quality arguments matter with audiences that will scrutinize the message, but quantity works for less discerning audiences. Fourth, we discussed the role of evidence in the process of persuasion. Fifth, we examined message repetition and noted the conditions under which it increases and decreases persuasion. Sixth, we looked at the ways in which arguments might be ordered or arranged in a speech and indicated that the most effective order depends on several variables. Similarly, our examination of primacy and recency effects showed that when two people are giving opposing speeches, under some circumstances the first speaker may have the advantage, while under others the last speaker may have the advantage. Finally, we explored the ways in which people may be more resistant to persuasion, either by being inoculated with a weak dose of an opposing argument, by presenting two-sided refutational messages, or by being warned about the possibility of an attacking argument.</p>

<p>A POLICE OFFICER pulls a driver to the side of the road and says, &#x201C;Sir, your car was swerving all over the place. I&#x2019;d like you to blow into this breathalyzer, please.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I apologize,&#x201D; the driver replies, &#x201C;but I&#x2019;m asthmatic and can&#x2019;t blow into anything without having an asthma attack.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Alright. Let&#x2019;s head down to the station for a urine sample.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think so, officer. Given my diabetes, who knows what that might do to my blood sugar?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;You&#x2019;ll have no choice but to take a blood test, then.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Afraid not,&#x201D; the driver says. &#x201C;You see, I&#x2019;m a hemophiliac and even the slightest prick of a needle could make me bleed to death.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Fine! Step out of your car, close your eyes, and walk in a straight line.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sorry, officer.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What now?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m too drunk to do that.&#x201D;</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_236">236</target>We like this old joke not just because we think it&#x2019;s funny, but also because it illustrates one of the main themes in this chapter. Specifically, when faced with a situation involving persuasion, there&#x2019;s more than one way to skin a cat. Indeed, just as the police officer uses a variety of approaches&#x2014;some more polite than others&#x2014;to influence the driver, and just as the driver resists the officer in an assortment of ways, real-life persuaders often come up with any number of different approaches for persuading or thwarting the persuasive attempts of others. What types of strategies are available to people who are seeking or resisting compliance? What specific approaches are people most likely to use? Do the approaches people use vary across situations?</p>
<p>All of these issues have been explored by researchers who study what is often labeled <italic>compliance gaining</italic>, the topic of this chapter. Before we discuss how this important subject has been investigated and what has been found, let&#x2019;s begin with a few definitions.</p>
<sec id="sec10_1">
<title>Actions Speak the Loudest: A Definition of Compliance Gaining</title>
<p>We once knew a guy who liked to say, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care if you hate me, as long as you&#x2019;re nice to me.&#x201D; We think that this maxim is a fine illustration of the distinction between thoughts and actions that undergirds the primary difference between compliance and other forms of persuasion. As we mentioned in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter2">Chapter 2</xref>, it is useful to distinguish between the terms <italic>persuasion</italic> and <italic>compliance.</italic> Persuasion, an umbrella term, is concerned with changing beliefs, attitudes, intentions, motivations, and behaviors. Compliance is more restrictive, typically referring to changes in a person&#x2019;s overt behavior. For example, a mother might tell her 10-year-old son, &#x201C;Take out the trash.&#x201D; If the child says, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to,&#x201D; the mother might respond, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care what you want. Take out the trash!&#x201D; In this case the mother is not concerned with belief or attitude change. She doesn&#x2019;t care if the child likes taking out the trash, believes in recycling, and so on. She just wants compliance, or behavior change (i.e., the trash emptied). In short, research examining compliance gaining generally focuses on persuasion aimed at getting others to do something or to act in a particular way.</p>
<p>We should also note that compliance gaining differs from more traditional notions of persuasion in other important ways. First, for the most part, studies of compliance gaining have concentrated on influence in interpersonal and/or face-to-face contexts rather than in one-to-many contexts. Beyond that, two lines of compliance-gaining research can be identified. The first has concerned itself with determining which strategies are most effective at persuading receivers, a topic we&#x2019;ll get to in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter11">Chapter 11</xref>. The second line has focused more on &#x201C;senders&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;receivers.&#x201D; Specifically, such research has attempted to identify the broad array of strategies available to people who want to influence others. What&#x2019;s more, such studies have examined which strategies people are most likely to <italic>select and use</italic> when trying to persuade others. As such, a better title for this chapter might be &#x201C;compliance seeking,&#x201D; even though we&#x2019;ll stick with the more traditional term &#x201C;compliance gaining.&#x201D; We start by discussing how this type of research got started.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_237">237</target>In The Beginning: The Roots of Compliance-Gaining Research</title>
<p>Imagine you are a parent with a son whose room is a pigsty. What would you do to get him to clean up? Can you think of several different approaches? If not, consider the work of two sociologists, Gerald Marwell and David Schmitt (1976), who might help add a few tactics to your repertoire. Specifically, after examining past research and theory in the areas of power and influence, these two researchers developed a taxonomy of 16 different tactics that might be used to gain compliance (these tactics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl10_1">Table 10.1</xref>). Afterward, they told people to imagine themselves in four scenarios (i.e., requesting a tutor, doing more studying, making a purchase, and seeking a promotion) and asked the people how likely they would be to use each of the 16 tactics in each of the scenarios. Finally, based on their responses, Marwell and Schmitt grouped the tactics in terms of their commonalities, ultimately identifying five basic types of compliance-gaining strategies:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Rewarding activity:</italic> involves seeking compliance in an active and positive way (e.g., making promises).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Punishing activity:</italic> involves seeking compliance in an explicitly negative way (e.g., making threats).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Expertise:</italic> involves attempts to make a person think that the persuader has some special knowledge (e.g., trying to appear credible).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Activation of impersonal commitments:</italic> involves attempts to appeal to a person&#x2019;s internalized commitments (e.g., telling the person he or she will feel bad about him/herself if he/she does not comply).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Activation of personal commitments:</italic> relies on appeals to a person&#x2019;s commitment to others (e.g., pointing out that the person is indebted and should, therefore, comply to repay the favor).<target target-type="page" id="page_238">238</target></p></list-item>

<caption><title>Only a Jerk Would Refuse: An Examination of the Altercasting Tactic</title></caption>
<p>As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl10_1">Table 10.1</xref>, negative altercasting, when used as a compliance-gaining tactic, involves projecting a person into an unflattering role and then expecting the person to comply in order to avoid fitting into that role. For example, if someone collecting donations said, &#x201C;Only a heartless person would refuse to feed hungry children,&#x201D; he or she would be using negative altercasting. Before you decide to try the tactic on your own, consider this: Research suggests that people who use it are perceived as less competent than people who use more prosocial tactics, such as liking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_43">Johnson, 1992</xref>). Not only that, they may be less persuasive. In one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_72">Turner, Banas, Rains, Jang, Moore, &#x0026; Morrison, 2010</xref>), for instance, researchers tucked unmailed, stamped letters under the windshield wipers of several thousand parked vehicles. Along with the letters were messages employing one of three compliance-gaining techniques: (1) positive altercasting (&#x201C;I found this next to your car. A good person would mail it [that is, if it&#x2019;s not yours.]&#x201D;), (2) negative altercasting (&#x201C;I found this next to your car. Only a bad person wouldn&#x2019;t mail it [that is, if it&#x2019;s not yours].&#x201D;); and direct request (&#x201C;I found this next to your car. Mail it [that is, if it&#x2019;s not yours].&#x201D;). Results showed that negative altercasting did not work well. To be sure, significantly more letters were returned in the direct request and positive altercasting conditions than in the negative altercasting condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_72">Turner et al., 2010</xref>). Perhaps that&#x2019;s because people believe that only a jerk would use the negative altercasting tactic.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Marwell and Schmitt&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_52">1967</xref>) study showed that there are a wide range of tactics available to persuaders. The study was important because it became the springboard for compliance-gaining research that followed. Even so, as is often the case with research on human communication, the study made compliance gaining appear simpler than it really is. We will see later in this chapter the ways in which this study was criticized and improved on. First, however, we turn to a discussion of some of the factors that affect the selection of compliance-gaining strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10_3">
<title>Situation: The &#x201C;It Depends&#x201D; of Compliance-Gaining Behavior</title>
<p>Long before this chapter was written, one of the authors was faced with two different situations requiring persuasion. In the first, the author&#x2019;s then 2-year-old son tried to provoke a food fight at the dinner table by throwing a chunk of roast beef, gravy and all at his older brother. There was quite a splat. The 2-year-old then proceeded to reach for a second chunk, at which point the author intervened, explanining that any more &#x201C;beef bombs&#x201D; would result in a time-out (i.e., 2 minutes of sitting alone in the bedroom). Fortunately, the next hunk of beef found its way into the kid&#x2019;s mouth.</p>
<p>In the second situation, the same author needed to ask his boss to hurry up and look over some paperwork that needed the boss&#x2019;s signature. The deadline for the paperwork was nearing. Although threatening the boss with something like a time-out had appeal, quite obviously, doing so would have been inappropriate. Instead, the author tapped lightly on the boss&#x2019;s door, smiled, and asked ever so politely whether the boss had &#x201C;had a chance to look over that paperwork yet?&#x201D;</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_240">240</target>The point is that even though we can isolate a specific number of compliance-gaining strategies, not all strategies are appropriate in all situations. To be sure, even when trying to persuade the same person, different contexts require different strategies. For instance, trying to keep a 2-year-old from repeatedly playing near electrical outlets may require a different strategy than trying to get the same child to eat asparagus. Obviously, selecting a compliance-gaining strategy depends a lot on the situation.</p>
<p>For quite some time now, communication scholars have argued that compliance-gaining behavior can vary greatly from one situation to the next. By way of example, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_18">Cody, Woelfel, and Jordan (1983)</xref> showed that, when trying to decide which compliance-gaining strategy to use, there are seven situational dimensions that affect those decisions:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Dominance:</italic> The level of control or power in a relationship. For example, because a boss generally has more power to influence a subordinate than vice versa, a boss&#x2019;s strategies may differ from a subordinate&#x2019;s.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Intimacy:</italic> The level of emotional attachment or knowledge one has of a partner&#x2019;s affect. For example, because they are more intimate and more concerned with the relationship, spouses may use different strategies than strangers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Resistance:</italic> The degree to which the persuader thinks a strategy will be resisted. For example, strategies that are more likely to be resisted will probably not be used as readily as those that are less likely to be resisted. (For more information on resisting compliance, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box10_2">Box 10.2</xref>.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Personal benefits:</italic> The extent to which the self or the other is benefited by compliance. For example, strategies that are perceived to produce the greatest benefits are most likely to be used.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Rights:</italic> The extent to which a persuader thinks a request is warranted. For example, a persuader may believe that complaining about a barking dog and losing sleep is justified, but complaining about someone else&#x2019;s hairstyle is not.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Relational consequences:</italic> The degree to which a strategy will have long-term or short-term effects on the persuader&#x2019;s relationship with the persuadee. For example, a threat that may lead to divorce may be less likely than one that merely leads to an argument.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Apprehension:</italic> The degree to which a persuader perceives nervousness in the situation. For example, situations filled with anxiety may lead to different strategies than those without anxiety.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>It is clear, then, that compliance-gaining behavior depends a great deal on the situation in which it is used. In fact, research shows that these situational dimensions not only affect decisions to use strategies but also decisions to avoid them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_32">Hample &#x0026; Dallinger, 2002</xref>). In the following sections, we discuss some research findings on several of these situational dimensions.</p>
<sec id="sec10_3_1">
<title>Seeking Compliance From Strangers and Intimates</title>
<p>In what is now considered a classic study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_55">Gerald Miller, Frank Boster, Michael Roloff, and David Seibold (1977)</xref> examined the effects of intimacy on compliance-gaining behavior. These researchers imagined that compliance gaining in <target target-type="page" id="page_241">241</target>interpersonal relationships differ from compliance gaining in noninterpersonal relationships. Specifically, because people in interpersonal relationships know their partners well, they can tailor their messages to appeal to their partners&#x2019; specific wants, needs, interests, and so forth. The same is not true in noninterpersonal relationships, where little is known about the other person. In addition, Miller and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_55">1977</xref>) thought that the type of compliance-gaining strategy a person decided to use would depend on whether a situation had short-term or long-term consequences.</p>

<caption><title>Just Say No? A Look at Strategies for Resisting Compliance and Resisting Resistance</title></caption>
<p>In our opinion, a lot of advertising makes persuasion seem pretty simple. For example, Nike&#x2019;s classic &#x201C;Just do it&#x201D; campaign suggested that we should forget all about reasoning and weighing pros and cons. On the other side of the coin, you might be familiar with the once popular slogan for keeping kids off of drugs; &#x201C;Just say &#x2018;no,&#x2019;&#x201D; it advised. But is resisting compliance really all that easy? Whatever the case, some research shows that just saying &#x201C;no&#x201D; is not the only option available to us when trying to resist the compliance-gaining attempts of others. For instance, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_53">McLaughlin, Cody, and Robey (1980)</xref> identified four possible strategies you might use to resist persuasion:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Nonnegotiation: You overtly refuse to comply (you say, &#x201C;No&#x201D;).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identity management: You resist by manipulating images of the other person (you say, &#x201C;I would never make such an awful request&#x201D;).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Justifying: You justify noncompliance by pointing to negative outcomes (you say, &#x201C;If I comply with your request I might lose my job&#x201D;).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Negotiation: You engage in an alternative behavior that you propose (rather than turn off the stereo, you offer to turn it down).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Rather than look at resistance strategies, perhaps a more important issue centers on situations in which people find themselves wanting to resist compliance. One prevalent example occurs when people are pressured into having sex. Indeed, according to Impett and Peplau&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_38">2003</xref>) sources, between 26 and 40 percent of men and 50 and 65 percent of women report that they&#x2019;ve agreed to have sex even though they did not want to. With this in mind, and considering contemporary issues associated with the spread of HIV and the prevalence of date rape, researchers have examined strategies that can be used to resist sexual advances. An interesting study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_12">Byers and Wilson (1985)</xref> examined men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s perceptions of the different ways in which women refuse sexual advances by men. In the study, subjects watched a videotape of a man and woman engaged in romantic physical behavior. At some point in the tape, the woman refuses to go any further by (1) simply saying, &#x201C;No&#x201D;; (2) saying &#x201C;No&#x201D; and offering an excuse (i.e., &#x201C;someone&#x2019;s coming over&#x201D;); or (3) saying &#x201C;No&#x201D; and offering an explanation (i.e., &#x201C;we don&#x2019;t know each other well enough&#x201D;). Results of the study showed that most of the males in the study would comply with all of the requests, but several said they would be reluctant to do so. Moreover, both male and female subjects interpreted the simple &#x201C;No&#x201D; and the &#x201C;No, with explanation&#x201D; as meaning the man should stop his advances but interpreted the &#x201C;No&#x201D; with an excuse as meaning that the man should try making more advances later that day.</p>
<p>One possible problem with messages meant to resist sexual advances centers on the stereotype that &#x201C;when women say &#x2018;no,&#x2019; they really mean &#x2018;yes.&#x2019;&#x201D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_56">Muehlenhard and Hollanbaugh (1988)</xref>, for <target target-type="page" id="page_242">242</target>example, found that nearly 40 percent of women in their study claimed to have said &#x201C;no&#x201D; when they meant &#x201C;yes&#x201D; because they did not want to appear promiscuous, wanted to show concern for religious issues, and so forth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_61">Perper and Weis (1987)</xref> argued that such token resistance can cause problems by encouraging males not to take &#x201C;no&#x201D; for an answer. With this in mind, when faced with such situations, it is important to say what you mean. Indeed, research shows that direct, verbal messages, compared to indirect messages, are the best for avoiding sexual advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_14">Christopher &#x0026; Frandsen, 1990</xref>). A possible problem, however, is that sexual rejection messages that are moderately direct are perceived to be more comfortable and &#x201C;face saving&#x201D; than very direct messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_54">Metts, Cupach, &#x0026; Imahori, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>It is apparent from this discussion so far that resistance strategies, in and of themselves, may not be as important as how people respond to those resistance strategies. For instance, research indicates that people who have met with noncompliance tend to follow up with more direct strategies than they did initially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_33">Harris, Monahan, &#x0026; Hovick, 2014</xref>). Moreover, in some situations, noncompliance is likely to be met with physical aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_22">deTurck, 1987</xref>). So, what happens if your resistance meets with resistance? If you ever find yourself confronted by a person who wants you to comply when you don&#x2019;t want to, it might help to know this: Research suggests that forceful verbal and physical resistance is related to the decreased likelihood of being raped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_67">Senn, Eliasziw, Hobden, Newby-Clark, Barata, Radtke, &#x0026; Thurston, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_71">Tark &#x0026; Kleck, 2014</xref>). What&#x2019;s more, although some scholars have suggested that resistance may be dangerous because it might provoke rapists to become more violent, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_71">Tark and Kleck (2014)</xref> found that additional injuries besides rape following resistance are rare.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>To test their hypotheses, these researchers asked people how likely they would be to use each of Marwell and Schmitt&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_52">1967</xref>) strategies to persuade others in four different situations:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Noninterpersonal; short-term consequences:</italic> You want to get a car dealer, whom you barely know, to give you a &#x0024;1,000 trade-in on your old car.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Noninterpersonal; long-term consequences:</italic> You want your new neighbors, who are planning to cut down a shade tree that adds value to your home, to leave the tree standing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Interpersonal; short-term consequences:</italic> You have a close relationship with a man or woman and want to cancel a date with him or her in order to visit an old acquaintance who is passing through town.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Interpersonal; long-term consequences:</italic> You have a close relationship with a man or woman and want to persuade him or her to move to another geographical location so you can take a better job.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Results of this study showed that the situation strongly affected strategy choice. In general, people preferred &#x201C;friendly,&#x201D; socially acceptable strategies (e.g., liking) in all the situations but said they were more likely to use different tactics in different situations. For instance, threat tactics were more likely in short-term, non-interpersonal contexts. Finally, in noninterpersonal situations, people picked a greater variety of strategies, perhaps because, without knowing much about the person they were trying to persuade, more trial and error was necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_55">Miller et al., 1977</xref>).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_243">243</target>Previous research suggests that intimates, compared to strangers, are perceived to be more effective in their compliance-gaining attempts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_21">Dennis (2006)</xref>, for example, found that people expected intimates, rather than non-intimates, to be more effective when trying to persuade them to engage in healthy behaviors, especially when their intimate others used strategies showing that they cared (e.g., &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want your weight to bother you. You should eat better.&#x201D;). For some types of health-related behavior, other strategies were perceived to be effective as well. For instance, when trying to get their romantic partners to stop smoking, intimate others were perceived to be effective when using threat (e.g., &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know if I can handle being with you when you smoke.&#x201D;) and liking (e.g., &#x201C;I&#x2019;d like kissing you more if your mouth didn&#x2019;t taste like an ashtray&#x201D;) strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_21">Dennis, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the choice and perceived effectiveness of compliance-gaining strategies may differ depending on whether a relationship is interpersonal or noninterpersonal. But are all interpersonal relationships the same? One of our favorite studies shows that they are not. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_79">Witteman and Fitzpatrick (1986)</xref> argued that husbands and wives can be categorized into three different couple-types: <italic>Traditionals, Separates</italic>, and <italic>Independents</italic>. They explained that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Traditionals hold conventional values about the relationship. These values emphasize stability as opposed to spontaneity. Traditionals exhibit interdependence, both physically and psychologically, and tend not to avoid conflict. Separates hold ambivalent views on the nature of relationships, report having the least interdependence, and avoid open marital conflict. Independents hold fairly non-conventional relational values and maintain some interdependence, yet not with respect to some of the physical and temporal aspects of their lives. Also Independents report some assertiveness and tend to engage in conflict.</p>
<attrib>(p. 132)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Because couples differed in the ways they interacted, Witteman and Fitzpatrick suspected that couples also would differ in the ways they sought compliance. Results of a study confirmed these expectations. First, Traditionals sought compliance by discussing what they expected to be the positive and negative outcomes of a proposed course of action. They tended to be open and used their relationship as a basis of power. Separates, however, did not attempt to identify with their partners or to use their relationship to seek compliance. Instead, Separates focused on the negative consequences of noncompliance and tried to constrain the behavior of their spouses. Finally, Independents, compared to other couple types, used a wider variety of power bases when seeking compliance. They also tended to discount and refute their partners more than other couple types, indicating that Independent couples debate one another relatively intensely.</p>
<p>While it is clear, then, that our use of compliance-gaining strategies depends on the type and degree of intimate relationship in which we are involved, research also suggests that our compliance-seeking behaviors are affected by the particular circumstances we face in our relationships. As one example, if the person with whom you are involved starts thinking about leaving you, are there particular strategies you <target target-type="page" id="page_244">244</target>might use to save the relationship? Research by Buchanan, O&#x2019;Hair, and Becker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_7">2006</xref>) identified four overall strategies that people reported using while attempting to hang on to their spouses. <italic>Commitment</italic>, the most common strategy, includes tactics such as being more loving and caring, being submissive (&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll do anything to save this relationship.&#x201D;), and asking your partner to commit to the relationship. <italic>Alignment</italic>, the second most common strategy, includes tactics like demonstrating to other people that your partner is taken (e.g., by holding hands), punishing your partner&#x2019;s threats of infidelity, and trying to make your partner want you sexually. <italic>Negativity</italic>, the third strategy, includes tactics such as degrading your partner, making your partner jealous (e.g., by threatening to be unfaithful), and concealing your partner from others. <italic>Harm</italic>, the last and least frequent strategy, includes tactics such as threatening or being violent toward someone who might come between you and your partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_7">Buchanan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec10_3_2">
<title>Power, Legitimacy, and Politeness</title>
<p>Our earlier illustration about trying to influence a child versus a boss makes it clear that power plays a large role in the selection of compliance-gaining strategies. In what is now considered a seminal work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_29">French and Raven (1960)</xref> argued that there are five bases of power that people can draw upon to influence others:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A person with <italic>reward power</italic> has control over some valued resource (e.g., promotions and raises).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A person with <italic>coercive power</italic> has the ability to inflict punishments (e.g., fire you).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Expert power</italic> is based on what a person knows (e.g., you may do what a doctor tells you to do because he or she knows more about medicine than you do).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Legitimate power</italic> is based on formal rank or position (e.g., you obey someone&#x2019;s commands because he or she is the vice president in the company for which you work).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>People have <italic>referent power</italic> when the person they are trying to influence wants to be like them (e.g., a mentor often has this type of power).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of power that&#x2019;s at work, one thing remains clear: Power affects compliance-gaining behavior. For example, although managers are more successful when using consultation, inspirational appeals, rational persuasion, and nonpressure tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_80">Yukl, Kim, &#x0026; Falbe, 1996</xref>), because they often believe that their power adds legitimacy to their requests, they may not provide justifications or explanations when seeking compliance. Their influence strategies, therefore, may tend to be more direct than the influence strategies used by their less powerful subordinates (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_36">Hirokawa &#x0026; Wagner, 2004</xref>). Moreover, regardless of the messages they use when seeking compliance, research has shown that people with power tend to be more persuasive than those without it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_50">Levine &#x0026; Boster, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>With that said, is there any hope for people who possess little power? To address this question, several researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_2">Baxter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_19">Craig, Tracy, &#x0026; Spisak, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_76">Wilson &#x0026; Kunkel, 2000</xref>) have applied Brown and Levinson&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_6">1987</xref>) <italic>politeness theory</italic> to the study of compliance-gaining behavior.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_245">245</target>According to <italic>politeness theory,</italic> all people are motivated to maintain two kinds of face: positive and negative. We maintain <italic>positive face</italic> when others like, respect, and approve of us. We maintain <italic>negative face</italic> when we do not feel constrained or impeded by others. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_6">Brown and Levinson (1987)</xref>, when making a request of someone else, both types of faces may be challenged. First, the request may constrain the other person&#x2019;s freedom, thereby challenging his or her negative face. By way of illustration, asking someone to pick you up at the airport is challenging because it keeps a person from doing something else that he or she might rather be doing. Second, the request may imply that the other person is being taken advantage of, thereby challenging his or her positive face. For example, in our opinion, the stereotypical sports slob who shouts to his wife, &#x201C;Bring me another beer!&#x201D; does not convey much respect.</p>

</fig>
<p>So, how does the issue of power fit into the picture? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_6">Brown and Levinson (1987)</xref>, a person is less likely to comply if his or her face is threatened. Thus, to keep from threatening a person&#x2019;s positive or negative face, we try to be polite when making requests. Moreover, when trying to persuade someone who is more powerful than us, we may be extra polite because it is not as likely that our requests will be perceived as legitimate. Research so far has supported this conclusion. For example, in one study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_2">Leslie Baxter (1984)</xref> found that compared to less powerful others (i.e., group members), more powerful others (i.e., group leaders) were less polite when making requests. Similarly, two studies found that when students tried <target target-type="page" id="page_246">246</target>to persuade their instructors to change grades or paper deadlines, their compliance-gaining strategies were overwhelmingly positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_30">Golish, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_31">Golish &#x0026; Olson, 2000</xref>). Not only that, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_50">Levine and Boster (2001)</xref> found that when people with little power tried to persuade others, positively framed messages were the only ones that met with much success. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_41">Jenkins and Dragojevic (2013)</xref> found that face-threatening messages caused people to derogate both the message and the source, leading to less persuasion.</p>
<p>Considering the preceding studies, you might be wondering which types of strategies are polite and which are not. Most would agree that threats are not as polite as hints. However, threats may be more efficient than hints. To test this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_46">Kellermann and Shea (1996)</xref> asked people to rate how polite and efficient they perceived several different strategies to be. Interestingly, threats, although impolite, were not considered efficient, and hints, although inefficient, were not considered polite. Perhaps the best way to get compliance is by using direct requests (i.e., explicitly ask for what you want); such requests were among the most efficient strategies and were not considered impolite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_46">Kellermann &#x0026; Shea, 1996</xref>). Consistent with this notion, one study found that speaking debaters who were confronted with nonverbal disparagement from their opponents were perceived as most effective and appropriate when they politely and directly requested that their opponents stop displaying such disparaging behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_73">Weger, Seiter, Jacobs, &#x0026; Akbulut, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While considering the topic of politeness, keep in mind that persuasion is a two-way street. As such, people not only threaten others&#x2019; face when making requests, they do so when refusing others&#x2019; requests as well (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_42">Johnson, 2007</xref>). By way of example, it would be one thing for Olga to tell Xenia, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t take you to the airport because my driver&#x2019;s license was revoked when I was arrested for drunk driving&#x201D; (a threat to Olga&#x2019;s positive face) and quite another to tell Xenia, &#x201C;Yeah, right. You&#x2019;re not worth the time, gas, or wear and tear on my vehicle&#x201D; (a threat to Xenia&#x2019;s positive face). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_42">Johnson (2007)</xref> has shown that the nature of refusals (i.e., do they threaten the requester&#x2019;s, the target&#x2019;s, or both the requester&#x2019;s and target&#x2019;s positive and/or negative face) affect perceptions about whether the refusal is effective or appropriate.</p>
<p>It is apparent from our discussion so far that behavior designed to gain or resist compliance depends, to a large extent, on several contextual and relational dimensions. (To learn about compliance-gaining behavior in a <italic>specific</italic> context, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box10_3">Box 10.3</xref>.) The context, however, is not the only factor that affects compliance-gaining behavior. In the next section we explore the impact of individual differences on interpersonal influence.</p>

<title>Who are You? Individual Characteristics and Compliance-Gaining Behavior</title>
<p>Up to this point we&#x2019;ve talked about the whats and whens of compliance gaining. We&#x2019;ve shown that past research has pointed to a number of situational dimensions (e.g., interpersonal/noninterpersonal, short-term/long-term consequences) that influence strategy choice. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_37">Hunter and Boster (1987)</xref>, however, there is but one factor that determines what types of compliance-gaining strategies will be used in a given situation. These researchers argued that when trying to decide what <target target-type="page" id="page_247">247</target>strategy we will use, we try to determine what the emotional impact of the message will be. For example, if you tried to persuade your friend to study more, the friend might become angry and resentful. However, the friend could be grateful that you cared enough to say something. According to Hunter and Boster, we prefer using strategies that have a positive emotional impact.</p>

<caption><title>Take Two Aspirin and Call Me in the Morning: Compliance Gaining Between Doctors and Patients</title></caption>
<p>One of the authors attended a dinner party at which the conversation turned to health-related matters. Several of the guests explained how they fooled their physicians to make it appear that their blood pressure was normal. One said she raised her arms above her head for five minutes beforehand. Another said he made sure he was dehydrated when visiting his doctor. &#x201C;But why would you want to deceive your doctor about your blood pressure?&#x201D; the author asked. &#x201C;Why wouldn&#x2019;t you want to?&#x201D; one of them replied.</p>
<p>This story illustrates how attitudes can pose serious concerns for people in the medical profession. Indeed, physicians not only face patients who shade the truth about their health, they are also confronted with the task of persuading patients to comply with requests to take medication, return for regular checkups, modify their behaviors, and so forth. When one considers the personal and economic costs of not complying with doctors&#x2019; requests, the study of persuasion in medical contexts is of obvious significance.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_11">Burgoon and Burgoon (1990)</xref>, compliance gaining in medical contexts is unique because, unlike most other compliance-gaining situations, patients visit physicians voluntarily, pay for physicians&#x2019; compliance-gaining directives, perceive physicians as experts, and believe that compliance will benefit themselves rather than the physician. Unfortunately, however, Klingle&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_47">2004</xref>) and Burgoon, Birk, and Hall&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_9">1991</xref>) sources indicate that patient noncompliance is the most significant problem facing medicine today and that patient noncompliance is as high as 62 percent with prescribed drug regimens, 50 percent with medical appointment keeping, and 92 percent with health promotion and lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>For these reasons, researchers have attempted to determine not only what types of compliance-gaining strategies physicians use but also what types of strategies are the most effective. For example, a review of literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_11">Burgoon and Burgoon (1990)</xref> found that physicians prefer to use strategies that appeal to authority, knowledge, and expertise, and tend to avoid threatening and antisocial strategies. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_64">Schneider and Beaubien (1996)</xref> found that positive expertise, legitimacy, and liking (see strategies discussed earlier) accounted for 83.5 percent of all the compliance-gaining strategies used by doctors on patients. Physicians report that their strategies tend to become more verbally aggressive, however, when patients have not complied with previous requests and have more severe medical problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_11">Burgoon &#x0026; Burgoon, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to issues about strategy use, researchers have also tried to determine what types of strategies are most effective. Some research, for instance, has found that patients are more likely to comply with doctors who express similarity (i.e., indicate that they share things in common with the patient) and are more satisfied with doctors who communicate a willingness to listen, express affection, are composed, are similar, formal, and nondomineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_8">Burgoon, Pfau, Parrott, Birk, Coker, &#x0026; Burgoon, 1987</xref>). Some research suggests that there are gender differences in strategy effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_47">Klingle, 2004</xref>). Male doctors can get away with using more negative strategies than can female doctors. In addition, research indicates that both female and male doctors who vary their strategies are more effective than doctors who employ the same strategy repeatedly. Finally, in situations involving terminal illness, family members are more likely to consent to donating the patient&#x2019;s organs when compliance-gaining messages communicate additional emotional support to the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_1">Anker &#x0026; Feeley, 2011</xref>).</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>But how do we decide which strategies will have a positive emotional impact and which will have a negative emotional impact? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_37">Hunter and Boster (1987)</xref> argued that each of us has a perceptual &#x201C;threshold&#x201D; that helps us make decisions about what strategies are acceptable and what strategies are not. Threatening someone, for example, may exceed the threshold, whereas promising something may not. Strategies that do not cross the threshold are more likely to be used.</p>
<p>A major implication of this model, of course, is that these thresholds are idiosyncratic, varying from one person to the next. Biff, for example, may be perfectly comfortable threatening others, whereas Babbs may not. Obviously, then, individual differences are important in determining the types of compliance-gaining messages that are used. For that reason, considerable research has examined several &#x201C;sender&#x201D; characteristics that affect strategy choice. Some of these characteristics include Machiavellianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_57">O&#x2019;Hair &#x0026; Cody, 1987</xref>), dogmatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_63">Roloff &#x0026; Barnicott, 1979</xref>), self-monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_69">Smith, Cody, Lovette, &#x0026; Canary, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_70">Snyder, 1979</xref>), type A personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_49">Lamude &#x0026; Scudder, 1993</xref>), verbal aggressiveness and argumentativeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_5">Boster, Levine, &#x0026; Kazoleas, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_40">Infante, Trebing, Shepard, &#x0026; Seeds, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_39">Infante &#x0026; Wigley, 1986</xref>), gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_20">Dallinger &#x0026; Hample, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_23">deTurck &#x0026; Miller, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_28">Fitzpatrick &#x0026; Winke, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_33">Harris et al., 2014</xref>), culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_10">Burgoon, Dillard, Doran, &#x0026; Miller, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_35">Hirokawa &#x0026; Mirahara, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_51">Lu, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_66">Sellnow, Liu, &#x0026; Venette, 2006</xref>), and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_34">Haslett, 1983</xref>). Because many of these characteristics were detailed in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter5">Chapter 5</xref>, we use the rest of this section to discuss the work of O&#x2019;Keefe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_58">1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_59">1990</xref>), who argued that people produce different compliance-gaining messages because they think differently about communication. O&#x2019;Keefe called these different beliefs about communication <italic>design logics</italic> and argued that they are threefold:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Expressive design logic:</italic> A person with this design logic believes that communication is a process by which people merely express what they think and feel. Such people fail to realize that communication can be used to achieve other goals and, therefore, &#x201C;speak from the gut,&#x201D; dumping whatever they think and feel without any regard for what might be appropriate in a given situation. For that reason, such people&#x2019;s messages tend to be &#x201C;primitive.&#x201D; For instance, a person with an expressive design logic might say something like the following: &#x201C;You **&#x0023;&#x0023;*&#x0024;*&#x0040; jerk. You&#x2019;ve had it. I&#x2019;m going to get you fired for this!&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Conventional design logic:</italic> A person with this design logic believes that communication is a game played cooperatively, according to social conventions and procedures. Thus, people using this logic express their thoughts and feelings, but believe that they also must follow rules for appropriate social behavior in a given situation. For instance, a person with a conventional design logic might say something like the following: &#x201C;You missed our meeting today and I don&#x2019;t appreciate this irresponsibility. If you miss one more meeting, you&#x2019;re fired.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Rhetorical design logic:</italic> A person with a rhetorical design logic believes that communication&#x2019;s purpose is to negotiate character, attitude, selves, and situations. The process involves repeatedly solving and coordinating problems, consensus, and harmony. Thus, someone with this logic pursues multiple goals, tends to be proactive, and uses rational arguments. Here&#x2019;s an example:
<disp-quote>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_249">249</target>You have been coming back late from lunch and we need to reach some kind of understanding about this. I don&#x2019;t want to have to force you to follow the rules, but I will if I have to. But surely you can appreciate why we have rules and what function they serve. I know if you just think about the situation you will see how your behavior could be creating a problem in this office.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_58">O&#x2019;Keefe, 1988</xref>, p. 103)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Research has found that messages reflecting a rhetorical design logic are rated as more competent, favorable, and persuasive than messages reflecting the other design logics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_3">Bingham &#x0026; Burleson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_57">O&#x2019;Keefe &#x0026; McCornack, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_65">Scott, Caughlin, Donovan-Kicken, &#x0026; Mikucki-Enyart, 2013</xref>). What&#x2019;s more, compared to people with expressive design logics, those with rhetorical design logics feel more effective in their persuasive attempts. One study, for example, found that people with rhetorical design logics felt more confident that they could do or say something to intervene when they see others engaged in high-risk behavior (e.g., &#x201C;a guy&#x2013;girl hookup&#x201D; in which a drunk and reluctant female is heading toward a possible sexual encounter with a male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_74">White &#x0026; Malkowski, 2014</xref>)).</p>

<title>The Study of Compliance-Gaining Goals: Eyes on the Prize</title>
<p>In addition to creating typologies of compliance-gaining strategies, researchers have also examined the ways in which people&#x2019;s goals influence how they seek compliance. Simply defined, goals are states of affairs we want to attain or maintain often through persuasion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_75">Wilson, 1997</xref>). The following sections examine the ways in which goals are important when trying to understand compliance gaining.</p>
<sec id="sec10_5_1">
<title>How Goals Bring Meaning to Compliance-Gaining Situations: What&#x2019;s It All About, Alfie?</title>
<p>Years ago, one of the authors heard a story about two men scooping mud and straw into wooden molds.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A passerby asked one of the men what he was doing.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;Scooping mud and straw into this mold,&#x201D; the man told him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What are you doing?&#x201D; the passerby asked the second man, who seemed much happier than the first.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m part of a team making a beautiful cathedral,&#x201D; came the reply.</p>
</disp-quote>
</disp-quote>
<p>We like this story because it illustrates how goals can help people define situations. Clearly, the first man&#x2019;s goal (scooping mud) makes his situation seem dismal compared to the second man&#x2019;s. Our point here is that goals give meaning to situations, including situations that involve compliance gaining. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_76">Wilson and Kunkel (2000)</xref>, &#x201C;Individuals interpret compliance gaining episodes based on their <target target-type="page" id="page_250">250</target>understanding of specific influence goals&#x201D; (p. 197). In a summary of literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_45">Kellermann (2004)</xref> identified several common compliance-gaining goals that appear meaningful to people. These included goals to provide guidance; get advice, a favor, permission, or information; share time; initiate, escalate, or end a relationship; fulfill an obligation; get a date; change an opinion; and stop an annoying habit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_45">Kellermann, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>How might these different influence goals affect perceptions of a situation and, in turn, the ways in which compliance is sought? By way of example, imagine that you have two different influence goals. One is to ask someone a favor. The other is to get someone who owes you a favor to repay you in some way. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_13">Cai and Wilson (2000)</xref>, requests such as these create entirely different situations for persuaders and, as a result, may lead to different compliance-seeking behavior. Clearly, this notion relates to our earlier discussion of politeness and compliance gaining. For instance, because asking favors may impose on another person, when asking favors, you may be less direct, provide the target with a &#x201C;way out,&#x201D; and provide a lot of reasons for your imposition. However, if you&#x2019;re seeking compliance from someone who owes you a favor, you might be more direct and less polite in your compliance attempts, perhaps even making the target feel guilty if he or she does not comply.</p>
<p>Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_13">Cai and Wilson (2000)</xref> suggests that different types of requests, such as these, present similar concerns for persuaders in all cultures, though cultural differences may occur when making such requests. For instance, on one hand, asking a favor may lead you to feel indebted, regardless of your cultural background. On the other hand, because they are more concerned with saving face, people from Japan, compared to those from the United States, may worry more about imposing on others. As a result, the Japanese may be less direct and especially polite when seeking favors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_13">Cai &#x0026; Wilson, 2000</xref>). Moreover, because in-group favoritism is more prevalent in collectivistic, compared to individualistic cultures, managers from collectivistic cultures (e.g., China) may be more likely to use less polite tactics (e.g., threat) when influencing subordinates they perceive to be different from themselves (i.e., out-group members), and more likely to use pro-social tactics (e.g., ingratiation) when influencing in-group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_68">Sheer, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Primary and Secondary Goals: Wanting and Eating Your Cake</title>
<p>If we told you that the most effective strategy for getting something was to make threats, would you start threatening people every time you wanted something?
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;Loan me 20 bucks, or I&#x2019;ll break your nose!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;If you want to keep your job, get me some coffee!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Keep it up, and you can stand in the corner for the next hour.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let me get a tattoo, or I&#x2019;ll run away from home!&#x201D;</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We suspect that, for most of you, the answer to this question would be &#x201C;no.&#x201D; But why? If threats really were so effective, why not throw them around a little? Because, you might be thinking to yourself, if I made threats every time I wanted something, I might not have many friends. Plus, you probably wouldn&#x2019;t like yourself <target target-type="page" id="page_251">251</target>too much. And if the other party still refused, you might be forced to follow through with the threat.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we discussed several different types of influence goals. In this section, we note that influence goals are not the only ones affecting compliance gaining. Indeed, most of the time we are concerned with pursuing multiple goals at the same time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_44">Kellermann (1992)</xref>, for example, argued that when seeking compliance, people are constrained by concerns for both efficiency (achieving their goal without wasting time and other resources) and appropriateness (accomplishing their goal in a socially acceptable and respectful way). Similarly, in his <italic>goals&#x2013;plans&#x2013;action theory,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_25">James Dillard (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_26">2008</xref>) argues that people pursue different types of goals when they are trying to influence someone. These goals are important because they determine the types of strategies that people plan to use when trying to gain compliance. To identify these goals, Dillard and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_27">Dillard, Segrin, &#x0026; Harden, 1989</xref>) asked students to imagine themselves in a compliance-gaining situation and to state why they would or wouldn&#x2019;t use particular influence strategies in that situation. Results of the study indicated that one primary goal, to influence the other person, is the most important in determining the type of strategy that a person uses. For example, a person may decide not to use a strategy because he or she thinks it won&#x2019;t work or because it is irrelevant.</p>
<p>In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_26">Dillard (2008)</xref> identifies several secondary goals that influence people&#x2019;s choices in compliance-gaining situations. First, <italic>identity goals</italic> are concerned with maintaining one&#x2019;s moral standards and principles for living. Thus, people might decide to ignore a strategy that seems immoral. Second, <italic>interaction goals</italic> are concerned with creating a good impression and behaving in appropriate ways. For instance, people motivated by this goal might refuse to use a strategy that would make them look bad. Third, <italic>resource goals</italic> are concerned with maintaining a relationship and increasing personal rewards. Thus, using a strategy that would end a friendship would not be likely. Finally, <italic>arousal goals</italic> are concerned with maintaining levels of arousal (e.g., nervousness) within an acceptable range. Thus, people with this goal would not use a strategy that would make them too anxious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_26">Dillard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_27">Dillard et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the goals&#x2013;plans&#x2013;action theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_26">Dillard, 2008</xref>), then, primary and secondary goals have different degrees of compatibility. Based on the relationships among all the goals involved, a person develops <italic>plans</italic>, which are possible methods or approaches for dealing with the complex structure of goals. In order to generate and then put plans into action, people seeking compliance must consider possible strategies and tactics, which can be a complicated business. One study, for example, examined how people create messages aimed at persuading loved ones suffering from depression to seek professional help. Results indicated that, oftentimes, a focus on secondary goals (e.g., saving both parties&#x2019; face) led to the design of non-optimal messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_77">Wilson, Dorrance Hall, Gettings, &#x0026; Pastor, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, a number of variables might affect goals, plans, and actions in the process of seeking compliance. Consider, for example, relational certainty. It turns out that some people are far more certain than others when it comes to knowing whether they or their partners want to pursue a relationship. Given this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_48">Knobloch (2006)</xref> surmised that, when asking someone for a date, things would go more smoothly for people who experienced little relational ambiguity than for those who experienced <target target-type="page" id="page_252">252</target>a lot of it. Specifically, those with less certainty are more likely to worry about competing goals such as damaging a friendship. Not only that, when planning and using their compliance-gaining messages, uncertainty may make people less sure about what to say. It might also get in the way of them saying it effectively. To test these ideas, research participants were observed requesting hypothetical dates from people they were attracted to in real life. The participants were asked to leave phone messages, requesting dates from people they knew and were attracted to. Some were more certain about their relationships than others. Results of the study confirmed the researcher&#x2019;s suspicions: Relational certainty was associated with requests for dates that were judged to be more fluent, affiliative, and effective. Here are two examples of requests from the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_48">Knobloch, 2006</xref>, p. 273). We hope it is obvious which was produced by the person with more relational certainty:
<disp-quote>
<p>&#x201C;Hey babe, it&#x2019;s Kevin. I was just calling to see if you had any plans tonight, &#x2019;cause I wondered if I could take you out to dinner or something. So, just give me a call whenever you get the message. Bye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hey, Emily, uh, this is Bob. Um, yeah, just wondering what you were up to tonight. Uh, haven&#x2019;t talked to you in &#x2026; in a little while, so, uh, yeah, I think there&#x2019;s some stuff we need to talk about. So, um, if I don&#x2019;t end up talking to you, I guess I&#x2019;ll talk to you on the Internet later. We&#x2019;ll see ya.&#x201D;</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In short, then, compliance-gaining situations are not as simple as they may seem. People not only generate and select tactics that they think will help them gain compliance but do so in the face of multiple constraints, including competing goals and other factors.</p>

<title>Problems Facing Compliance Research: Trouble in Paradise</title>
<p>Up to this point, the things we have said about compliance gaining probably seem fairly simple; when trying to persuade people, we have a number of strategies at our disposal, and the strategies we use are determined in part by the situation, our personal characteristics, and our goals. Despite this rather straightforward description, however, there has been a lot of confusion and argument about research methods that have been used to draw such conclusions. Without straying too far into the weeds, we believe it is important to mention at least a couple of concerns here.</p>
<p>To illustrate one issue, imagine that you could listen to any song right now. What would it be? Can you think of three songs? Your choice of songs is open ended. Depending on how much music you listen to, coming up with your three favorites off the top of your head might not be all that easy. Now imagine you are on iTunes and looking at a list of the top 20 songs, from which you must pick 3. Your choice of songs is limited.</p>
<p>What does all of this have to do with compliance-gaining research? If you stop to think about it, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_52">Marwell and Schmitt (1967)</xref> study we discussed earlier is not entirely different from our iTunes example. Only, instead of asking their research participants to select from a list of song titles, Marwell and Schmitt asked people to select from a list of pre-established compliance-seeking strategies. The problems with <target target-type="page" id="page_253">253</target>such an approach, however, have been pointed out by numerous researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_17">Cody, McLaughlin, &#x0026; Jordan, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_78">Wiseman &#x0026; Schenck-Hamlin, 1981</xref>). First, by way of illustration, let&#x2019;s return to the iTunes example. Let&#x2019;s say your favorite Beyonc&#x00E9; song did not appear on the list, so you settle for a song by Rihanna instead. Obviously, your choice has been constrained by the songs that are on the top 20 list. You can&#x2019;t pick a song that&#x2019;s not available. Researchers who provide their subjects with lists of compliance-gaining strategies constrain their subjects&#x2019; choices in the same way. You can&#x2019;t pick a strategy if it isn&#x2019;t on the list.</p>
<p>Second, imagine you notice a song that you hadn&#x2019;t remembered but would have selected had it come to mind. In other words, seeing the song title made you more likely to choose it. In the same way, strategies selected from a list can artificially &#x201C;cue&#x201D; participants. When participating in a study, it&#x2019;s possible that we see a strategy on a list and think, &#x201C;Oh yeah, that seems like a good one.&#x201D; But in real life, the strategy would not have occurred to us. Thus, the list makes some strategies seem more popular than they truly are.</p>
<p>Finally, imagine you hate country music but are with a group of friends who love the stuff. To fit in, you download some Carrie Underwood tunes. Researchers have argued that the same type of thing can happen when participating in research. Specifically, in order to &#x201C;fit in&#x201D; or &#x201C;look good,&#x201D; we may not report what we would do in real life but rather what makes us look the most socially desirable. Thus, although Astrid may go around threatening people in real life, she may tell researchers that she uses more prosocial compliance-gaining tactics. Having a list of tactics to choose from may make this <italic>social desirability bias</italic> more likely to occur.</p>
<p>In an attempt to overcome these problems, some researchers have scrapped &#x201C;selection&#x201D; in favor of &#x201C;construction&#x201D; procedures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_78">Wiseman &#x0026; Schenck-Hamlin, 1981</xref>). The argument goes like this: If people are presented with a situation requiring persuasion and are asked to describe the strategy they would use (i.e., construct the strategy from scratch rather than select it from a list), the strategy will better reflect true behavior, not misrepresent strategies that are not typically used, and be less prone to social desirability bias.</p>
<p>As neat as this sounds, research indicates little difference in the results of studies using these two techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_4">Boster, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_62">Plax, Kearney, &#x0026; Sorensen, 1990</xref>). What may be of even greater importance, though, are the findings of a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_24">Dillard (1988)</xref>. To determine which of several methods for assessing compliance-gaining behavior was the best,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Dillard asked people to rate, on paper, how likely they would be to use 16 different compliance-gaining messages in persuasive situations. He then observed these people in actual compliance-gaining situations but found that, regardless of the method he used to assess compliance-gaining behavior, there was no correspondence between the paper&#x2013;pencil measures and actual behavior. In other words, what people <italic>said</italic> they would do was not the same as what they actually <italic>did.</italic></p>
<p>When we consider the implications of this study, it reminds us of a story we once heard about a man who exits a cab late at night and sees a drunk on his hands and knees, snooping around a street light. The man asks, &#x201C;Is anything wrong?&#x201D; to which the drunk replies, &#x201C;Yeah, I lost my keys.&#x201D; The man says, &#x201C;Did you lose them here?&#x201D; The drunk answers, &#x201C;Naw, I lost them over there in the dark, but the light is much better here.&#x201D; In the same vein, Dillard&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_24">1988</xref>) study illustrates that investigators have been looking very hard at compliance gaining, but perhaps not in the right way. <target target-type="page" id="page_254">254</target>Rather than examining compliance gaining in artificial laboratory settings using hypothetical situations or paper&#x2013;pencil measures, investigators should look for compliance gaining as it occurs in more naturalistic contexts, a topic we discuss next.</p>

<sec id="sec10_7">
<title>Compliance Gaining in Action: Seeing is Believing</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_16">Robert Cialdini (2016)</xref>, one of our favorite persuasion researchers, describes himself this way:
<disp-quote>
<p>As a kind of secret agent, I once infiltrated the training programs of a broad range of professions dedicated to getting us to say yes. For almost three years, I recorded the lessons taught to aspiring automobile salespeople, direct marketers, TV advertisers, frontline managers, charity fund-raisers, public relations specialists, and corporate recruiters. My intent was to find out which practices worked time after time. So I answered the organizations&#x2019; ads for trainees or otherwise arranged to be present in their classrooms, notebook in hand, ready to absorb the wisdom born of long-standing experience in the business of persuasion.</p>
<attrib>(p. 3)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In other words, Cialdini observed compliance gaining as it occurs in &#x201C;real life,&#x201D; and as a result, developed a &#x201C;typology&#x201D; of seven underlying principles of social influence that professional persuaders rely on to be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_15">Cialdini, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_16">2016</xref>). Because other chapters have or will discuss these principles, here we provide quick glimpses of each one.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The principle of <italic>reciprocity</italic> suggests that we should repay, in some form or another, what other people have given us. As such, when people do us a favor, give us a gift, or provide advice, we feel indebted. As a result, we&#x2019;re more likely to comply with their requests (also see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter11">Chapter 11</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The principle of <italic>scarcity</italic> states that when objects or opportunities are in short supply, we value them more (think gold versus dirt here). As such, when something is a &#x201C;limited edition&#x201D; or on sale for a &#x201C;limited time,&#x201D; you might be persuaded to buy it (also see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter8">Chapter 8</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The principle of <italic>consistency/commitment</italic> says that the more you become committed to an idea, the more likely you&#x2019;ll be to behave consistently with it.

<p>In this chapter, we focused on the study of compliance gaining. Early research in this area attempted to discover the different types of strategies that people use to get others to behave in certain ways. Research also focused on the ways in which situations, individual characteristics, and goals affect the use and selection of compliance-gaining strategies. We also discussed how compliance-gaining research has been plagued by several problems. Finally, we examined several underlying principles of compliance that were identified through observing compliance in &#x201C;real-life&#x201D; interactions.</p>

<fn id="fn10_1"><label>1</label><p>Three prior methods have been used to assess compliance-gaining behavior, each using a different dependent variable. First, the technique approach treats each individual compliance-gaining tactic as a separate, dependent variable and assumes that the correspondence between selected tactics (selected from a checklist) and used tactics will be high. Second, the strategy approach treats groups of tactics as dependent variables and assumes that correspondence between strategy choice and use will be high. Finally, the summed-tactic approach argues that a single, dependent variable is indicative of some global compliance-gaining attempt and assumes that the summed-tactic-selection score will correspond to the frequency of compliance-gaining messages (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10_24">Dillard, 1988</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>&#x201C;IF YOU&#x2019;RE A DOOR-TO-DOOR salesperson,&#x201D; we&#x2019;re told by a friend who once made his living selling encyclopedias, &#x201C;half your job is getting into people&#x2019;s houses. Once you&#x2019;re inside,&#x201D; he informed us, &#x201C;they&#x2019;re yours, all yours.&#x201D;</p>
<p>According to our friend, most door-to-door salespeople have sneaky ways of getting their feet into your doorway. Some mention your neighbors by name. Some ask for a glass of water. Our pal had a whole spiel based largely on deception. He&#x2019;s not proud of it now, he admitted, but when he greeted customers, he was trained to look like anything but a salesperson.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_261">261</target>&#x201C;After introducing myself,&#x201D; he told us, &#x201C;I promised I was not going to try to sell them anything. I was just in the neighborhood conducting surveys. I asked them if they would give me their opinions about their family&#x2019;s educational needs and told them that, if they did, I would repay them with &#x2018;educational materials.&#x2019; That usually got me inside.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Once our friend was in the door, he asked his customers to respond to a phony &#x201C;opinion survey&#x201D; (e.g., &#x201C;Do your kids use the library?&#x201D; &#x201C;Do your kids go to the library after dark?&#x201D;) and then showed them a set of encyclopedias that he was &#x201C;willing to give them, for promotional reasons, if they promised to keep the set up to date.&#x201D; How could they do that? Simply by purchasing one yearbook per year for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Many of the customers agreed to this seemingly unbelievable offer. What they did not realize was that the amount of money they paid for the yearbooks actually covered the cost of the encyclopedias and then some. They&#x2019;d been &#x201C;schmoozed&#x201D; into buying something they thought they were getting for free.</p>
<p>This example, together with the strategies discussed in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter9">Chapter 9</xref>, shows that oftentimes persuasion is not as simple as making a single request or giving one speech. Persuasion, quite frequently, is a process that requires a number of steps. Indeed, before making his pitch, our friend had to get himself into the customer&#x2019;s house. And for reasons we discuss later, by getting customers to agree to the survey, our friend probably increased his chances of making a sale.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we extend concepts from <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter9">Chapter 9</xref> by discussing the topic of &#x201C;sequential persuasion,&#x201D; which examines social influence as a &#x201C;multi-step&#x201D; process. Similarly, this chapter extends concepts from <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter10">Chapter 10</xref> because sequential persuasion, for the most part, encompasses a number of tactics that are aimed at gaining compliance (i.e., getting people to behave in a particular way). We explore research that shows how people increase their persuasiveness, often at the expense of others, by saying or doing something before, or sometimes after, making their request. We begin with a strategy known as <italic>pregiving.</italic></p>
<sec id="sec11_1">
<title>Pregiving: The Old &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll-Scratch-Your-Back-if-you&#x2019;ll-Scratch-Mine&#x201D; Approach</title>
<p>Many years ago, when most cameras still used film, one of the authors received a package in the mail. The package contained two unused rolls of film and a letter explaining that the film was a gift. The letter went on to explain how, after using the film, the author could mail it to the company to be processed. And the funny thing is, the author did, even though the cost of the processing was more expensive than taking the film to a local developer. Why was the author persuaded to spend more money? Because the ploy used by the processing company is a well-known and effective tactic of persuasion known as pregiving. <italic>Pregiving</italic> entails trying to get someone to comply by doing favors or giving gifts in advance. When supermarkets offer free samples of foods to taste, they are employing this strategy. And when service personnel are especially helpful (e.g., a food server boxes leftovers for you), they are using this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_77">Seiter &#x0026; Weger, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>A classic study done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_74">Dennis Regan (1971)</xref> showed how effective the pregiving strategy can be. In the study, first-year students at Stanford University who had been <target target-type="page" id="page_262">262</target>asked to participate in an experiment on &#x201C;aesthetics&#x201D; were seated in a room with another student. What the students had not been told was that the other student was a confederate who had been planted there by the researcher. After a few minutes, the confederate left the room. When he returned, he was either empty-handed or was carrying two Coca-Colas. If he was empty-handed, he simply sat back down. But if he had sodas, he offered one to the research subject and said, &#x201C;I bought one for you too.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Seems nice enough, but there&#x2019;s a catch; later, the plant informed the subject that he was selling raffle tickets for a new high school gym and would appreciate it if the subject would do him a favor by buying some tickets. Not surprisingly, the results of the study revealed that subjects who had been given a soda ahead of time bought almost twice as many raffle tickets as those who had been given nothing.</p>
<p>Real-world persuaders are also known to put the pregiving tactic to use. For example, in touristy areas of big cities (the Louvre in Paris, the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, the Alamo in San Antonio, the Parthenon in Athens), panhandlers have figured out a tricky way to get donations from unsuspecting tourists. The panhandlers wait a block or two from a well-known tourist attraction. When tourists walk by, clearly headed for the attraction, the panhandlers catch up with them, walk in stride, and proceed to &#x201C;guide&#x201D; the tourists to their destination. Once there, the panhandlers ask for a donation for the unrequested and unneeded service rendered.</p>
<p>The pregiving tactic works in other contexts as well. For instance, as a suit salesperson, one of the authors was trained to ask customers if they would like to have their jackets pressed while they were shopping. Very few refused the favor, and even those who did were cheerfully surprised at the offer. What they did not understand was that there was a hidden rationale behind the gesture; not only was it an effective means of getting customers to spend more time shopping, but when it came to purchasing a suit, who better to buy from than the nice salesperson who had already done them a favor?</p>
<p>Two final examples of the pregiving strategy are, to us, perhaps the most disturbing. First, the next time a man asks if he can buy you a drink, women beware; a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_41">George, Gournic, and McAfee (1988)</xref> found that if women allow men to buy them drinks, both men and women perceive the women to be more sexually available than if the drinks are refused.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> Second, in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_57">Happ, Melzer, &#x0026; Steffgen, 2016</xref>), experimenters posing as interviewers gave passersby a free package of chocolates before asking them to divulge confidential information such as computer passwords. Remarkably, 47.9 percent of participants revealed their passwords to complete strangers. That&#x2019;s compared to the (still remarkable) 29.8 percent who did the same without the incentive. Bottom line? That old warning&#x2014;&#x201C;never take candy from strangers&#x201D;&#x2014;is worth paying attention to.</p>
<sec id="sec11_1_1">
<title>Why Is the Pregiving Tactic Persuasive?</title>
<p>Common explanations for why pregiving works or doesn&#x2019;t work include liking, physical attraction, perceived ulterior motives, gratitude, impression management, and internalized social norms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_12">Burger, Sanchez, Imberi, &#x0026; Grande, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_42">Goei, Roberto, Meyer, &#x0026; Carlyle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_58">Hendrickson &#x0026; Goei, 2009</xref>). The <italic>liking explanation</italic> suggests that people who do or give something are perceived as kind and good. As a result, they are well liked, and, in turn, more persuasive. Similarly, <target target-type="page" id="page_263">263</target>the <italic>physical attraction explanation</italic> suggests that doing favors leads people to be seen as more attractive, which, in turn, leads them to be more persuasive. The <italic>perceived ulterior motives explanation</italic> suggests that when a favor is seen as a tool of manipulation, it is less likely to lead to compliance. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_48">Groves, Cialdini, and Couper (1992)</xref> argued that pregiving actually decreases compliance when it is perceived as a bribe or a pressure tactic. The <italic>gratitude explanation</italic> suggests that receiving a favor leads to positive emotional states (i.e., feelings of gratitude) that motivate benevolent behavior. In other words, people comply because the favor creates a spirit of thankfulness and benevolence. The last two explanations, <italic>impression management</italic> and <italic>internalized social norm</italic>, are based on <italic>the norm of reciprocity</italic> (or <italic>indebtedness</italic>), which, if you recall from <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter10">Chapter 10</xref>, states that it is desirable to repay what another person has provided us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_21">Cialdini &#x0026; Goldstein, 2004</xref>). More specifically, the impression management explanation suggests that repaying favors is desirable because it keeps you from looking like an ungrateful freeloader. The internalized social norm explanation suggests that repaying favors is desirable because it makes people feel good about themselves when they do the right thing.</p>
<p>Although all of these explanations have received support, the studies that test them side by side favor some explanations over others. For example, in a study by Burger and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_12">2009</xref>), after receiving or not receiving a favor (an unexpected bottled water), research participants were asked to complete and return a survey. Half the participants were told that the person who had done them the favor would be collecting the surveys personally, while the other half were told that they could leave the surveys in a clearly labeled drop-off box. Results indicated that participants who had received the favor were more likely to complete the surveys regardless of how they returned the surveys. This, of course, supported the internalized social norm explanation over the impression management explanation. To be sure, who cares about impressing a drop-off box?</p>
<p>A second study conducted by Goei and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_42">Goei et al., 2007</xref>) tested the liking, gratitude, and indebtedness explanations. Support was found for the liking and gratitude explanations but depended on whether the person seeking compliance benefited from gaining compliance. Specifically, when the person doing a favor was seeking compliance for something that would personally benefit him or her (e.g., the person could win &#x0024;50 by selling a lot of raffle tickets), the gratitude explanation was superior. If, however, the person doing the favor did not personally benefit from compliance (e.g., he or she was selling raffle tickets for a good cause), the liking explanation was superior.</p>
<p>Finally, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_58">Hendrickson and Goei (2009)</xref> found support for the gratitude, liking, and physical attraction explanations, at least when a favor was done by a person of low status. Regardless of which explanation holds true in a given situation, pregiving is a robust strategy that works well across cultures and persuasive contexts.</p>

<title>Foot in the Door: The &#x201C;Give-Me-An-Inch-And-I&#x2019;ll-Take-A-Mile&#x201D; Tactic</title>
<p>Some time ago, one of the authors and a friend were leaving a shopping mall when they were approached by a woman. She was about 30 years old, nicely dressed, and had a small child with her.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_264">264</target>&#x201C;Excuse me,&#x201D; she said to the author, &#x201C;would you please tell me what time it is?&#x201D; The author obliged.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was wondering if you could also spare a few dollars?&#x201D; the woman added. She claimed that her car had run out of gas, she had forgotten her purse, and, if the author would give her his address, she would be happy to return the money to him.</p>
<p>Once again, the author obliged, giving her three or four dollars. He never heard from the woman again. The author&#x2019;s friend, however, saw the same woman several weeks later, using the same scam but at a different mall.</p>
<p>In retrospect, there were probably several things that made the woman successful in her attempt to gain compliance. The fact that she was well dressed made her story seem more believable. She gave a plausible reason for needing the money. And having a small child with her probably created more sympathy. Interestingly, however, having nice clothes, good reasons, and a small child may not have been the only keys to her success. A considerable amount of research shows that the woman might have increased her chances of compliance by asking for the time <italic>before</italic> she asked for money (hmm, maybe there is a good reason then for not giving a stranger &#x201C;the time of day&#x201D;).</p>
<p>The tactic we have just described is often referred to as the <italic>foot-in-the-door strategy,</italic> hereafter called FITD. The tactic involves making a small request first and then making a second, larger request. Of course, it is the second, larger request that most interests the persuader. The first, small request is merely a setup. For instance, the encyclopedia salesperson we talked about earlier used this tactic when he asked people if they would answer a short survey before he asked for a sale. He didn&#x2019;t really care about their responses to the survey; he simply wanted to soften them up. For reasons we discuss later, when people comply with a smaller request, it often makes them more likely to comply with a second, larger request.</p>
<p>The first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FITD strategy was conducted by Jonathan Freedman and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_40">Scott Fraser (1966)</xref> at Stanford University. These researchers were interested in finding out if they could get housewives to agree to a very large request. Specifically, they asked housewives to allow a team of five or six men into their homes for two hours. The men, they were told, would have complete freedom in the house to go through the cupboards and storage spaces in order to classify all of the household products that were there. Before being approached with this request, however, some of the women were set up with a smaller initial request. That is, three days before making the large request, the researchers called some of the housewives and asked if they would participate in a survey about household products (e.g., &#x201C;What brand of soap do you use?&#x201D;). Surprisingly, about 50 percent of the housewives who agreed to answer the survey also agreed to let complete strangers rifle through their houses. However, when the researchers had not approached housewives with a smaller request first, only about 25 percent of the housewives agreed to the subsequent larger request (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_40">Freedman &#x0026; Fraser, 1966</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec11_2_1">
<title>Why Is a Foot in the Door So Persuasive?</title>
<p>The FITD tactic appears to be a robust tactic that is effective given the right conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_7">Burger, 1999</xref>). But what makes it so persuasive? The most common explanation for the effectiveness of the FITD tactic is based on Bem&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_2">1972</xref>) <italic>self-perception theory</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_28">DeJong, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_40">Freedman &#x0026; Fraser, 1966</xref>). According to this <target target-type="page" id="page_265">265</target>theory, people come to know about their attitudes, emotions, and other internal states by inferring them from their own behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_2">Bem, 1972</xref>). For example, if you notice yourself eating a lot of Nutrageous candy bars, you are likely to come to the conclusion that you have a favorable attitude toward chocolate. In other words, you use your behavior to infer your attitude.</p>
<p>As an explanation for the FITD effect, self-perception theory says this: When you agree to comply with a small request, you see yourself as an altruistic person who is likely to help. Once you form that impression, you are motivated to behave in a manner consistent with that impression. Thus, when a larger request is made, you are more likely to comply.</p>
<p>Although some research points to the viability of self-perception theory as an explanation for the effectiveness of the FITD tactic, other evidence is not so optimistic. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_47">Gorassini and Olson (1995)</xref> conducted a study that measured how helpful people perceived themselves to be after complying with a first, small request. They found that although people&#x2019;s self-ratings of helpfulness were affected by compliance with the small request, those changes did not always predict people&#x2019;s compliance with a second, larger request. Moreover, compliance with a second, larger request often occurred without people perceiving themselves as being more helpful. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_29">Dillard (1990)</xref> argued that results of studies such as these show that more theorizing about the FITD tactic is necessary.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_7">Burger (1999)</xref>, however, suggests that self-perception <italic>does</italic> affect how much people comply with FITD requests. All research may not indicate this, however, because self-perception is probably not the only process involved. Specifically, Burger noted that other psychological processes operating in an FITD situation may overwhelm whatever impact self-perception has. As a result, not all studies will support a self-perception account of the FITD&#x2019;s effectiveness. By way of example, people may be less willing to comply with a request if they think most other people would reject the request. Thus, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_7">Burger (1999)</xref> notes, &#x201C;it appears that whatever push self-perception gives toward agreement with the target request can be overwhelmed by telling the individual that few people go along with such requests&#x201D; (p. 323). In short, self-perception probably plays a role in the FITD&#x2019;s effectiveness, but the tactic&#x2019;s success depends on a lot of other factors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_21">Cialdini &#x0026; Goldstein, 2004</xref>). We discuss some of these next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11_2_2">
<title>When Does a Foot in the Door Work?</title>
<p>Research tells us that some of the following conditions play an important role in determining the effectiveness of the FITD tactic:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Size of the initial request.</italic> Is getting a person to comply with any request enough to get the person to comply with later requests? Research shows that the initial request should be neither too large nor too small. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_78">Seligman, Bush, and Kirsch (1976)</xref> argued that &#x201C;the first request must be of sufficient size for the foot in the door technique to work&#x201D; (p. 519). However, the initial request cannot be so large that it is rejected. Thus, the persuader must strike a balance between making a large enough initial request to trigger the FITD effect but not so large that it is declined. For instance, asking for a penny so you might later get a larger donation probably would not work because the penny might be perceived as <target target-type="page" id="page_266">266</target>inconsequential. However, asking the average person for &#x0024;1,000 to begin with might be a reach. In short, the persuader wants to use the largest possible request that will be accepted.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Prosocialness of the request.</italic> In a review of several studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_30">Dillard, Hunter, and Burgoon (1984)</xref> found that the FITD tactic is more effective when used for prosocial causes than it is when used for self-serving reasons. With this in mind, the FITD tactic would probably be more useful to social workers trying to raise money to help the homeless than it would be for commissioned salespeople.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>External incentives to comply.</italic> Meta-analyses by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_7">Burger (1999)</xref> and Dillard and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_30">1984</xref>) indicated that people are less susceptible to the FITD tactic if they are offered external incentives for complying with the first request. Most researchers use self-perception theory to explain these effects. For example, if you received a gift for agreeing to listen to a timeshare sales pitch, you would not form an impression of yourself as someone who is willing to comply readily with requests. You are only complying because you have a material reason for doing so. Thus, because the pregiving strategy (discussed earlier) uses external incentives, it may not be a good idea to use it and the FITD strategies together (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_1">Bell, Cholerton, Fraczek, Rohlfs, &#x0026; Smith, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_82">Weyant, 1996</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Who makes the requests.</italic> For the FITD strategy to work, the same person needn&#x2019;t make both the initial and the follow-up requests. Indeed, it is often the case that a person who complies with a request by one person will also comply with a second request, even when the second request is made by a different person. In fact, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_18">Chartrand, Pinckert, and Burger (1999)</xref> found that when a different person made the second request, compliance was more likely than when the same person made both requests. This was especially true when there was no time delay between the first and second requests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_18">Chartrand et al., 1999</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Labeling.</italic> Imagine that just after you donated blood to the Red Cross, a nurse tells you how generous you are and thanks you. Or better yet, imagine that the nurse gives you a pin or bumper sticker that says, &#x201C;I Care Enough to Donate Blood.&#x201D; A review of studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_7">Burger (1999)</xref> reported that this type of labeling increases the odds that you will comply with larger follow-up requests (e.g., to donate blood every month for a year). This finding, of course, is consistent with self-perception theory&#x2014;that is, if someone labels you as someone who is helpful, you may begin to see yourself that way and, as a result, act in accordance with your self-perception.

This is especially true if the two requests are similar (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_7">Burger, 1999</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_25">Cialdini, Trost, and Newsom (1995)</xref>, some people have a greater need for such consistency than others.

<caption><title>I&#x2019;m So Hungry I Could Eat a Horse: The Darker Side of Labeling</title></caption>
<p>Up to now, we&#x2019;ve seen that labeling people in a positive way (&#x201C;you&#x2019;re so helpful!&#x201D;) may lead them to perceive themselves in a positive way, which, in turn, may make them more likely to comply with requests for help. But what do you suppose would happen if people were labeled in a negative way? Is it possible that they would be more likely to comply with requests for help in order to restore their damaged self-esteem? A study by Nicolas Gu&#x00E9;guen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_50">2001</xref>) tested this possibility in a devilish way. More than 100 pedestrians on a busy street in France were approached individually by three women who were part of the study. The first woman asked each unsuspecting target, &#x201C;Excuse me &#x2026;, my bag is heavy and I would like to buy a magazine. &#x2026; Would you mind keeping an eye on my bag while I go and get it?&#x201D; (p. 745). If the pedestrians agreed, they were left with a bag, which contained a package on top labeled &#x201C;Horse meat.&#x201D; Twenty seconds later, half of the pedestrians were approached by the second woman, who looked at the bag and said, &#x201C;It is really appalling to eat horse meat. When I think that it is thanks to the horse that we have evolved so much. You should be ashamed.&#x201D; (p. 745). Without waiting, the second woman left, the first woman returned with her magazine, thanked the pedestrians, and left with her bag of meat. Finally, the third woman approached the pedestrians and asked one of two things. Half of the pedestrians were asked to sign a petition favoring the proper treatment by the government of abandoned animals. The other half were asked to sign a petition favoring the limitation of traffic in the city center. Results of the study showed that pedestrians who received the negative label were significantly more likely to sign the petition, but only if asked to sign the petition about the treatment of animals. This, of course, makes sense: Having been shamed for eating pony parts, the second petition allowed pedestrians to buck the negative label and declare their unbridled love for horses.</p>

<title>The Door-In-The-Face Tactic: &#x201C;Ask for the Stars&#x201D;</title>
<p>One of our students used to work selling jewelry in a large department store. She tells us that her approach to sales was very different from that of the other salespeople with whom she worked. Most of them, she tells us, started by showing their customers the &#x201C;bottom of the line&#x201D; merchandise. To increase their sales, they then moved to more expensive merchandise, demonstrating that &#x201C;more money&#x201D; meant &#x201C;higher quality.&#x201D; However, our student started by showing her customers the most expensive merchandise first. Typically, they did not purchase what they were <target target-type="page" id="page_268">268</target>first shown but, even so, our student claims that while she worked at that store, her sales were always higher than anyone else&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>Actually, we are not surprised by our student&#x2019;s success as a salesperson. Whether she knew it or not, she was using a tactic of persuasion that researchers have known to be effective for many years. Often called the <italic>door-in-the-face technique,</italic> or DITF, this tactic is just the opposite of the FITD strategy. It works by first making a request so large that it is turned down, then following it up with a second, smaller request. Of course, just as with the FITD tactic, compliance with the second request is what the persuader has been aiming for all along.</p>
<p>The first empirical study of the DITF tactic was conducted by Robert Cialdini and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_26">Cialdini et al., 1975</xref>). To visualize the study, imagine what you would do if someone approached you, identified herself as a representative of a youth-counseling program, and asked if you&#x2019;d be willing to chaperone a group of juvenile delinquents on a one day visit to the zoo. If you were like most of the people in the study (83 percent), you would refuse the request. It turns out, however, that people were much more responsive to the request if something happened beforehand. Specifically, when people were asked to volunteer two hours per week counseling juvenile delinquents for a minimum of two years, and then asked to chaperone the delinquents on the zoo trip, they were three times more likely to serve as chaperons. In other words, people were more likely to do a smaller favor (zoo chaperon) after refusing to do a large favor (counseling twice a week for up to two years) first.</p>
<p>Since the 1975 study of Cialdini and colleagues, the effectiveness of the DITF tactic has been demonstrated again and again (see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_22">Cialdini &#x0026; Guadagno, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_30">Dillard et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_37">Feeley, Anker, &#x0026; Aloe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_38">Feeley, Fico, Shaw, Lee, &#x0026; Griffin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_39">Fern, Monroe, &#x0026; Avila, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_68">O&#x2019;Keefe &#x0026; Hale, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_69">2001</xref>). But rather than examine those studies, we turn now to a discussion of <italic>why</italic> the DITF tactic is thought to be so effective.</p>
<sec id="sec11_3_1">
<title>Why Is a Door in the Face So Persuasive?</title>
<p>A number of explanations for the persuasiveness of the DITF tactic have been proposed and tested, with some faring better than others.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>The perceptual contrast effect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_19">Cialdini, 1993</xref>) suggests that people are likely to comply with a second, smaller request because, compared to the initial, larger request, the second request seems much smaller than it normally would have (e.g., a &#x0024;500 diamond ring seems inexpensive compared to the &#x0024;3,000 rings but expensive compared to the &#x0024;100 rings).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The <italic>self-presentation explanation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_71">Pendleton &#x0026; Batson, 1979</xref>) suggests that when people reject an initial request, they become concerned that they will be perceived negatively and thus comply with a second request in order to make themselves look better.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Reciprocal concessions</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_26">Cialdini et al., 1975</xref>) suggests that, when a persuader employing the DITF tactic makes a concession by following up with a smaller request, we may be motivated to reciprocate the favor by complying with the second request.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The legitimacy explanation</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_38">Feeley et al., 2017</xref>) suggests that making concessions can signal that a persuader has a greater need for compliance <target target-type="page" id="page_269">269</target>(i.e., the persuader is making a genuine request), which, in turn, engenders a greater obligation to help the persuader.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The <italic>guilt-based account</italic> (O&#x2019;Keefe &#x0026; Figg&#x00E9;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_67">1997</xref>) argues that refusing an initial, prosocial request leads persuadees to experience guilt, which they attempt to reduce by agreeing to a second request.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The <italic>social responsibility position</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_81">Tusing &#x0026; Dillard, 2000</xref>) suggests that we think it is socially responsible to help people who deserve it. As such, we&#x2019;re more likely to comply when follow-up messages ask for our help.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Based on analyses of multiple experiments, the social responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_37">Feeley et al., 2012</xref>) and reciprocal concessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_38">Feeley et al., 2017</xref>) explanations have found the most support. That said, according to Feeley and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_38">2017</xref>), perceptual contrast, guilt, and the legitimacy of requests probably contribute to the tactic&#x2019;s effectiveness.</p>

<p>Research tells us that some of the following conditions play an important role in determining the effectiveness of the DITF tactic:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Size of the initial request.</italic> For the DITF strategy to work, the first request must be large enough to guarantee rejection by the persuadee but not so large as to appear incredible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_26">Cialdini et al., 1975</xref>). But is there a right size for the initial request? A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_36">Even-Chen, Yinon, and Bizman (1978)</xref> addressed this question and concluded that the initial request must be large for the door in the face to work. However, they noted that the request must not be so large that it evokes anger, resentment, or incredulity in the persuadee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_36">Even-Chen et al., 1978</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Type of compliance sought.</italic> A meta-analysis by Feeley and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_37">2012</xref>) found that the DITF tactic is not effective when used for self-serving reasons but can increase compliance when used for altruistic purposes. Moreover, the tactic works better when seeking volunteers (e.g., to participate in research) than when seeking monetary donations, and for obtaining verbal, rather than behavioral, compliance. Finally, the DITF tactic is more effective than a single request when compliance is more difficult to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_37">Feeley et al., 2012</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><target target-type="page" id="page_270">270</target><italic>Elapsed time between first and second requests.</italic> Several reviews of studies on the DITF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_30">Dillard et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_37">Feeley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_39">Fern et al., 1986</xref>) argue that compliance is increased when the delay between the two requests is short. By way of example, Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_53">Jacob, and Meineri (2011)</xref> found that restaurant patrons who had refused invitations to order dessert were likely to accept invitations to order tea or coffee, especially when the follow-up invitation occurred immediately after the refusal rather than three minutes later.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Can a different person make the second request?</italic> Researchers who support the reciprocal concessions explanation (discussed earlier) like to point out that the DITF strategy does not work if the first and second requests are made by different people. Indeed, if a door-to-door salesperson offers you a vacuum cleaner for &#x0024;500, and a different salesperson offers you the appliance for &#x0024;300, you might perceive a contrast but not a concession. However, if the same salesperson made both offers, you might be more likely to reciprocate the concession and comply with the second offer.</p></list-item>

<title>The That&#x2019;s-Not-All Tactic: Seeking Compliance by Sweetening the Deal</title>
<p>Remember our friend who sold encyclopedias? We began the chapter by telling you how he used to weasel his way into houses with the foot-in-the-door tactic. But that&#x2019;s not all he did to sell his books. He also used what he calls the &#x201C;but wait, that&#x2019;s-not-all&#x201D; strategy. Here&#x2019;s how it worked: After presenting the books and before asking for the sale, he showed his customers several other items they could receive for free (an atlas, a dictionary, a thesaurus) <italic>if</italic> they agreed to buy the encyclopedias. Perhaps you&#x2019;ve observed this strategy used in other contexts. For instance, haven&#x2019;t we all seen those commercials for food and vegetable slicers and dicers? Typically, after a demonstration, you&#x2019;re asked, &#x201C;How much would you pay for this?&#x201D; Then you&#x2019;re presented with an add-on knife. How much would you pay now? How about if a carrot cleaner were added? Well, you get the idea, so &#x201C;call now!&#x201D;</p>
<p>To see whether this tactic was effective, Jerry Burger (1896) conducted several studies. In one, the tactic was used on customers at a bake sale. When customers asked about the price of a cupcake, they were told one of two things. Some customers were told that a cupcake and two cookies sold for 75 cents. Other customers, however, were not told about the cookies right away&#x2014;a few seconds after they&#x2019;d been told that the cupcakes sold for 75 cents each, it was explained that the price included the cost of two cookies. Results of the study showed that the &#x201C;that&#x2019;s-not-all&#x201D; tactic sold more cupcakes. Specifically, although only 40 percent of the customers who had been presented cookies and cupcakes at the same time made a purchase, 73 percent of the &#x201C;that&#x2019;s-not-all&#x201D; customers made a purchase.</p>
<p>Why does this tactic work so well? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_6">Burger (1986)</xref>, the &#x201C;that&#x2019;s-not-all&#x201D; tactic&#x2019;s effectiveness may be because of the norm of reciprocity and contrast effect (discussed earlier in this chapter). First, because the seller has sweetened the deal by adding on items, the customer may feel obligated to buy the product, thereby <italic>reciprocating</italic> the seller&#x2019;s action. Second, in <italic>contrast</italic> to the original deal, the revised deal may seem much better than it would have without the comparison.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_271">271</target>But wait, there&#x2019;s more: Before concluding this discussion, we should note that the &#x201C;that&#x2019;s-not-all&#x201D; tactic can include more than adding on items to make a deal look better; it can also involve lowering the price of an item. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_6">Burger (1986)</xref> found that more people bought cupcakes when the price was dropped from &#x0024;1 to 75 cents than when the price was simply stated as 75 cents. You might have noticed that, in this form, the &#x201C;that&#x2019;s-not-all&#x201D; tactic is a lot like the door in the face approach. The difference is that, when using the door in the face approach, the persuader waits for the initial request to be rejected before following up with a lesser request. Persuaders using the &#x201C;that&#x2019;s-not-all&#x201D; tactic do not wait for the initial request to be rejected before sweetening the deal. Some evidence indicates that of the two techniques, the &#x201C;that&#x2019;s-not-all&#x201D; tactic is the more persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_6">Burger, 1986</xref>). (For a look at how these two tactics and others might be used together, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box11_2">Box 11.2</xref>.) Even so, salespeople or others wishing to use this tactic need to be careful. Some evidence suggests that it might backfire if the salesperson&#x2019;s initial request is too large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_11">Burger, Reed, DeCesare, Rauner, &#x0026; Rozolis, 1999</xref>). It&#x2019;s not difficult to imagine why. For example, if a salesperson asked you to buy a chocolate chip cookie for &#x0024;5 and then lowered the price to 75 cents, you&#x2019;d probably be suspicious that the initial price was purposely inflated and that the salesperson was trying to pull a fast one.

<caption><title>Doors and Feet: An Extension and Combination of Tactics</title></caption>
<p>If given a choice of sequential request techniques to use, which works best? Some research has addressed this question. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_17">Chan and Au (2011)</xref> found that Chinese children completed more academic work when teachers used the door-in-the-face technique (e.g., &#x201C;Complete 100 questions,&#x201D; then &#x201C;Just complete 20 questions.&#x201D;) than when they used the foot-in-the-door technique (e.g., &#x201C;Complete 5 questions,&#x201D; then &#x201C;Complete 20 questions.&#x201D;). However, rather than pitting techniques against one another, perhaps a better approach, when possible, is to use them together. Indeed, research has found that combinations of sequential tactics can be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_44">Goldman &#x0026; Creason, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_45">Goldman, Creason, &#x0026; McCall, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_46">Goldman, Gier, &#x0026; Smith, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_80">Souchet &#x0026; Girandola, 2013</xref>). For example, two doors in the face or two feet in the door made people more compliant than a single door or foot. Further research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_43">Goldman (1986)</xref> found that the door-in-the-face and foot-in-the-door techniques also can be combined. Here&#x2019;s how it works: First, people are presented with a very large request that they are almost sure to reject (e.g., &#x201C;Would you call 150 people and ask them questions about the zoo?&#x201D;). Second, people are presented with a moderate request that serves as a foot in the door. Because this request follows the very large request, however, it can be more difficult than the initial request that is typically used in the foot-in-the-door approach (e.g., &#x201C;Would you participate in a 25-minute survey about the zoo?&#x201D; versus &#x201C;Would you answer three or four questions about the zoo?&#x201D;). Finally, people are asked to comply with the request that the persuaders wanted them to comply with all along (e.g., &#x201C;Would you stuff and address 75 envelopes with information about the zoo?&#x201D;). Results of Goldman&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_43">1986</xref>) study found that this combination approach was more persuasive than either tactic alone.</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;ve ever bought a car from a dealership, there&#x2019;s a chance you&#x2019;ve seen the <italic>low-ball tactic</italic> in action. Here&#x2019;s how it works. First, the salesperson makes you a deal that looks too good to refuse. Perhaps the car you want is offered for several hundred dollars less than any place else you&#x2019;ve shopped. Excited, you accept the offer. But then, a number of things might go wrong. For instance, the salesperson might inform you that the quoted price did not include an expensive option (e.g., air conditioning) that you thought was included. Or, the salesperson might check with his or her manager for approval and later report that the deal was rejected. Why? The dealership would lose money if the car were sold so cheap. In short, the original offer is taken back, and you are asked to pay a much higher price for the car.</p>
<p>Slimy? You bet. But also very effective. Indeed, two meta-analyses of multiple experiments found that the low-ball tactic increased compliance significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_8">Burger &#x0026; Caputo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_70">Pascual, Carpenter, Gu&#x00E9;guen, &#x0026; Girandola, 2016</xref>). By way of example, in one study, Cialdini and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_20">Cialdini, Cacioppo, Bassett, &#x0026; Miller, 1978</xref>) wanted to see if they could get undergraduate students to wake up <target target-type="page" id="page_273">273</target>early. Here&#x2019;s what happened: Some students were simply asked to participate in a &#x201C;thinking&#x201D; experiment at seven in the morning. Others, however, were asked to participate but were not told when the experiment would take place. If they agreed to participate, they were told the time of the experiment and asked if they were still willing to participate. In other words, the second group of students was lowballed. Results of the study showed that although only 31 percent of the non-lowballed students agreed to participate, 56 percent of the lowballed students agreed.</p>

<caption><title>Cheapening Your Product by Sweetening the Deal: The Drawbacks of Including Free Gifts With Purchases</title></caption>
<p>Not long ago, one of the authors, intending to buy a Valentine&#x2019;s Day gift for his wife, ended up at a cosmetics counter in a local department store. After sniffing at a dozen samples he&#x2019;d dabbed on his arms, he settled on some perfumed lotions. It wasn&#x2019;t until he&#x2019;d paid and was leaving the counter that the salesperson called after him, explaining she&#x2019;d forgotten that those particular lotions came with a free gift&#x2014;a little handbag with an orange ribbon. The author didn&#x2019;t think much of the handbag&#x2014;after all, it was just a freebie, probably something that was out of style or didn&#x2019;t sell&#x2014;but he didn&#x2019;t mention that when he presented it, alongside the lotions, as a gift to his wife. To his surprise, she was thrilled. In fact, she made a bigger fuss over that bag than those darned expensive lotions. At the time, the author chalked up the differences between his and his wife&#x2019;s perceptions to his lack of appreciation for handbags. But then he came across a study suggesting that he was not alone; apparently, other people react the same way to free gifts. Indeed, in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_72">Raghubir, 2004</xref>), research participants were asked to evaluate the desirability of a pearl bracelet. Half were told that the bracelet was a free gift accompanying the purchase of another item, while the other half were presented the bracelet as a stand-alone product. Results showed that the second group was willing to pay more for the bracelet than the first group. Similarly, another study showed that, compared to bundling items and selling them together, marketing them in &#x201C;buy-one, get-one-free&#x201D; offers led to a value-discounting effect&#x2014;the free, add-on item was perceived as less valuable than when it was bundled with something else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_73">Raghubir, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This research, of course, has implications for businesses that include their regular merchandise or services as free promotional items from time to time. By doing so, such businesses may cause their customers to perceive those items or services as less desirable. With that in mind, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_72">Raghubir (2004)</xref> suggests that customers should be informed of how valuable the gift is. For example, rather than say that a handbag is a &#x201C;free gift,&#x201D; a salesperson should say something like, &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll also receive this &#x0024;50 handbag, with our compliments.&#x201D;</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>As unethical as the low-ball tactic seems, it is used far more often than might be expected. Credit card issuers, for instance, are known for tempting customers with low introductory &#x201C;teaser&#x201D; rates. The problem is that these rates may double or even triple in a few months. Rates on some adjustable mortgages do this too; a few years at a very reasonable rate, then&#x2014;BAM!&#x2014;a balloon payment is due.</p>
<sec id="sec11_5_1">
<title>Why Lowballing Works</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_8">Burger and Caputo (2015)</xref>, the effectiveness of the low-ball tactic can be explained by three psychological processes, which include commitment to the action, commitment to the person, and self-presentation. To illustrate the first, let&#x2019;s use the automobile customer as an example. Specifically, when the customer agrees to the initial offer, he or she becomes psychologically committed to the idea of owning the car. Thus, even when the reasons for buying the car change, the customer has a hard time altering his or her decision and commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_20">Cialdini et al., 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_10">Burger and Petty (1981)</xref> suggested that people fall victim to the tactic because agreeing with the initial request creates a commitment to the requester. In other words, people agree to a second, more costly request because they feel obligated to make good on their promises. In support of this hypothesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_10">Burger and Petty (1981)</xref> found that the low-ball tactic works only when the same person who made the first request also makes the less attractive request. It does not work when a different person makes the less attractive request.</p>
<p>The third explanation, self-presentation, suggests that people want to be seen in a favorable light. As such, they comply with requests to avoid looking bad (e.g., like &#x201C;welshers&#x201D; who don&#x2019;t keep their commitments). If that&#x2019;s the case, Gu&#x00E9;guen and Pascual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_52">2014</xref>) wondered how people might respond if asked to comply with requests that were associated with illegal behavior&#x2014;the idea being that people should be less motivated to look good in the eyes of &#x201C;deviant&#x201D; persuaders. To find out, cigarette-smoking pedestrians were approached in one of two ways. In the low-ball condition, a researcher said, &#x201C;I see that you are smoking a cigarette and I wonder if you could give me a light for my cigarette.&#x201D; If the pedestrians agreed, the researcher lowballed them by pulling out a large cannabis joint, which was illegal to smoke in the study&#x2019;s location. In another condition, a researcher produced the cannabis joint before asking for a light. What were the results? Lowballed pedestrians complied more than pedestrians who were not lowballed, leading Gu&#x00E9;guen and Pascual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_52">2014</xref>) to conclude that, compared to commitment, self-presentation is a weaker explanation for the effectiveness of the low-ball tactic.</p>

<p>The next time you see a big sale advertised, be careful. If you aren&#x2019;t, you may fall victim to a persuasion tactic that some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_60">Joule, Gouilloux, &#x0026; Weber, 1989</xref>; Marchand, Joule, &#x0026; Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_64">2015</xref>) call &#x201C;the lure.&#x201D;</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>This tactic &#x2026; is frequently used when goods are put on sale. For example, a beautiful pair of shoes marked 40&#x0025; off is displayed quite conspicuously in a store window. The enticed consumer enters the store with the intention of taking advantage of this exceptional offer, but the salesperson informs him that they are out of the shoe in his size. Just when the disappointed customer is ready to leave the store, he is shown a new pair that resembles the shoes on sale but that is being sold at the regular price.</p>
<attrib>(p. 742)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<p>The travel industry uses the same ploy, which is more commonly known as the <italic>bait-and-switch tactic.</italic> For instance, a company might advertise an inexpensive vacation package as part of a promotion. However, as many prospective travelers discover, very few of these seats or packages are available, and they are often sold out by the time people have committed themselves to the idea of a vacation. The only solution is to go home and mope or buy a more expensive option.</p>
<p>Research by Joule and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_60">1989</xref>) indicates that the bait and switch is an effective strategy for gaining compliance. In one study, these researchers got several students to sign up to participate in a rather interesting and well-paying experiment. When the students showed up for the experiment, however, they were told that it had been canceled. Even so, these students, compared to those who were not lured, were more willing to participate in another experiment that was less interesting and unpaid.</p>
<p>The low-ball and bait-and-switch tactics are similar in that both lead the customer on before pulling the rug out. How do the two differ? With the low-ball technique, the customer is still buying the product he or she wanted, but at a higher cost. There are &#x201C;strings attached&#x201D; to the deal or &#x201C;fine print&#x201D; that drives up the cost. With the baitand-switch, the customer is buying a different product altogether, often at a higher price or of lower quality. The product she or he wanted is sold out or out of stock.</p>

<title>The Disrupt-Then-Reframe and Pique Techniques: I&#x2019;m so Confused</title>
<p>If we offered to sell you five Nutrageous candy bars for 400 pennies, would you buy them? It would be a bargain.</p>
<p>Before you decide to buy anything after being presented an offer like this, be careful. You might be falling for a sequential compliance tactic known as the <italic>disrupt-then-reframe technique</italic> (DTR). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_27">Davis and Knowles (1999)</xref>, the DTR rests on the assumption that certain requests (e.g., asking for charitable donations) create a conflict within persuadees. Specifically, persuadees want to help but are also resistant to the expense or effort required to do so. The DTR overcomes this problem by disrupting the persuadees&#x2019; resistance. How? According to Davis and Knowles, <target target-type="page" id="page_275">275</target>certain confusion techniques (e.g., non sequiturs, requests stated in a peculiar way) can be used to divert people&#x2019;s minds from maintaining resistance. Once that is accomplished, reframing the request with a positive spin (e.g., &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a bargain&#x201D;) works to engage the persuadees&#x2019; underlying desire to help.</p>
<p>To test the effectiveness of this technique, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_27">Davis and Knowles (1999)</xref> examined door-to-door salespeople who were trying to sell greeting cards in order to earn money for a worthy charity. The salespeople presented different messages to potential buyers. Some customers received a straightforward sales pitch&#x2014;&#x201C;The cards are &#x0024;3. It&#x2019;s a bargain&#x201D;&#x2014;whereas others were presented with a slightly peculiar pitch (i.e., the DTR technique)&#x2014;&#x201C;The cards are 300 pennies &#x2026; that&#x2019;s &#x0024;3. It&#x2019;s a bargain.&#x201D; Results of the study indicated that when salespersons used the DTR technique, they sold significantly more cards than when they used the more straightforward approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_27">Davis &#x0026; Knowles, 1999</xref>). A meta-analysis of several studies suggests that this technique is effective, particularly when seeking donations in nonprofit contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_15">Carpenter &#x0026; Boster, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A related approach, called the <italic>pique technique</italic> is simpler (and sounds more poetic) than the DTR. It also involves making a peculiar request. For example, in the first examination of the technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_76">Santos, Leve, &#x0026; Pratkanis, 1994</xref>), a woman posing as a vagrant asked passersby for &#x201C;a quarter,&#x201D; &#x201C;any change,&#x201D; or, more oddly, for &#x201C;17 cents&#x201D; or &#x201C;37 cents.&#x201D; Results indicated that the more unusual requests (i.e., 17 and 37 cents) were more persuasive, perhaps because they, like the DTR, disrupt people&#x2019;s refusal scripts. A recent meta-analysis indicates that the pique technique is especially persuasive when smaller amounts of money are requested, when accompanied by a legitimate reason for making the request, and when used in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_61">Lee &#x0026; Feeley, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Legitimizing Paltry Contributions: Even A Penny Will Help</title>
<p>A technique known as <italic>legitimizing paltry contributions</italic> (LPC for short) involves letting people know that very small donations would be acceptable. By way of example, in the first examination of the LPC technique, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_24">Cialdini and Schroeder (1976)</xref> found that adding the phrase &#x201C;even a penny will help&#x201D; to a request for donations increased the percentage of donations that people made to the American Cancer Society. Similarly, the phrase &#x201C;even a single marble will make him/her happy&#x201D; led more people to donate toys to children from needy families (Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_54">Martin, &#x0026; Meineri, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Originally, the approach was considered an effective way to fend off excuses like &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t afford that right now&#x201D; or &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t have the money for that.&#x201D; A recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_3">Bolkan &#x0026; Rains, 2015</xref>), however, suggests that the LPC is effective for two alternative reasons. Specifically, the impression management (self-presentation) explanation suggests that people who refuse tiny requests might worry that they&#x2019;ll be perceived as heartless cheapskates. Meanwhile, the &#x201C;requester need&#x201D; explanation suggests that people are more willing to donate because they feel that someone willing to accept exceptionally tiny donations must be especially desperate for help.</p>
<p>Previous research suggests that LPC is an effective way of amassing a large number of donations and may be even more effective when combined with other influence techniques (e.g., social proof) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_75">Russell &#x0026; Boster, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_79">Shearman &#x0026; Yoo, 2007</xref>). <target target-type="page" id="page_276">276</target>That said, although LPC garners a larger number of donations, research is inconsistent on whether the technique lowers the amount of money donated per person (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_3">Bolkan &#x0026; Rains, 2015</xref> versus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_62">Lee, Moon, &#x0026; Feeley, 2016</xref>). Either way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_3">Bolkan and Rains (2015)</xref> noted that the technique would still be effective when all-or-none behavior is requested. For instance, someone requesting a signed petition might say, &#x201C;even one signature will help&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_3">Bolkan &#x0026; Rains, 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>The Evoking Freedom Technique: &#x201C;&#x2026; But You Are Free to Accept or Refuse&#x201D;</title>
<p>If you hate being pressured to comply, the <italic>evoking freedom technique</italic> (a.k.a. <italic>but you are free technique)</italic> might appeal to you. If you&#x2019;ve ever heard someone say something like &#x201C;Feel free to say no&#x201D; or &#x201C;I&#x2019;m asking, not insisting,&#x201D; he or she might have been using this technique. In the first study to examine it (Gu&#x00E9;guen &#x0026; Pascual, 2000), pedestrians were approached by an experimenter and asked, &#x201C;Excuse me &#x2026; can I ask for some change to take the bus, please?&#x201D; Only 10 percent of pedestrians complied. However, when the experimenter added the phrase &#x201C;but you are free to accept or to refuse,&#x201D; not only did compliance rates jump to 47.5 percent, the average donation was twice as large. Since then, a growing body of research indicates that the technique is effective in a large number of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_13">Carpenter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_56">Gu&#x00E9;guen, Joule, Halimi-Falkowicz, Pascual, Fischer-Lokou, &#x0026; Dufourcq-Brana, 2013</xref>). One common explanation for the technique&#x2019;s effectiveness is that it reduces psychological reactance. Specifically, because people react negatively when their freedom is restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_5">Brehm, 1966</xref>), declaring them &#x201C;free&#x201D; leads them to experience less reactance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_16">Carpenter &#x0026; Pascual, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_65">Meineri, Dupre, Gu&#x00E9;guen, &#x0026; Vallee, 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Fear-Then-Relief and Happiness-Then-Disappointment Procedures: The Emotional Roller Coasters of Social Influence</title>
<p>If you are a fan of detective novels and movies, you&#x2019;re undoubtedly familiar with the way the &#x201C;good cop/bad cop&#x201D; interrogation operates. First, the &#x201C;bad cop&#x201D; mistreats the suspect, humiliating, yelling at, and threatening to do harm. Next, the &#x201C;good cop&#x201D; enters the interrogation room, asks the bad cop to chill out, and then woos the suspect into confessing with little more than a cup of coffee and a dose of respect. Based on this scenario, Dolinski and Nawrat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_31">Dolinski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_33">Dolinski &#x0026; Nawrat, 1998</xref>) identified the <italic>fear-then-relief procedure</italic>. The assumption underlying the procedure is that fear/relief confuses people, which, in turn, leads them to act rather mindlessly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_32">Dolinski, 2016</xref>). Additionally, complying with requests can help them cope with their confusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_35">Dolinski, Dolinska, &#x0026; Bar-Tal 2017</xref>). As such, they become prone to influence attempts. Previous research indicates that the procedure is effective (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_31">Dolinski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_34">Dolinski &#x0026; Szczucka, 2012</xref>). For example, studies that have scared people (e.g., by blowing police whistles at jaywalkers or leaving &#x201C;tickets&#x201D; on illegally parked vehicles) and then relieved them (by having the people see that police weren&#x2019;t the ones blowing the whistles or that the tickets were really just leaflets), have found that those people are typically more compliant (e.g., willing to complete surveys) than people who have not undergone the procedure. Research also suggests that the <target target-type="page" id="page_277">277</target>persuasive effect of see-sawing emotions is not just confined to fear-then-relief. Indeed, one study found that a <italic>happiness-then-disappointment procedure</italic> (e.g., finding a note that had originally looked like money) also led people to comply more with later requests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_66">Nawrat &#x0026; Dolinski, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Before concluding this section, we think it&#x2019;s important to reiterate that a number of ethical concerns surround the use of influence tactics, perhaps even more so when persuasion involves unpleasant emotions such as fear. Remember, just because a tactic is effective does not mean it is ethical. Given the importance of these topics, we will have more to say about emotions and ethics in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter13">Chapters 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter16">16</xref>.</p>

<title>Summary (And then Some)</title>
<p>This chapter featured some of the most prominently researched sequential tactics. Pregiving involves making a persuadee feel indebted so that he or she will be more compliant. The foot-in-the-door tactic involves making a small request and following up with a large one. The foot-in-the-mouth tactic works by getting people to admit to feeling terrific and then trying to get them to behave in a way consistent with their declaration. The door-in-the-face tactic involves making a large request and following up with a smaller one. The that&#x2019;s-not-all tactic seeks compliance by making deals more attractive before persuadees agree to them. When using the low-ball tactic, persuadees are asked to agree with an attractive request but are expected to agree with a less attractive request later. Similarly, the bait-and-switch technique lures people with merchandise that is attractive in order to get them to buy substitute merchandise that is less attractive. The disrupt-then-reframe and pique tactics divert people from resisting requests. The legitimization-of-paltry-favors approach minimizes excuses for making a donation. The fear-then-relief procedure uses changes in emotion to disorient and then persuade people. The dump-then-chase technique occurs when persuaders persist in their influence attempts by addressing obstacles to compliance.</p>
<p>We realize that we&#x2019;ve covered a heap of strategies this chapter. Even so, we can&#x2019;t help but wish there was more space. Indeed, plenty of additional tactics are waiting to be explored. In case you&#x2019;re interested, <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box11_4">Box 11.4</xref> provides the briefest of glimpses to get you started.</p>

<caption><title>But Wait, There&#x2019;s More: A Laundry List of Additional Tactics</title></caption>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The Foot-in-the-Mouth Effect: Donation seekers are especially successful if they ask people how they are feeling, acknowledge the response, and then request compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_59">Howard, 1990</xref>; Meineri &#x0026; Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_63">2011</xref>). Thus, when a phone solicitor asks, &#x201C;How are you?,&#x201D; you might be putting your foot in your mouth by replying, &#x201C;Great!&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Dump-and-Chase: Persuaders who &#x201C;won&#x2019;t take no for an answer&#x201D; and continue to chase compliance by responding to obstacles are using this tactic. &#x201C;Too expensive?&#x201D; they might reply. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s talk about our layaway plan &#x2026;&#x201D; According to some research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_4">Boster, Shaw, Hughes, Kotowski, Strom, &#x0026; Deatrick, 2009</xref>), <target target-type="page" id="page_278">278</target>the dump-and-chase works just as well as and sometimes better than the foot-in-the-door and door-in-the-face techniques.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Four Walls Technique: Persuaders are more successful when you answer &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to a list of seemingly innocent questions (e.g., &#x201C;Do you like animals?&#x201D; &#x201C;Should animals be well cared for?&#x201D;) before they deliver the target request (e.g., &#x201C;Will you donate to the Humane Society?&#x201D;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_23">Cialdini &#x0026; Sagarin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_55">Gu&#x00E9;guen, Joule, Halimi-Falkowicz, &#x0026; Marchand, 2013</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The &#x201C;Just One More&#x201D; Technique: People are more compliant when they believe that they are the last person required to reach a goal. So, if you want a survey filled out, you should be more successful if you follow &#x201C;Would you be willing to take a survey?&#x201D; with &#x201C;I just need one more person to take my survey&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_14">Carpenter, 2014</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The &#x201C;You Will Probably Refuse, But &#x2026;&#x201D; Technique: Perhaps because it is perceived to threaten their freedom to act, people donate more money to charity when the words &#x201C;You will probably refuse, but &#x2026;&#x201D; come before a request (Gu&#x00E9;guen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11_51">2016</xref>).</p></list-item>

<p>WHEN ONE OF YOUR AUTHORS was 5 or 6 years old, he cut the hair off several of his sister&#x2019;s Barbie dolls. He was a proud little vandal, and savvy enough to realize that an interrogation was inevitable. To prep, he practiced angelic expressions in front of a mirror and then moseyed innocently around the house until his mother, provoked by her daughter&#x2019;s shrieks, found him. &#x201C;Look me in the eye and tell me you didn&#x2019;t do it,&#x201D; his mom said, holding your author gently by his shoulders. &#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t me,&#x201D; the author replied. He stared straight at her &#x2026; and then burst into tears.</p>
<p>Deception, he learned the hard way, is no cakewalk. Likewise, detecting lies, more often than not, is more difficult than this story makes it seem. Indeed, humans, in general, tend to be far less accurate than they believe when trying to detect deception. Some research shows that the average person can detect a liar with about the same accuracy as someone flipping a coin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_8">Bond &#x0026; DePaulo, 2006</xref>), whereas other research presents an even less optimistic view. For example, when accuracy rates for truthful and deceptive messages are examined separately (rather than together, as in most studies), people&#x2019;s detection accuracy is above 50 percent for truths, but well below 50 percent for lies. Levine and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_72">Levine, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_68">Levine &#x0026; Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_73">Levine, Park, &#x0026; McCornack, 1999</xref>) call this the <italic>veracity effect</italic>.</p>
<p>The fact that people are not very accurate at detecting deception is unfortunate when you consider the practical and professional contexts within which accurate detection would be desirable (e.g., for jurists, consumers, law officers, negotiators, customs inspectors, job interviewers, secret service agents, and so forth; see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box12_1">Box 12.1</xref>). Clearly, there are practical advantages to improving detecting abilities, and this <target target-type="page" id="page_284">284</target>observation leads us to the following questions: Are there any reliable cues that can be used to detect deception? If so, what are they? Are some people better at lying than others? Can some people detect deceit more accurately than others? Are there factors that can improve people&#x2019;s ability to detect a liar?</p>

<caption><title>Something Phishy Is Going On: Beware of Internet Deception</title></caption>
<p>Some time ago, one of the authors received an email greeting him as &#x201C;Dear Bank of the West Customer.&#x201D; The email told him that because of too many failed login attempts, his banking account had been locked and could be unlocked only by following a link to a website where he could provide his ATM card number and PIN. Fortunately, he didn&#x2019;t take the bait, unlike others who have been hooked&#x2014;line and sinker&#x2014;by what are known as &#x201C;phishing&#x201D; or &#x201C;spoofing&#x201D; scams. Such scams try to lure you to a website where you provide personal or financial information, which, in turn, enables the con artists to commit identity theft or credit card fraud. Some, known as spear-phishing attacks, target specific victims and people with high net worth, often with intimate knowledge about the victim. In one study, spear phishing fooled one-third of the targets into clicking on an embedded link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_79">Luo, Zhang, Burd, Seazzu, 2013</xref>). To prevent yourself from being filleted by such scams, beware of unfamiliar websites. Use only website addresses you have used before. If you receive an email that seems to be snooping for personal info, be especially wary. If you are suspicious, contact the legitimate company directly. Finally, if you&#x2019;ve been hooked, contact the police and file a complaint with the FBI&#x2019;s Internet Crime Complaint Center (<uri>www.ic3.gov/default.aspx</uri>).</p>

<p>These are some of the questions we address in this chapter. But, before doing so, we would like to make a point. You might ask, &#x201C;Why is a chapter on deception in a book on persuasion?&#x201D; We respond that <italic>deception is a form of persuasion.</italic> Even from the standpoint of pure cases of persuasion, deception involves an intentional attempt to get someone to believe what the liar knows to be false. As Miller (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_89">Miller &#x0026; Stiff, 1993</xref>) argued: &#x201C;Deceptive communication strives for persuasive ends; or, stated more precisely, deceptive communication is a general persuasive strategy that aims at influencing the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of others by means of deliberate message distortion&#x201D; (p. 28).</p>
<p>With this basic understanding of deception as persuasion under our belt, we now turn to a more in-depth discussion of some common conceptualizations of deception. The rest of the chapter examines research on the enactment and perception of deception.</p>
<sec id="sec12_1">
<title>What is Deception? Lies and Damn Lies</title>
<p>In this section, we examine what deception entails conceptually. To answer the &#x201C;conceptual question,&#x201D; scholars have attempted to outline several types of <target target-type="page" id="page_286">286</target>communication that might be considered deceptive. Many attempts to do so have focused on liars&#x2019; motivations for telling lies.</p>
<p>Although some motivations for lying are self-evident, others are less obvious. For example, various researchers have posited all of the following reasons for lying (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_5">Barnett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_26">Camden, Motley, &#x0026; Wilson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_33">DePaulo, Ansfield, Kirkendol, &#x0026; Boden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_75">Lindskold &#x0026; Walters, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_102">Seiter, Bruschke, &#x0026; Bai, 2002</xref>).</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Lie to benefit other:</italic> Because she knows that her husband does not want to be disturbed, Babbs tells a door-to-door salesman that her husband is not home.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lie to affiliate:</italic> Buffy wants to spend some time with her father, so she tells him she needs help with her homework even though she is capable of doing it herself.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lie to avoid invasion of privacy:</italic> Muffy tells a co-worker that she is younger than she really is because she believes her age is no one&#x2019;s business but her own.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lie to avoid conflict:</italic> Biff tells his neighbor, who has called to complain about Biff&#x2019;s barking dog, that he cannot talk at the moment because dinner&#x2019;s on the table.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lie to appear better:</italic> To impress a date, Rex tells her that he was captain of his debate team when, in reality, he was treasurer of the Slide Rule Club (for more on this motivation, see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box12_2">Box 12.2</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lie to protect self:</italic> Trudy breaks her mother&#x2019;s vase but tells her the cat did it.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lie to benefit self:</italic> Favio tells his parents he needs extra money for textbooks so that he can buy tickets to a Lady Gaga concert.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lie to harm other:</italic> Barney&#x2019;s in a bad mood so he points in the wrong direction when a motorist asks him directions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to looking at people&#x2019;s motivations for lying, another approach to conceptualizing deception is to examine the types of strategies people use when lying. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_24">Burgoon, Buller, Ebesu, and Rockwell (1994)</xref> distinguished three deception strategies: <italic>distortion</italic> (or equivocation), <italic>omissions</italic> (or concealment), and <italic>falsification</italic> (outright falsehoods). Yet other researchers have come up with other categories of deception (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_57">Hopper &#x0026; Bell, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to looking at different types of deception, a final way of conceptualizing deception was proposed in <italic>information manipulation theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_82">McCornack, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_87">McCornack, Morrison, Paik, Wisner, &#x0026; Zhu, 2014</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> This theory argues that when we are talking with others, we typically assume that they will be cooperative, providing us information that is not only truthful but also informative, relevant, and clear. We&#x2019;re not always right, however. Indeed, people violate our assumptions by manipulating the information they communicate to us. First, they might not provide the <italic>quantity</italic> of information that we assume they will (i.e., they tell the truth, but not the <italic>whole</italic> truth). Second, they might violate our assumptions about the <italic>quality</italic> of information provided (i.e., what they tell us is not at all true). Third, they might manipulate information through <italic>manner violations</italic>, communicating messages that are vague and ambiguous. Finally, people can engage in <italic>relation violations</italic> by presenting messages that are not relevant. According to the theory, some violations (e.g., quantity) are predicted to occur more frequently than others (e.g., relation). That said, people can alter the quantity, quality, relation, and manner of messages all at the same time or in different <target target-type="page" id="page_287">287</target>combinations. In other words, there is an infinite variety in forms of deception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_86">McCornack, Levine, Solowczuk, Torres, &#x0026; Campbell, 1992</xref>). To give you an idea, examples of the ways in which people manipulate information along each of these dimensions are presented in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box12_3">Box 12.3</xref>.</p>

<caption><title>Can I Believe Anything That Comes Out of Your Mouse? Deception and Online Dating</title></caption>
<p>If you or anyone you know has searched for love on any of the dozens of online dating sites available, beware. Apparently, people&#x2019;s motivation to create desirable impressions when trying to attract prospective partners is so powerful that they&#x2019;ll resort to some serious truth stretching in the process. In one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_108">Toma &#x0026; Hancock, 2010</xref>), for example, researchers invited 80 online daters to their lab. Among other things, the researchers weighed and measured the daters to see if any funny business was going on, and found out that it was. Specifically, 81 percent of the daters lied in their profiles about their height, age, or weight, with men lying more than women about their height and women lying more than men about their weight. Moreover, independent judges considered about one third of the daters&#x2019; online photographs to be deceptive representations of the daters&#x2019; current appearance. In short, if you think &#x201C;seeing is believing,&#x201D; think again.</p>

<p>Gabriella has been babysitting several children for her neighbor, Betty Jones. The youngest child, Morgan (age 2), although usually well behaved, has been a handful all night. To top off a difficult evening, while Gabriella was cooking dinner and helping the other children, Morgan crawled behind the family&#x2019;s new leather couch and scribbled all over the back of it with a permanent marker. Although Gabriella scrubbed the couch with soap and water, she couldn&#x2019;t get the stains out. Later, after Gabriella has put the children to bed, Betty Jones returned home and inquired, &#x201C;How did the night go?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Examples of responses that:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Are clear, direct, and truthful: &#x201C;Tonight was not good, Mrs. Jones. Morgan acted up most of the night. I don&#x2019;t know what got into him. As I was making dinner and helping the girls with their homework, he wrote all over the back of the couch with a Sharpie. I tried to get it off, but it was no use. I&#x2019;m sorry if I didn&#x2019;t watch him as closely as I should have.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Violate assumptions about the quantity of information that should be provided: &#x201C;Morgan was a little naughty, but it was no big deal.&#x201D;</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Violate assumptions about the relevance of information that should be provided: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t mean to be rude, but I really need to be getting home, Mrs. Jones. It&#x2019;s late and I have homework to do.&#x201D;</p></list-item>

<p>Having laid the groundwork for examining deception, we now discuss what happens during the process of deception&#x2014;that is, what goes on while deception is being enacted, and how is deception detected?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12_2">
<title>Telling Lies: The Enactment of Deception</title>
<p>If all liars had noses like Pinocchio, deception detection would not be a problem. Unfortunately, spotting lies is not that simple. In fact, even empirical research has been inconsistent when trying to identify the types of behaviors that we can expect out of liars. (Some of the behaviors that have been associated with deception are listed in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box12_4">Box 12.4</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec12_2_1">
<title>Theoretical Frameworks</title>
<p>Despite these inconsistencies, however, several theories of deception have been proposed that attempt to provide an understanding of the types of behaviors that are typical of liars. One such framework, known as the <italic>four-factor model,</italic> was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_116">Zuckerman and Driver (1985)</xref>. Another, known as <italic>interpersonal deception theory,</italic> was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_16">Burgoon and Buller (2004)</xref>. The following sections discuss each of these perspectives.</p>
<sec id="sec12_2_1_1">
<title>The Four-Factor Model</title>
<p>Rather than simply list all the things that people do when telling lies, the four-factor model tries to explain the underlying processes governing deceptive behavior. In other <target target-type="page" id="page_288">288</target>words, rather than tell us <italic>what</italic> people do when lying, the model tries to tell us <italic>why</italic> people behave differently when lying. According to the model, the four factors that influence behavior when lying are arousal, attempted control, felt emotions, and cognitive effort.</p>

<caption><title>How Do Liars Behave?</title></caption>
<p>A meta-analysis is a summary of several studies. Such an analysis attempts to resolve inconsistencies in research. Several of these analyses (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_31">DePaulo, Stone, &#x0026; Lassiter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_62">Kraut, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_103">Sporer &#x0026; Schwandt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_109">Vrij, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_116">Zuckerman &#x0026; Driver, 1985</xref>) have examined cues that were associated with deception across a number of studies, but the largest analysis, combining the results of 1,338 estimates of 158 deception cues, was conducted by DePaulo and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_34">DePaulo et al., 2003</xref>). Based on this analysis, a number of cues were found to be associated with deception. Keep in mind, though, that all of these cues must be prefaced with the caveat, in general:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Talking time: Liars&#x2019; responses are shorter than truth tellers&#x2019; responses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Details: Liars provide fewer details than do truth tellers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Pressing lips: Liars press their lips (as if holding back) more than truth tellers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Making sense: Compared to truth tellers, liars&#x2019; stories are rated as more discrepant and ambivalent and as having less plausibility and logical structure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Lack of immediacy: Both verbally and vocally, liars seem evasive and impersonal, linguistically distancing themselves from their listeners and from the contents of their presentations (e.g., using passive vs. active voice).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Uncertainty: Liars are rated as sounding more uncertain than truth tellers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Raising chin: Liars raise their chins more than truth tellers, perhaps to try to appear more certain about their stories.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Repetition: Liars repeat themselves more than do truth tellers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Cooperation: Liars are rated as less cooperative in their conversations than are truth tellers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Negative statements: Liars&#x2019; responses contain more negative expressions and complaints than do truth tellers&#x2019; responses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Pleasantness: Liars&#x2019; faces are less pleasant than are truth tellers&#x2019; faces.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Nervousness: Overall, liars appear more nervous than truth tellers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Vocal tension and pitch: Compared to truth tellers, liars&#x2019; voices are more tense, and liars speak in a higher pitch.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Pupil dilation: Liars&#x2019; pupils are more dilated than are truth tellers&#x2019; pupils.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Fidgeting: Liars fidget more than truth tellers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Spontaneous corrections: Truth tellers spontaneously correct themselves more than do liars.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Admitted lack of memory: Truth tellers admit not remembering things more than do liars.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Related external associations: Compared to truth tellers, liars are more likely to mention events or relationships peripheral to the key event they are discussing.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Although the meta-analysis by DePaulo and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_34">2003</xref>) examined some verbal behaviors, it focused primarily on nonverbal behaviors. Given that, some researchers have wondered whether a reliable set of verbal cues to deception might be uncovered. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_2">Ali and Levine (2008)</xref>, however, although verbal indicators of deception appear to exist, they have not been consistent from situation to situation or from study to study.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>First, the model assumes that people are more aroused or anxious when telling lies than when telling the truth. This is also the principle on which the polygraph operates. Of course, we know that results from polygraphs are inadmissible in courts because they are not 100 percent accurate. Why? Because a sociopath, for instance, who feels no remorse for murder certainly won&#x2019;t get anxious when lying. Even so, not all people are sociopaths. We know that many people do feel anxious when they lie. Perhaps they fear getting caught. Perhaps telling the lie reminds them of information they want hidden. Perhaps they are simply motivated to succeed in the deceptive task. Whatever the case, we know that such arousal can lead to certain behaviors during deception. Poker players, for example, are said to wear sunglasses because their pupils dilate when they get a good hand. Similarly, pupil dilation can be a reliable indicator of deception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_34">DePaulo et al., 2003</xref>). What other cues to arousal accompany deception? A few that researchers have investigated include speech errors, speech hesitations, word-phrase repetitions, increased adaptors (e.g., finger fidgeting), eye blinks, vocal pitch, and leg movements.</p>
<p>Second, because people do not want to get caught telling lies, the four-factor model argues that they try to control their behaviors. This seems to be the case both before and during deception. For example, Hartwig, Granhag, and Str&#x00F6;mwall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_52">2007</xref>) found that when planning to be interrogated, liars strategized more than truth tellers by planning to remain calm and pleasant. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_109">Vrij (2000)</xref> reported that during deception, liars tend to limit their movement to keep from looking nervous. Similarly, according to Ekman and Friesen&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_37">1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_38">1974</xref>) <italic>sending capacity hypothesis,</italic> when people tell lies, they try to control their behaviors but, in the process, pay more attention to some cues than others. Because it is difficult to monitor everything they do, liars try to control behaviors that communicate the most information, such as facial expressions and the words they use. But, while busy monitoring their faces and words, they tend to forget about parts of their body that communicate little information such as their legs and feet. So, according to the sending capacity hypothesis, those parts of the body that communicate little information reveal the most when people are lying. In other words, because people are concentrating so much on their faces and words, deception &#x201C;leaks&#x201D; in other places. At least some research tends to support this notion. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_27">Caso, Vrij, Mann, and De Leo (2006)</xref> found that, even when they were taught how to avoid looking deceptive, research participants were more effective at controlling their words than their nonverbal behavior. Moreover, one study found that people who watched liars&#x2019; heads and faces (higher sending capacity) were less accurate at detecting deception than people who watched liars&#x2019; bodies (lower sending capacity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_38">Ekman &#x0026; Friesen, 1974</xref>). Finally, in a summary of more than 30 studies in which judges tried to detect others&#x2019; deception from either single channels (i.e., only the face, body, tone of voice, or words of the liar) or from particular channel combinations, DePaulo and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_31">1985</xref>) found that in all conditions in which judges relied on facial cues, detection accuracy was lower.</p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_290">290</target>In addition to arousal and attempted control, the four-factor model asserts that affective factors influence our behavior when telling lies. And if you stop to think about it, you could probably figure out what types of emotions would be associated with telling a lie. Indeed, in our culture, deception is generally frowned on. Children are taught that &#x201C;the truth shall set them free,&#x201D; &#x201C;honesty is the best policy,&#x201D; &#x201C;what tangled webs are weaved,&#x201D; and often chide one another with rhymes such as &#x201C;liar, liar, pants on fire.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s no surprise, then, that deceptive behavior would be associated with negative emotions such as guilt. It is because of these negative affects that researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_34">DePaulo et al., 2003</xref>) hypothesized that when compared to truthful communicators, deceivers display less facial pleasantness and make more negative remarks. We should note, however, that not all deception is associated with the display of negative emotions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_36">Paul Ekman (1985)</xref>, for instance, argued that liars may experience &#x201C;duping delight,&#x201D; as the result of facing or successfully meeting the challenge of deceiving another person.</p>
<p>Finally, the four-factor model asserts that cognitive factors play a role in the way people behave when lying. Stated differently, lying requires you to think a lot harder than telling the truth does. Why? Because it&#x2019;s fairly easy to tell a story about something you&#x2019;ve already heard or experienced. When you lie, however, you are oftentimes required to &#x201C;make things up as you go along.&#x201D; Not only that, you must be careful not to contradict something you&#x2019;ve said before. (Remember the old saying <target target-type="page" id="page_291">291</target>&#x201C;Liars need a good memory&#x201D;?) Because lying requires extra cognitive effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_110">Vrij, 2014</xref>), it&#x2019;s no wonder that researchers have hypothesized that liars, compared to people telling the truth, would take a longer time to respond, pause more when speaking, and deliver messages with few specifics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_112">Vrij, Granhag, Mann, &#x0026; Leal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_116">Zuckerman &#x0026; Driver, 1985</xref>).</p>

<title>Interpersonal Deception Theory</title>
<p><italic>Interpersonal deception theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_16">Burgoon &#x0026; Buller, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_21">2008</xref>) views deception as an interactional phenomenon in which both senders and receivers simultaneously encode and decode messages over time. In the process, both the liar&#x2019;s and the detector&#x2019;s goals, expectations, and knowledge affect their thoughts and behaviors. In turn, such thoughts and behaviors affect how accurately lies are detected and whether liars suspect that they are doubted. Later in this chapter, we examine other assumptions that detail the theory. At this point, however, the aspect of interpersonal deception theory that is most relevant is its distinction between <italic>strategic</italic> and <italic>nonstrategic</italic> behaviors during deception. Specifically, interpersonal deception theory argues that a liar&#x2019;s communication consists of both intentional (strategic) attempts to appear honest and unintentional (nonstrategic) behaviors that are beyond the liar&#x2019;s control.</p>
<p>First, interpersonal deception theory says that, to avoid being detected, liars strategically create messages with certain characteristics. For instance, liars might (1) <italic>manipulate the information in their messages</italic> to dissociate themselves from the message (e.g., liars might refer to themselves very little so they distance themselves from the responsibility of their statements), convey uncertainty or vagueness (because creating messages with a lot of specific details would increase the likelihood of detection), or withhold information (e.g., liars might create brief messages). Liars might also (2) <italic>strategically control their behavior</italic> to suppress deception cues (e.g., liars might withdraw by gazing or nodding less than people telling the truth). Finally, liars might try to strategically (3) <italic>manage their image</italic> by smiling or nodding to make themselves appear more credible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_20">Buller, Burgoon, White, &#x0026; Ebesu, 1994</xref>). Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_115">White and Burgoon (2001)</xref> found that during interactions, deceivers continue to modify and adapt their behaviors, thereby supporting the notion that some deceptive behaviors are strategic.</p>
<p>Second, although liars try to control their behaviors strategically, they also exhibit some <italic>nonstrategic communication.</italic> In other words, some behaviors &#x201C;leak out&#x201D; beyond the liar&#x2019;s awareness or control. As noted previously (see the four-factor model), such communication might result from arousal (e.g., blinks, pupil dilation, vocal nervousness, speech errors, leg and body movements, and shorter responses) or negative emotions (e.g., less nodding, less smiling, more negative statements).</p>

<sec id="sec12_2_1_3">
<title>Criticisms of Theoretical Assumptions</title>
<p>Before concluding this section, we should note that many scholars have expressed skepticism about certain assumptions contained in interpersonal deception theory and the four-factor model (for reviews and criticism, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_42">Feeley &#x0026; Young, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_72">Levine &#x0026; McCornack, 2014</xref>). For example, McCornack and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_83">McCornack, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_87">McCornack et al., 2014</xref>) argued that, in some cases, telling lies may be less cognitively difficult and arousing than telling the truth. Imagine what <target target-type="page" id="page_292">292</target>you&#x2019;d do if a close friend asked you how you liked her new hairstyle. Imagine also that you thought the hairstyle looked hideous. In such situations, rather than creating a truthful yet tactful message that would preserve your relationship and spare your friend&#x2019;s feelings, it might be less cognitively taxing and less stressful to simply tell your friend that you loved her hair. In short, the underlying differences between truths and lies may not be as simple as some models make them out to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_83">McCornack, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>What do we think of such criticisms? Recall from <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter1">Chapter 1</xref> that the complex nature of persuasion provides one of the most compelling reasons for studying it. When research seems confusing or contradictory, oftentimes it&#x2019;s because the research is approaching the study of persuasion too simplistically. With that in mind, we believe that the preceding criticisms should not be ignored by those who study deception. They are important because they suggest that deceptive behaviors are far more complex than many of us originally imagined. However, while such criticisms should be applauded, we do not think that they render assumptions from the four-factor model and interpersonal deception theory useless. Instead, they suggest that these assumptions apply to some but not all deceptive encounters. Telling different types of lies may lead to different types of behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_102">Seiter et al., 2002</xref>). For example, fabricating lies may require more mental effort than telling the truth, but only when lies are narrative or spontaneous in nature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_110">Vrij, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_111">Vrij, Kneller, &#x0026; Mann, 2000</xref>). Moreover, the notion that deception leads to arousal may apply less to fibs and white lies than to more serious forms of deception, such as cheating on a spouse or denying a crime. Even then, what qualifies as a &#x201C;serious&#x201D; form of deception is subject to interpretation. For example, previous research indicates that a person&#x2019;s cultural background not only influences how acceptable that person perceives a lie to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_88">Mealy, Stephan, &#x0026; Urrutia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_102">Seiter et al., 2002</xref>), but also the emotions (e.g., guilt and shame) that person expects to experience after telling a lie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_100">Seiter &#x0026; Bruschke, 2007</xref>). In short, our assumptions about deceptive behavior may need to be more qualified or complex in nature. For instance, in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box12_3">Box 12.3</xref>, we list several cues to deception. It turns out that under certain conditions, the list gets longer. With that in mind, we turn to a discussion of factors affecting successful deception.</p>

<title>What Makes a Liar Persuasive?</title>
<p>Previous research suggests that some people are better at &#x201C;pulling the wool over our eyes&#x201D; than others. For instance, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_9">Bond and DePaulo (2008)</xref> and Levine and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_74">Levine, Serota, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_65">Levine, 2016</xref>) indicates that while some people are especially <italic>transparent</italic>, leaking the fact that they are lying, others have an honest <italic>demeanor</italic> and, consequently, are typically seen as being truthful even when they are lying. In this section, we discuss the ways in which characteristics of the liar&#x2014;in addition to characteristics of the lie being told and the deceptive situation&#x2014;affect the process of deception.</p>
<sec id="sec12_2_2_1">
<title>The &#x201C;Wool Pullers&#x201D;</title>
<p>The boy who cried wolf should have quit while he was ahead. Or, before he got eaten, he should have at least taken a personality test. If he had, our guess is that he would have scored high on a test that measures a trait known as <italic>Machiavellianism.</italic> The Machiavellian personality is not interested in interpersonal relationships, <target target-type="page" id="page_293">293</target>manipulates others for selfish purposes, and has little sense of social morality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_28">Christie &#x0026; Geis, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_46">Geis &#x0026; Moon, 1981</xref>). Machiavellian personalities are truly &#x201C;wolves in sheep&#x2019;s clothing.&#x201D; Not only do they lie and intend to cheat more often than their counterparts (i.e., low Machiavellians) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_15">Brewer, &#x0026; Abell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_58">Jonason, Lyons, Baughman, &#x0026; Vernon, 2014</xref>), they appear more innocent while doing so. Indeed, a classic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_11">Braginsky (1970)</xref> backs up this claim. In the study, high and low Machiavellian children tasted bitter crackers and then were offered a nickel for each cracker they could get their little chums to eat. The results of the study showed that the high Machiavellian children were not only the most successful in their persuasive attempts, but were also seen as more innocent and honest than the low Machiavellian children.</p>
<p>In addition to Machiavellianism, a person&#x2019;s social skills influence how successful he or she is at deceiving others. For example, high self-monitors, people who use situational information to behave more appropriately, tend to be more skilled at deception than low self-monitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_39">Elliot, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_90">Miller, deTurck, &#x0026; Kalbfleisch, 1983</xref>). Moreover, people skilled at communicating basic emotions are particularly good at convincing others to believe their deceptive messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_95">Riggio &#x0026; Friedman, 1983</xref>), whereas those who are apprehensive in their communication tend to leak more deceptive cues (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_92">O&#x2019;Hair, Cody, &#x0026; Behnke, 1985</xref>). Similarly, people who are expressive and socially tactful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_96">Riggio, Tucker, &#x0026; Throckmorton, 1987</xref>); socially skilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_97">Riggio, Tucker, &#x0026; Widaman, 1987</xref>); competent communicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_40">Feeley, 1996</xref>); and attentive, friendly, and precise in their communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_94">O&#x2019;Hair, Cody, Goss, &#x0026; Krayer, 1988</xref>) are more successful at deceiving others than those who do not possess such skills.</p>
<p>Finally, who do you suppose is better at not being detected when lying&#x2014;males or females? The results of two meta-analyses found that males tend to be more successful at lying than females (Kalbfleisch, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_25">Burgoon, Buller, Grandpre, &#x0026; Kalbfleisch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_117">Zuckerman, DePaulo, &#x0026; Rosenthal, 1981</xref>). Even so, a review of literature by Burgoon and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_25">1998</xref>) suggests that such gender differences are small, perhaps because the deceptive strategies of men and women both have shortcomings. Specifically, when they are lying, men tend to restrict their nonverbal behavior. Although this may prevent them from leaking deceptive cues, if they overdo it, they run the risk of appearing deceptive. Women, however, try to appear more involved in conversations. As a result, this greater activation may cause them to leak more arousal cues and appear more nervous than usual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_25">Burgoon et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Are Some Lies Easier to Tell Than Others?</title>
<p>Imagine that Babbs, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, has a curfew of 9 p.m. It&#x2019;s Thursday, a school night, but Babbs is on the dance floor, partying it up when she suddenly notices the time: 11 p.m! Knowing that her parents usually go to bed around 8 p.m., she hopes they&#x2019;ll be asleep but, on arriving home, she finds herself face to face with her parents, who have been waiting up for her. &#x201C;Where have you been?&#x201D; they demand to know, at about the same time Babbs decides that she had better start lying her pants off if she doesn&#x2019;t want to spend the next two weeks in solitary confinement.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_294">294</target>How successful do you think Babbs will be? According to previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_93">O&#x2019;Hair, Cody, &#x0026; McLaughlin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_110">Vrij, 2014</xref>), behavior during deception depends, to a large extent, on whether the liar is telling a prepared lie or a spontaneous lie. To be sure, think about some of the components of the four-factor model we discussed earlier. When telling a prepared lie, compared to a spontaneous lie, Babbs should be less aroused, have more control, and should not find lying as cognitively difficult. Not surprisingly, research on deceptive cues supports this idea; in general, spontaneous lies are accompanied by more cues associated with deception than are prepared lies. And, because prepared liars make a more credible impression, they are more difficult to detect than spontaneous liars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_35">deTurck &#x0026; Miller, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_76">Littlepage &#x0026; Pineault, 1979</xref>; Str&#x00F6;mwall, Granhag, &#x0026; Landstr&#x00F6;m, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_106">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Spontaneity, though, is not the only dimension of a lie that seems to affect deceptive success. Indeed, research also has shown that the length and the content of a lie influences how well a person can tell it. Longer lies, for instance, are more difficult to tell than short ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_61">Kraut, 1978</xref>). And concerning content, in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_107">Thackray and Orne (1968)</xref>, subjects played the role of an espionage agent who attempted to conceal both his or her identity and certain code words he or she had learned. The results of the study showed that subjects were more successful when telling lies about personally relevant information (i.e., their identity) than when telling lies about neutral information (i.e., code numbers). Similarly, one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_114">Warren, Schertler, &#x0026; Bull, 2009</xref>) found that people detected emotional lies (e.g., liars describing Hawaiian landscapes while watching videos of grisly surgeries) more successfully than they detected unemotional lies (liars describing surgeries while watching landscape videos). This finding is consistent with a meta-analysis showing that deceivers displayed fewer nods and illustrators when lying about facts and feelings than when lying about facts only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_103">Sporer &#x0026; Schwandt, 2007</xref>). Finally, a meta-analysis by DePaulo and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_34">2003</xref>) found that when lying about transgressions, people took longer to respond, talked faster, blinked more, and fidgeted less than truth tellers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12_2_2_3">
<title>Deceptive Situations and Deceptive Success</title>
<p>The context in which a lie is told can influence how successful the liar is. Several situational features have been found to influence deception success. One is motivation. Certainly, there are times when you are simply more motivated to lie successfully than others. A fisherman, for example, may not care so much when someone discovers that his trophy &#x201C;bass&#x201D; was really a guppy. A playboy husband cheating on his wife, however, might have more at stake if his affair were discovered. So who, then, is the better liar: the fisherman or the cheat?</p>
<p>To address this question, recall the four-factor model, which suggests that liars attempt to control their behavior to avoid being detected. As you might suspect, this attempt to control behavior increases as people&#x2019;s motivation to lie successfully increases. Consequently, as people become more motivated to lie successfully, their behavior becomes more rigid and over-controlled, a phenomenon known as the <italic>motivational impairment effect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_30">DePaulo &#x0026; Kirkendol, 1989</xref>). In short, being overly motivated may cause you to be especially detectable.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_295">295</target>To further illustrate the role of motivation in the process of deception, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_45">Frank and Ekman (1997)</xref> gave 20 males &#x0024;10 each for participating in their research. As part of the study, the males were provided with an opportunity to commit a &#x201C;mock&#x201D; crime&#x2014; they would either steal or not steal &#x0024;50 from a briefcase. Before given the opportunity, the participants were told that if they took the money and were able to convince an interrogator that they were innocent, they could keep the &#x0024;50. If, however, they were caught lying, they would be punished. Specifically, if caught, they would be forced to forfeit both the stolen &#x0024;50 and their initial &#x0024;10 participation fee. Worse yet, they would be required to sit on a cold, metal chair inside a cramped, darkened room, where they would have to endure anywhere from 10 to 40 randomly sequenced, 110-decibel startling blasts of white noise over the course of an hour. Needless to say, the liars in this study were motivated to succeed. Unfortunately for them, results of the study showed that telling such high-stakes lies made them consistently detectable to certain types of people (if you were worried about how they fared in the &#x201C;torture chamber,&#x201D; rest assured, the researchers didn&#x2019;t follow through on their threat). In short, telling high-stakes lies motivates people to succeed and, as a result, makes them more detectable.</p>

<title>Detecting Deception: I Can See Right Through You</title>
<p>Just as persuaders need someone to persuade, liars need someone to lie to. In the preceding pages we discussed deception from the liar&#x2019;s perspective. In this section, we examine the opposite side of the coin: deception detection. One framework, proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_99">Seiter (1997)</xref>, suggests that we treat deception detection a lot like reaching a verdict in a trial (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_56">Henningsen, Valde, &#x0026; Davies, 2005</xref>). Whichever verdict we reach (i.e., the person is lying or the person is telling the truth) depends on how we integrate a vast array of verbal and nonverbal information (e.g., Biff is twitching), past knowledge (e.g., Biff doesn&#x2019;t like Gummi Bears), and inferences (e.g., Biff is nervous). Sometimes the information we observe is contradictory (e.g., Biff seems nervous but tells a plausible story), and, sometimes new information causes us to discount our earlier perceptions. This illustrates how complex and idiosyncratic the process of deception detection can be. In other words, the information that one person uses to detect deception may be quite different from the information that another uses. With that as a backdrop, we turn now to a discussion of factors that affect the detection process.</p>
<sec id="sec12_3_1">
<title>Factors That Influence Detection</title>
<sec id="sec12_3_1_1">
<title>Truth Bias: Presuming That People are Honest</title>
<p>Suppose what would happen if everyone in the world always suspected that everyone else was lying. Cooperation would become impossible. So instead, people tend to assume that other people are being honest. In other words, we go through life with a &#x201C;<italic>truth bias,&#x201D;</italic> mostly believing what other people tell us. This notion forms the basis of Levine&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_64">2014</xref>) <italic>truth-default theory</italic>. According to the theory, the truth bias is adaptive and functional because most of the time people are being honest. When they&#x2019;re being deceptive, however, the truth bias makes detecting them less likely.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_296">296</target>&#x201C;Look Me in the Eye&#x201D;: Stereotypes and Intuitions About Deception</title>
<p>What kinds of things do you look for to detect deception? When we ask our students this question, the most common response we get is &#x201C;eye contact.&#x201D; When people are lying, our students suggest, they won&#x2019;t look you in the eye or they look up and to the right.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;ve ever thought the same thing about lying and eye contact, you and our students are not alone. According to Lock&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_77">2005</xref>) sources, research in more than 60 countries indicates that, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, people report that eye contact is one of the most common behaviors they use for detecting deception. Here&#x2019;s the catch, though: Generally, research has shown that liars do not avoid eye contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_34">DePaulo, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_103">Sporer &#x0026; Schwandt, 2007</xref>), and in some situations engage in more deliberate eye contact than truth do tellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_81">Mann, Vrij, Shaw, Leal, Ewens, Hillman, Granhag, &#x0026; Fisher, 2013</xref>). Likewise, evidence that people look in certain directions when lying&#x2014;a hypothesis derived from neurolinguistic programming&#x2014;is weak at best (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_80">Mann, Vrij, Nasholm, Warmelink, Leal, &#x0026; Forrester, 2012</xref>). What&#x2019;s more, many of the other behaviors people say they use to detect deception are not reliable indicators of deception (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_49">Granhag, Giolla, Sooniste, Stromwell, &#x0026; Lui-Jonsson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_50">Hart, Hudson, Fillmore, &#x0026; Griffith, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that, you might be thinking that such stereotypes are to blame for our generally less-than-stellar ability to detect deception. If so, think again. Although this notion, known as the <italic>wrong subjective cue hypothesis</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_51">Hartwig &#x0026; Bond, 2011</xref>), prevailed for decades, recent research suggests that people tend to be unaware of the cues they actually rely on to detect deception. In other words, people <italic>say</italic> they look for one set of cues, but they actually use a different set of cues. In one meta-analysis, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_51">Hartwig and Bond (2011)</xref> found that rather than relying on lack of eye contact and other stereotypical cues, people tend to look for signs of ambivalence, uncertainty, and indifference to detect deception. What&#x2019;s more, the latter group of cues was more reliable, suggesting that people&#x2019;s intuitions about deceptive cues are less flawed than the stereotypical cues they report using. As such, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_51">Hartwig and Bond (2011)</xref> note that one possible avenue for improving detection might be to promote (and improve) more automatic, intuitive processing of messages. This, they suggest, might occur if people receive feedback about the accuracy of their judgments often enough to develop useful intuitions about deceptive behaviors.</p>

<sec id="sec12_3_1_3">
<title>Training People to Be Effective Lie Detectors</title>
<p>Training people to be better at spotting lies, however, could prove to be tricky business. Indeed, an analysis of 30 studies indicated that training people to spot verbal and nonverbal cues to deception improved their detection accuracy, but the effect was small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_54">Hauch, Sporer, Michael, &#x0026; Meissner, 2016</xref>). Not only that, two studies found that training might actually backfire (Akehurst, Bull, Vrij, &#x0026; K&#x00F6;hnken, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_1">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_59">Kassin &#x0026; Fong, 1999</xref>)&#x2014;that is, people who had been trained to spot cues to deception, compared to those who had not, were significantly <italic>less</italic> accurate at spotting lies.</p>
<p>That said, if you&#x2019;re thinking that deception detection is a hopeless endeavor, don&#x2019;t surrender just yet. Instead, keep in mind that when experts are allowed to actively question suspects, accuracy rates get much higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_67">Levine, Clare, Blair, McCornack, Morrison, &#x0026; Park, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_78">Luke, Hartwig, Joseph, Brimbal, Chan, Dawson, Jordan, Donovan, &#x0026; Granhag, 2016</xref>). <target target-type="page" id="page_297">297</target>With that in mind, a more promising approach might be to focus on improving people&#x2019;s interrogation techniques, a topic we&#x2019;ll return to later in this chapter.</p>

<title>Humans as Polygraphs</title>
<p>Just as some people are better at deceiving others, are some people more skillful at detecting deception? Some research seems to indicate that this is the case. For example, earlier we mentioned that some, but not all people, were fairly consistent when trying to detect high-stakes lies. What, then, you might wonder, distinguishes these people from more gullible folks? Is there some type of trait or individual difference that separates effective from ineffective deception detectors? If so, research has not identified it. Although some studies have identified individual differences such as involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_44">Forrest &#x0026; Feldman, 2000</xref>), self-monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_13">Brandt, Miller, &#x0026; Hocking, 1980b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_47">Geizer, Rarick, &#x0026; Soldow, 1977</xref>), and sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_32">DePaulo, Zuckerman, &#x0026; Rosenthal, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_98">Rosenthal &#x0026; DePaulo, 1979</xref>) as characteristics that may help or hinder successful deception detection, one meta-analysis examining over 140 studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_9">Bond &#x0026; DePaulo, 2008</xref>) found that when large numbers of studies are examined side by side, individual differences do not appear to play a significant role in deception detection. Such differences do, however, predispose some people to be more suspicious and others to be more trusting, which, in turn, may make them less accurate when trying to distinguish lies from truths. We will examine these biases later in the chapter. For now, though, we should mention that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_9">Bond and DePaulo (2008)</xref> do not completely rule out the possibility that individual differences may affect deception detection in the real world. For example, they suggest that individual differences in people&#x2019;s ability to analyze nonverbal behaviors some time after an interaction might lead to more accuracy.</p>

<title>Familiarity, Biases, and Deception Detection</title>
<p>Does knowing a person help us detect his or her deception? Several researchers have asked this question but, for quite some time, results of such studies seemed mixed. For instance, in five studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_12">Brandt, Miller, &#x0026; Hocking, 1980a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_13">1980b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_14">1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_41">Feeley &#x0026; deTurck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_43">Feeley, deTurck, &#x0026; Young, 1995</xref>), people rated communicators&#x2019; veracity after either watching or not watching videotapes of the communicators&#x2019; normal, truthful behavior. The results of these studies showed that people who were familiar with the communicators&#x2019; previous, truthful behaviors were more accurate in their judgments than those who were unfamiliar. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_29">Comadena (1982)</xref> found that spouses could detect each other&#x2019;s deception better than friends could. However, Miller and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_91">1981</xref>) found that when judging lies about emotional information, friends were more accurate than either strangers or spouses, and two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_3">Al-Simadi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_101">Seiter &#x0026; Wiseman, 1995</xref>) found that people who tried to detect the deception of people from their own ethnic or cultural group (e.g., those with whom they would presumably be the most familiar) were less accurate than people who tried to detect the deception of people from ethnic or cultural groups other than their own.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12_2"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
<p>Although such results may seem inconclusive, interpersonal deception theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_17">Buller, Stiff, &#x0026; Burgoon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_21">Burgoon &#x0026; Buller, 2008</xref>) suggests that they may not be when you consider the possible effects of familiarity on deception. The theory <target target-type="page" id="page_298">298</target>argues that familiarity is a double-edged sword: In some ways, it may help you to be a better deception detector; in other ways, it might hinder your ability to detect deception. First, because of certain biases, the better you know someone, the less effective you are at detecting his or her lies. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_85">McCornack and Parks (1986)</xref> found that familiarity increased a person&#x2019;s confidence about judging veracity which, in turn, led to a <italic>truth bias</italic> (see above). The results of their study and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_104">Stiff, Kim, &#x0026; Ramesh, 1992</xref>) support this idea by showing that the truth bias was positively associated with familiarity and negatively associated with detection accuracy. In other words, people were less accurate when judging familiar others because they thought the others were always honest and trustworthy. In positive relationships based on trust, a truth bias is likely. However, in &#x201C;negative&#x201D; relationships, a <italic>lie bias</italic> (i.e., the perception that people are being dishonest) becomes more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_84">McCornack &#x0026; Levine, 1990</xref>). Whatever the case, both the truth and lie biases make you less accurate when judging veracity because they prevent you from distinguishing truths from lies.</p>
<p>Although truth and lie biases make you less accurate at detecting the deception of familiar others, the knowledge you&#x2019;ve gained about familiar others can also make you more accurate at detecting them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_18">Buller, Stiff, &#x0026; Burgoon, 1996</xref>). Specifically, because you have more background information about familiar others, you might be more likely to notice contradictions in what they say (e.g., your significant other has told you that he or she has never been to San Francisco but later says, &#x201C;The view from the Golden Gate Bridge is fantastic&#x201D;). Moreover, because you have more knowledge about the way a familiar other typically behaves, you may be more likely to detect his or her deception when the behavior suddenly changes (e.g., your significant other, who is normally calm, becomes very nervous whenever he or she talks about espionage agents). Finally, when you know another person well, you may be more likely to recognize idiosyncratic behaviors that that person only enacts while lying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_4">Anderson, Ansfield, &#x0026; DePaulo, 1999</xref>). In short, then, familiarity can both help and hinder accurate deception detection. Familiarity is related to biases that decrease accuracy and knowledge that increases accuracy.</p>

<sec id="sec12_3_1_6">
<title>Suspicion</title>
<p>According to interpersonal deception theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_18">Buller, Stiff, &#x0026; Burgoon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_16">Burgoon &#x0026; Buller, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_21">2008</xref>), as a deceptive interaction is unfolding, people may become suspicious of being lied to and, in turn, may behave in certain ways because of it. In some cases, they may hide their suspiciousness. For example, at least two studies show that when we suspect that someone is lying to us, we alter our behavior so we don&#x2019;t look suspicious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_19">Buller, Strzyzewski, &#x0026; Comstock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_23">Burgoon, Buller, Dillman, &#x0026; Walther, 1995</xref>). Specifically, suspicious people tend to use shorter responses, take longer to answer, and manage their body movements more. In other situations, however, our behaviors may reveal our suspicion and, in turn, may affect our partner&#x2019;s behavior. Indeed, if someone who is lying to us thinks we are suspicious, the liar may try even harder to be convincing. Previous research has supported this notion, demonstrating that deceivers&#x2019; verbal and nonverbal behavior changes during the course of interactions, often becoming indistinguishable from truthful behavior well into the interaction (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_16">Burgoon &#x0026; Buller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_22">Burgoon &#x0026; Qin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_115">White &#x0026; Burgoon, 2001</xref>). On the other hand, one study found that interviewers who <target target-type="page" id="page_299">299</target>displayed a supportive demeanor during an interrogation encouraged truth tellers, but not liars, to provide more details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_81">Mann et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it is apparent that suspiciousness plays a role in both senders&#x2019; and receivers&#x2019; behaviors, does it affect people&#x2019;s ability to judge veracity? Research suggests the answer to this question is no. In other words, there appears to be a weak relationship between suspicion and the ability to discriminate lies from truths. To help understand why, imagine that a person is making a number of statements and you are trying to decide which of the statements are true and which are false. The <italic>opposing effects model</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_60">Kim &#x0026; Levine, 2011</xref>) suggests that suspicion decreases the truth bias. As such, being suspicious makes you more accurate when judging lies and less accurate when judging truths. Such opposing effects cancel each other out, making little difference in your overall ability to tell truths from lies. In short, suspicion helps you spot lies but misjudge truths.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12_3_1_7">
<title>Probing and Deception Detection</title>
<p>In the previous section we learned that when trying to detect deception, people sometimes try to alter their behavior so they don&#x2019;t look suspicious. But sometimes, probing a potential liar for more information may be necessary. To be sure, if a liar won&#x2019;t talk, it&#x2019;s difficult to find contradictions or inconsistencies in his or her story. Interestingly, however, most research indicates that probing suspects for more information (e.g., &#x201C;Tell me more about where you were when the book bag was stolen&#x201D;) does <italic>not</italic> increase the accuracy with which you can detect that suspect&#x2019;s deception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_19">Buller et al., 1991</xref>). Perhaps even more interesting is the fact that probing a suspect for more information causes third parties to perceive the suspect as more honest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_19">Buller et al., 1991</xref>). This phenomenon has been called the <italic>probing effect</italic> by those who study deception (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_69">Levine &#x0026; McCornack, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_70">1996b</xref>).</p>
<p>Although scholars agree that the probing effect occurs, there is some disagreement on what causes it. (For a more detailed debate, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_18">Buller, Stiff, &#x0026; Burgoon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_69">Levine &#x0026; McCornack, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_70">1996b</xref>.) For instance, several authors argue in favor of the <italic>behavioral adaptation explanation,</italic> which in a nutshell asserts that when probing occurs, liars realize they are suspected of lying and alter their behavior to be more believable. Levine and McCornack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_69">1996a</xref>), however, assert that this explanation is flawed and in one study found evidence that contradicts it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_71">Levine &#x0026; McCornack, 2001</xref>). In the study, liars were videotaped being probed. Afterward, research participants watched one of two versions of the videotaped liars. Both versions showed exactly the same footage of the liars, but one had the probes edited out. Interestingly, participants who watched the videos in which probes were deleted perceived liars to be significantly less honest than those who saw the probed liars. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_71">Levine and McCornack (2001)</xref> showed that the probing effect occurred, but not because liars changed their behaviors.</p>
<p>What, then, is responsible for the probing effect? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_71">Levine and McCornack (2001)</xref>, when trying to tell if someone is lying, judges often rely on shortcuts rather than on scrutinizing the behavior of the suspect. One shortcut judges rely on is called the <italic>probing heuristic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_71">Levine &#x0026; McCornack, 2001</xref>). Here&#x2019;s how it works. Imagine you&#x2019;re watching a suspect and trying to decide if he or she is lying or telling the truth. Also imagine that the suspect is being probed. Rather than scrutinize the suspect&#x2019;s words and behaviors, you use a shortcut. Specifically, you think to <target target-type="page" id="page_300">300</target>yourself: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s mighty difficult and nerve racking to lie while being probed, so, given the choice, people being probed will choose to tell the truth.&#x201D; Based on such thinking, you decide that people being probed are also being honest. Your judgment has nothing to do with the suspect&#x2019;s behavioral adaptation but rather a simple shortcut that saves you the effort of scrutinizing the suspect&#x2019;s behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_71">Levine &#x0026; McCornack, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Before concluding this section, we should note that others have questioned whether behavioral adaptation happens. For example, in contrast to behavioral adaptation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_36">Ekman (1985)</xref> suggests that an opposite phenomenon may occur: When suspected of deceit, a <italic>truthful</italic> communicator may become anxious. This, in turn, may cause a detector to commit what Ekman calls the <italic>Othello error&#x2014;</italic>that is, the detector wrongly assumes that the anxious behavior is indicative of deception. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_55">Henningsen, Cruz, and Morr (2000)</xref> supported this notion by finding that people who were perceived as nervous were also perceived as deceptive.</p>

<sec id="sec12_3_1_8">
<title>Eliciting Cues to Deception: Puttin&#x2019; the Squeeze On</title>
<p>Earlier in this chapter, we suggested that one possible way to improve deception detection is by training people to spot reliable cues to deception. A second, and, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_51">Hartwig and Bond (2011)</xref>, perhaps more promising strategy, is less passive in nature. Specifically, rather than simply observing a person&#x2019;s verbal and nonverbal cues, this approach actively attempts to increase behavioral differences between liars and truth tellers, thereby making them easier to distinguish from one another. Let&#x2019;s examine two techniques for doing so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12_3_1_9">
<title>The Imposing-Cognitive Load Approach: Too Much to Think About</title>
<p>The <italic>imposing-cognitive load approach</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_112">Vrij et al., 2011</xref>) is based on the assumption that lying is more mentally taxing than telling the truth (see above). As such, if you increase cognitive demands further, liars, who have fewer cognitive resources, will struggle more than truth tellers. By way of example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_113">Vrij, Mann, Fisher, Leal, Milne, and Bull (2008)</xref> asked liars and truth tellers to provide an account in either chronological or reverse chronological order. It turns out that liars who told the story backward were more detectable than those who told it from front to back, presumably because of increased cognitive load. Another study found that describing an event in different ways (i.e., verbally and pictorially) was more difficult for liars than for truth tellers. As such, liars were less consistent between descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_63">Leins, Fisher, &#x0026; Vrij, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12_3_1_10">
<title>Strategic Questioning: Designed to Trip You Up</title>
<p>A second approach suggests that specific types of interrogation questions may be particularly useful for detecting deceit. Consider, for example, the <italic>strategic use of evidence (SUE) technique</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_48">Granhag &#x0026; Hartwig, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_53">Hartwig et al., 2005</xref>). In it, interrogators who possess certain evidence about a case do not reveal that evidence, hoping instead that suspects will say something to contradict it. Later, the interrogator pounces, revealing the evidence and asking the suspect to explain the contradiction. Recent research indicates that revealing evidence late in the interrogation, rather than early or gradually, is most effective. Indeed, revealing evidence early or gradually <target target-type="page" id="page_301">301</target>allows a suspect to adapt. What&#x2019;s more, revealing evidence gradually causes innocent suspects to appear guilty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_105">Sorochinski, Hartwig, Osborne, Wilkins, Marsh, Kazakov, &#x0026; Granhag, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>A compatible approach suggests that deception detectors are more accurate when they consider <italic>context-sensitive information</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_66">Levine, Blair, and Clare, 2014</xref>). To illustrate, imagine that a middle-aged woman whom you know nothing about has just told you Nutrageous bars are her favorite type of candy. And then imagine a tiny, 5-year-old girl tells you that she has just been signed as the new quarterback for the Denver Broncos, her favorite football team. Assuming both people are lying, which would be easier to detect? Obviously, if you know anything about the typical size and demographics of professional football players, the little girl should be easier to detect. Indeed, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_6">Blair, Levine, and Shaw (2010)</xref>, when given meaningful information about context (e.g., professional football players are usually large males), the typical 50 percent detection rates we told you about at the beginning of this chapter increase drastically.</p>
<p>In fact, one series of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12_66">Levine et al., 2014</xref>) increased accuracy rates to over 70 percent! In the studies, students tried to win cash prizes while playing a trivia game with a teammate. Unbeknown to the students, however, their teammates were really part of the study. What&#x2019;s more, the teammates encouraged the students to cheat, which many of them did. Later, the students were interrogated using several questions that were strategically designed to garner diagnostically useful information about whether they were lying or telling the truth. For example:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>&#x201C;When I interview your partner, what will they say about cheating?&#x201D; (The rationale for asking this question: Liars, compared to truth tellers, should be less confident that their teammates will exonerate them).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x201C;For the answers you got right, explain how you got the right answer?&#x201D; (Rationale: Cheaters, compared to noncheaters, should feel the need to justify their performance).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x201C;If someone did cheat, what should happen to them?&#x201D; (Rationale: Cheaters, compared to noncheaters, should be more likely to suggest leniency).</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Given such research, it is clear that interrogation strategies can be vital when trying to detect deception.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Deception is a multifaceted and complex communication phenomenon that has been broadly conceptualized. In this chapter we explored some of these conceptualizations. We also learned that although people are not very good at detecting deception, some factors improve their accuracy. Other factors (e.g., the truth bias), however, can impede detection accuracy. We also examined some of the behaviors that distinguish truthful from deceptive individuals and some of the frameworks that explain such differences. Finally, we discussed various approaches for eliciting cues to deception.</p>

<p>IF REAL LIFE WERE A CARTOON, the salesperson who showed up at the home of one of the authors could have been Elmer Fudd. The author needed rain gutters on his house. On the advice of a neighbor, he contacted a company located a good 40 miles from where he lived to come out and provide an estimate. The salesperson, a paunchy fellow in his mid-40s, arrived in a beat-up clunker. He looked tired and disheveled as he got out. He fumbled with his clipboard, calculator, and an armload of gutter samples as he made his way up the sidewalk.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_310">310</target>&#x201C;Find the place okay?&#x201D; the author asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The diwections wuh gweat,&#x201D; the salesperson answered, &#x201C;but the twaffic was tewwible, and I got a ticket on the way.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s too bad,&#x201D; the author replied.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t have my seat belt on,&#x201D; the salesperson lamented, &#x201C;because it&#x2019;s bwoken, and it costs &#x0024;300 to fix. I can&#x2019;t affawd it wight now.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Owing to the salesperson&#x2019;s unkempt appearance, his speech impediment, and his sad tale, the author felt sympathetic. Even though the salesperson&#x2019;s estimate was slightly higher than those of several local businesses, the author signed a contract. How could he do otherwise? The salesperson had come all that way&#x2014;risked his life, in fact&#x2014;to provide an estimate. He&#x2019;d gotten a ticket for his trouble. The way the author saw it, the difference in the salesperson&#x2019;s price from that of the local competitors was probably less than the cost of the ticket. And the guy obviously needed the sale.</p>
<p>Or did he? After the salesperson drove away, the author began wondering if it were all a ruse. What if the salesperson told every potential customer he&#x2019;d gotten a ticket? What if his seat belt worked just fine? What if he faked or exaggerated the speech problem to elicit sympathy and help make the sale? The author never did find out whether the &#x201C;sad sack&#x201D; character was genuine or a guise, but the rain gutters have worked splendidly.</p>
<p>Whether the salesperson&#x2019;s strategy was honest or not, it&#x2019;s clear that his success was based, to a large extent, on pity. His sad story plucked at the author&#x2019;s heartstrings. And in the end, the author was willing to pay more because he felt sorry for the fellow. The salesperson&#x2019;s appeal to pity, if it were designed as such, represents but one example of a <italic>motivational appeal,</italic> the topic of this chapter. Motivational appeals may be generally defined as external inducements, often of an emotional nature, that are designed to increase an individual&#x2019;s drive to undertake some course of action. By external inducements, we mean incentives that exist apart from the substance of a message itself. Such external inducements typically seek to alter people&#x2019;s moods, feelings, or emotions as a means of persuasion.</p>
<sec id="sec13_1">
<title>Intrinsic Versus Extrinsic Motivation</title>
<p>Motivational appeals can be thought of as attempts to jump-start an individual&#x2019;s drive to do something. They provide an external incentive for performing some action. <italic>Intrinsic motivation</italic> is drive that comes from within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_31">Deci, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_32">Deci &#x0026; Ryan, 1978</xref>). If you &#x201C;live to work,&#x201D; your motivation for doing your job is internal. <italic>Extrinsic motivation</italic> is instilled by some outside factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_92">Petri, 1991</xref>). If you &#x201C;work to live,&#x201D; your motivation for going to work each day is external. All the motivational appeals we discuss here can be thought of as extrinsic in nature. Motivational appeals are found everywhere. Daily entreaties include anxiety, fear, guilt, health, honor, humor, patriotism, pity, pride, sex, warmth, and more. One might be tempted to think that all emotional appeals are ethically suspect. However, as Corbett and Conners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_29">1999</xref>) advise, &#x201C;there is nothing necessarily reprehensible about being moved to action through emotion; in fact, it is perfectly normal&#x201D; (p. 206). We begin with an examination of emotional appeals in marketing.</p>

<sec id="sec13_2_1">
<title>Emotions and the ELM</title>
<p>Emotions tend to exert more influence when receivers rely on peripheral processing, as opposed to central processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_51">Greifeneder, Bless, &#x0026; Pham, 2011</xref>). However, central processing and peripheral processing can coexist, a phenomenon known as <italic>parallel processing</italic>. A patient, for example, might perceive that her doctor was offering rational arguments for taking her medication and demonstrating empathy for her as well.</p>
<p>Emotions sometimes precede thinking. In such cases, a person&#x2019;s emotional state may bias subsequent thinking (Petty &#x0026; Bri&#x00F1;ol, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_93">2015</xref>). For example, if an art patron were in a foul mood before attending an art exhibit, the patron might decide the display was &#x201C;a pile of rubbish&#x201D; and the artist was a &#x201C;buffoon.&#x201D; Sometimes emotions follow thinking, in which case they tend to validate the thought process used (Petty &#x0026; Bri&#x00F1;ol, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_93">2015</xref>). For instance, a traveler who planned a trip carefully, might become elated as the date of departure neared.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13_2_2">
<title>Emotional Marketing</title>
<p>Marketers often design ad campaigns to elicit emotions such as fear, love, and regret in consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_6">Achar, So, Agrawal, &#x0026; Duhachek, 2016</xref>). According to <italic>attachment theory</italic>, people develop emotional ties to specific brands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_113">Thomson, MacInnis, &#x0026; Park, 2005</xref>). Apple products are a case in point. Mac, iPhone, and iPad owners share an emotional connection with their devices unlike that of their counterparts who use non-Apple products. Such emotional attachments enable marketers to engage consumers, making them passionate about, and loyal to, their brands.</p>
<p>In an episode of the popular television series <italic>Mad Men</italic>, advertising guru Don Draper clearly grasps this concept. His clients, from Kodak, want Draper to create an ad campaign that touts the technology of the new &#x201C;wheel&#x201D; on their slide projector. Draper advises them to drop the &#x201C;glittering lure&#x201D; of technology and establish a deeper emotional connection with consumers. Nostalgia, Draper stresses, is the key.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In Greek, nostalgia literally means the pain from an old wound. A twinge in your heart, far more powerful than memory alone. This device &#x2026; is a time machine. It goes backwards and forwards. It takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It&#x2019;s not called the wheel. It&#x2019;s called the carousel. It lets us travel the way a child travels. Around and around and back home again. To a place where we know we are loved.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_123">Weiner &#x0026; Veith, 2007</xref>)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<p>His pitch invokes the nostalgia he wants consumers to feel. The concept of a carousel establishes a sentimental bond between the consumer and the product.</p>
<p>Don Draper isn&#x2019;t the only one who understands the power of emotional marketing. Persuaders in the real world have acknowledged the effectiveness of motivational appeals for years. Traditional thinking on this topic suggested that such appeals are effective in some contexts but not in others. Specifically, traditionalists suggested that decisions, such as buying gasoline, a microwave, or detergent are more <italic>utilitarian</italic> in <target target-type="page" id="page_312">312</target>nature and are prompted by practical concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_12">Babin, Darden, &#x0026; Griffin, 1994</xref>). Other decisions, such as purchasing clothing or music, are more <italic>hedonic</italic> in nature and are driven more by pleasure seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_68">Khan, Dhar, &#x0026; Wertenbroch, 2005</xref>). Some decisions, like buying a car, are a mixture of both. A two-seater convertible may seem fun, but what if there are five people in the family?</p>
<p>More recently, however, thinking has shifted in favor of a greater role for emotion compared to reason. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_78">Livingston (2007)</xref>, for instance, argued that &#x201C;people buy for emotional reasons, and then justify their purchases with logic&#x201D; (p. 16). By way of example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_7">Adler, Iacobelli, and Gutstein (2016)</xref> found that positive emotional appeals outperformed positive rational appeals in an online persuasion context. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_45">Geuens, De Pelsmacker, and Faseur (2011)</xref> found that emotional ads outperformed nonemotional ads for both hedonic <italic>and</italic> utilitarian products. Some go so far as to say that all consumer purchases are dictated by emotion rather than reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_96">Robinette &#x0026; Brand, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>While we agree that emotions play an important role in persuasion, we don&#x2019;t believe that emotions rule all our decisions. A wealth of studies show that highly involved receivers favor high-quality arguments and evidence, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_94">Petty and Cacioppo (1986)</xref> call <italic>central processing</italic>. What&#x2019;s more, the distinction between logic and emotion is not altogether clear, as we point out next.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="sec13_3">
<title>Logical and Emotional Appeals: A Fuzzy Distinction</title>
<p>People often think of &#x201C;logical&#x201D; and &#x201C;emotional&#x201D; appeals as opposites. This distinction dates back to Aristotle, who classified <italic>logos</italic> (logic, reasoning) and <italic>pathos</italic> (passion, emotion) as separate, distinct forms of influence (Aristotle, trans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_11">1932</xref>). This way of thinking, however, represents something of an artificial dichotomy. Whether a message is perceived as logical or emotional has as much to do with the person <italic>perceiving</italic> the message as it does with the message itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_14">Becker, 1963</xref>). In fact, researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_41">Evans, Barston, &#x0026; Pollard, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_89">Oakhill &#x0026; Garnham, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_95">Reuchelle, 1958</xref>) have learned that when people agree with a message, they tend to perceive it as being more logical or rational in nature. When they disagree with a message, they tend to think of it as being more emotional in nature.</p>
<p>In an advertising context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_8">Akbari (2015)</xref> found that rational appeals were more effective for low-involvement products (sunscreen), while emotional appeals were more effective for high-involvement products (laptops). This finding was borne out in a meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_60">Hornik, Ofir, &#x0026; Rachamim, 2016</xref>) that showed emotional appeals are generally more effective than rational appeals. In addition, positive emotional appeals (humor, for example) were generally more effective than negative appeals (fear, guilt). Purely emotional ads, however, may capture consumers&#x2019; attention, without persuading them.</p>

<title>Fear Appeals: If You Don&#x2019;t Stop Doing that, You&#x2019;ll Go Blind</title>
<p>&#x201C;If you cross your eyes, they&#x2019;ll stay that way.&#x201D; &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t run with scissors, you&#x2019;ll poke your eye out.&#x201D; &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t stuff beans up your nose, they&#x2019;ll sprout.&#x201D; What child hasn&#x2019;t heard these or similar admonitions from a parent? When he was a little tyke, one of <target target-type="page" id="page_313">313</target>the authors put beans up his nose anyway. While having them removed at the doctor&#x2019;s office, he had to endure his mother&#x2019;s &#x201C;I told you so&#x201D; lecture.</p>
<p>Fear appeals are not only a staple of child-rearing, they are also prevalent in the workplace, in public health messages, advertising, and elsewhere. Advertisements for dandruff shampoos, deodorants, mouthwashes, and acne medications, for example, are often predicated on the fear of social ostracism. Pharmaceutical ads tell us to ask our doctor if a new prescription pill is right for us. Then those ads go on to describe a litany of side effects that sound worse than the original illness.</p>
<p>Some commentators charge that America has become a culture based on fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_9">Altheide, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_43">Gardner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_46">Glassner, 1999</xref>). Whether to sell products, garner votes, or increase ratings, persuaders use scare tactics to increase our anxiety about all sorts of things. We&#x2019;re afraid of exotic diseases such as Ebola, mad cow, and West Nile. We stress out about school shootings, child abductions, homeland security, and road rage. The world is a scary place.</p>
<p>When designed properly, fear appeals can be highly effective. Reviews of the fear appeal literature have shown that inducing fear can bring about changes in attitudes, intentions, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_19">Boster &#x0026; Mongeau, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_26">Cho &#x0026; Witte, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_58">Higbee, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_84">Mongeau, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_97">Ruiter, Abraham, &#x0026; Kok, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_110">Sutton, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_130">Witte &#x0026; Allen, 2000</xref>). But how and when do fear appeals work best? Two well-known models explain. We discuss these next.</p>
<sec id="sec13_4_1">
<title>The Stage Model: Scared Stiff</title>
<p>Natascha de Hoog and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_33">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_34">2008</xref>) developed a dual process model, known as the <italic>stage model</italic>, that explains how fear level or intensity works. According to the model, when a person is exposed to a fear-arousing message, the person engages in <italic>threat appraisal</italic> to assess the <italic>perceived severity</italic> of the threat and her or his <italic>perceived vulnerability</italic> to the threat. The stage model posits four possible threat conditions, based on the combination of low versus high severity and low versus high vulnerability to a threat (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13_1">Figure 13.1</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig13_1" position="float">
<label>Figure 13.1</label>
<caption><title>Stage model of fear-arousing communication.</title></caption>
<graphic orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fig13_1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>If both severity and vulnerability are seen as low, a person will tend to ignore the threat or rely on peripheral processing. For example, Simone, who lives in Manhattan, might know that bee stings hurt (mild severity), but if she&#x2019;s not allergic to them and doesn&#x2019;t spend much time trekking in meadows (low vulnerability), she might think, &#x201C;No big deal. I&#x2019;ll worry about it if it happens.&#x201D;</p>
<p>If a person perceives that a threat is severe, but vulnerability is low, the person will engage in moderate cognitive processing, mostly to make sure that the threat is assessed accurately. For example, Dieter, who lives in Stuttgart, might believe that Ebola is a deadly disease (high severity), but that there is little or no risk of contracting it in Germany (low vulnerability). He might be motivated to support eradication efforts in Africa, though, and health screening to prevent travelers from infected areas entering Germany. A converse scenario, with low severity, but high vulnerability, would also prompt moderate central processing. For example, Dieter is mindful of pickpockets on public transit, so he holds his backpack on his lap.</p>
<p>When perceived severity and perceived vulnerability are both high, <italic>defense motivation</italic> kicks in and the person utilizes central processing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13_1">Figure 13.1</xref>). Under defense motivation, a person actively scrutinizes the message and evaluates strategies for minimizing the harm. For example, suppose Alain lives in Nice, which was the <target target-type="page" id="page_314">314</target>target of a horrific terrorist attack in 2016. In that incident, a truck plowed into a crowd on Bastille day killing 86 people and injuring 434 more. As a resident of the French city, Alain might perceive that he and other residents are highly vulnerable to another deadly attack. In the high-severity/high-vulnerability condition, the person would examine the message carefully, not just to be clear about the threat, but to identify specific strategies for avoiding or minimizing the threat. The latter process is referred to as <italic>coping appraisal</italic>.</p>
<p>A person using coping appraisal would ask &#x201C;What can I do to avoid having this happen to me?&#x201D; In Alain&#x2019;s case, he would likely assess ways of reducing his risk during another attack. He could, of course, move to another city that is less likely to be targeted. He could also avoid places where large crowds congregate. &#x201C;Why make myself a target?&#x201D; he might reason. He might be vigilant about possible methods of attack; explosives, assault weapons, or vehicle ramming. He might increase his situational awareness by noting exits or avenues of escape in case of an emergency. He might still drink coffee at outdoor caf&#x00E9;s, but not sit street side or near glass windows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13_4_2">
<title>The Extended Parallel Process Model: Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself</title>
<p>When are people likely to use coping strategies? When are they more likely to panic? Although the stage model excels at explaining how threat level or intensity functions, we think another model is better at explaining how people actually respond to threats. Kim Witte&#x2019;s <italic>extended parallel processing model</italic> (EPPM) addresses these concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_82">Maloney, Lapinski, &#x0026; Witte, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_128">Witte, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_129">1994</xref>). According to the model, when a person encounters a fear-arousing message, the person can respond in one of three ways. Let&#x2019;s say a Japanese student, Mayumi, is thinking of visiting South Africa. Her friends, however, have expressed concerns about contracting a disease there. First, she might ignore the message altogether, believing she is not at risk. Mayumi might think to herself, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve traveled a lot and I&#x2019;ve never gotten seriously ill.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Second, if Mayumi perceives that she is at risk, she can try to avoid the danger. She would use <italic>danger control</italic>, by focusing on constructive ways of preventing or minimizing the threat. For example, there are vaccines that prevent hepatitis A and typhoid, two diseases that are found in South Africa. Malaria is also a risk, so she might wear insect repellent or avoid being outdoors at night.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_315">315</target>Third, Mayumi might fixate on her fear, which is a non-constructive response known as <italic>fear control</italic>. Fear control essentially involves &#x201C;worrying about worry.&#x201D; Such a reaction can result in panic. If she decided to visit South Africa anyway, but spent every moment riddled with fear, she would be engaged in fear control.</p>
<p>In the EPPM, danger control is a far more effective response because it focuses on the solution. Fear control, conversely, is counterproductive because it focuses on managing one&#x2019;s fear. A persuader&#x2019;s goal in using fear appeals, then, should be to arouse fear in a manner that triggers danger control rather than fear control.</p>
<p>Returning to our example, for danger control to occur, Mayumi must believe there is a clear course of action that she can take to avoid the threat. This element of the EPPM is called <italic>perceived efficacy</italic>. Perceived efficacy has two components. The first, <italic>response efficacy</italic>, has to do with whether there are effective steps for avoiding the harm. For example, Mayumi might reason that by staying current on immunizations and taking reasonable precautions, she can avoid contracting a disease. The second, <italic>self-efficacy</italic>, has to do with whether she, personally, is capable of taking those steps. If Mayumi is allergic to some vaccines, or she will be visiting rural areas with no potable water, or she will be sleeping outdoors at night, she may not believe she can avoid hepatitis A, typhoid, or malaria.</p>
<p>Both response efficacy and self-efficacy are important components of perceived efficacy. If both are present, a person is more likely to engage in danger control. If either is missing, the person is more likely to resort to fear control. Indeed, a meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_23">Casey, Timmermann, Allen, Krahn, &#x0026; Turkiewicz, 2009</xref>) demonstrated this very result: High-response efficacy and self-efficacy correlated significantly with greater condom use. At the point where &#x201C;perceptions of threat begin to outweigh perceptions of efficacy &#x2026; people begin to shift from danger control to fear control&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_82">Maloney, Lapinski, &#x0026; Witte, 2011</xref>, p. 210).</p>
<p>According to the stage model, then, fear appeals that heighten the perceived severity of, and vulnerability to, a threat, are most likely to succeed. According to the EPPM, identifying specific actions, that the target audience can perform, is essential too. An excellent summary of fear&#x2019;s effectiveness based on these and other models was provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_112">Tannenbaum, Hepler, Zimmerman, Saul, Jacobs, Wilson, and Albarracin (2015)</xref>. After reviewing 128 different studies on fear appeals, they concluded, &#x201C;fear appeals are particularly effective when the communication depicts relatively high amounts of fear, includes an efficacy message, stresses severity and susceptibility, recommends one-time only behaviors, and targets audiences that include a larger percentage of female message recipients&#x201D; (p. 1198).</p>
<p>We would be remiss if we didn&#x2019;t acknowledge that there are serious ethical concerns surrounding the use of fear appeals. We address these in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter16">Chapter 16</xref>. For the time being, suffice it to say that a persuader should exercise caution in using fear appeals. Nevertheless, if the harmful consequences are real or genuine, we would suggest it is not only acceptable for a persuader to employ fear appeals, but also that the persuader has an obligation to use them.</p>
<p>The beans, by the way, did not sprout.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_316">316</target>Negative Emotions: Woe Is Me, Shame On You</title>
<p>Persuaders often seek to stir negative emotions in people. Pity, guilt, and shame are three such negative emotions that can be leveraged to a persuader&#x2019;s advantage. Appeals involving these emotions are often interrelated. Becheur and Valette-Florence (2014), for example, found that a combination of guilt and shame was more effective than guilt alone in persuading young people, ages 18&#x2013;25, to limit their alcohol consumption. As another example, charitable organizations regularly air television spots portraying starving children or abused pets. The ads induce pity for the kids or animals and guilt in viewers for not donating. &#x201C;For just a few cents per day,&#x201D; the ads claim, &#x201C;you can make a difference.&#x201D; Is it possible for nonprofits to use a different approach? Absent pity ploys, guilt trips, and shaming, will people still donate?</p>
<p>One study suggests it may not be possible to have it both ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_37">Eayres and Ellis (1990)</xref> asked males and females to evaluate 10 posters for charitable causes that used different appeals. Some posters depicted people with mental disabilities in a negative light (dependent, incapable), whereas others portrayed them in a positive light (valued, capable). The researchers found that the negative depictions were most likely to induce participants to donate money. Participants were less likely to donate if the posters featured positive portrayals. As the researchers noted, &#x201C;this tends to validate the supposition that in order to produce a successful poster in charity terms it is necessary to play on people&#x2019;s feelings of guilt and pity&#x201D; (p. 356). Interestingly, the participants were more willing to become actively involved in, and donate time to, charitable causes that were featured positively in the posters. This bodes well for charities seeking increased voluntarism, but not for ones seeking monetary contributions.</p>
<p>On the subject of guilt itself, some researchers have found that invoking feelings of guilt in another person can facilitate compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_90">O&#x2019;Keefe, 2002</xref>). Inducing guilt made people more likely to comply with a subsequent request (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_42">Freedman, Wallington, &#x0026; Bless, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_57">Hibbert, Smith, Davies, &#x0026; Ireland, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_76">Lindsey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_77">Lindsey, Yun, &#x0026; Hill, 2007</xref>). Surprisingly, they were more likely to comply even if the person making the request, or the person benefiting from the request, was not the source of their guilt. However, other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_16">Bessarabova, Turner, Fink, &#x0026; Blustein, 2015</xref>) found that inducing guilt can be counterproductive. Stronger guilt appeals may produce <italic>psychological reactance</italic>, which refers to resistance to a perceived threat to one&#x2019;s freedom. According to Bessarabova et al., internally generated guilt is more effective than externally induced guilt.</p>
<p>A second caution regarding guilt appeals is that the target of the appeal may seek to avoid further interaction with the source, to avoid further embarrassment or minimize the risk of a confrontation. Guilt appeals should, therefore, be designed to emphasize the positive self-feelings that come from doing the right thing, rather than focusing on further loss of face.</p>
<p>There is a dark side to guilt appeals as well. Unscrupulous persuaders can use guilt appeals to extract money from people who are in mourning, as we point out in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box13_1">Box 13.1</xref>.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_317">317</target>Along the same lines, several investigations have examined people&#x2019;s emotional reactions to others who possess varying maladies or stigmas. How people react to others&#x2019; stigmas (obesity, paraplegia, blindness, AIDS, etc.) depends on the causal inferences they make about those stigmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_18">Blaine &#x0026; Williams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_124">Weiner, Perry, &#x0026; Magnusson, 1988</xref>). For example, these researchers analyzed college students&#x2019; emotional reactions to people with varying stigmas (obesity, drug addiction, etc.), based on how controllable the students thought the stigma was. Students expressed more feelings of guilt and sympathy if the stigma was uncontrollable (e.g., obesity ascribed to a glandular dysfunction) and more feelings of anger and reluctance to help if the stigma was controllable (e.g., obesity due to overeating). Thus, persuaders seeking to use emotional appeals such as pity or guilt for fundraising or other purposes need to ensure that the beneficiaries are <italic>not</italic> perceived as having a physical or social malady that they brought on themselves.</p>

<caption><title>Funeral Home Persuasion</title></caption>
<p>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t take it with you &#x2026; but you don&#x2019;t have to give it all to the mortuary!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Funerals are expensive. In the USA the price of a typical funeral is &#x0024;8,000-11,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_83">Miller, 2016</xref>, <uri>www.parting.com</uri>). A funeral is a &#x201C;distress purchase&#x201D; that is often made under emotional duress. Unfortunately, consumers are quite naive about funeral home practices. What&#x2019;s more, the process of negotiating the price of a funeral comes at the worst possible time: when thinking is impaired by the loss of a loved one. We may feel it is crass to engage in hard bargaining over prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_44">Gentry, Kennedy, Paul, &#x0026; Hill, 1995</xref>), but this is exactly why some unscrupulous funeral home directors try to take advantage of us. They know that a person who is grieving is an easy mark.</p>
<p>Not all, or even most, mortuaries prey on those who are grieving, but some clearly do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_118">Wasik, 1995</xref>). To increase your consumer awareness, and to arm you against the unscrupulous practices employed by some funeral homes, we offer the following list of dos and don&#x2019;ts when making funeral arrangements. The suggestions apply to a traditional burial. If cremation, burial at sea, or some other option is chosen, not all the suggestions will apply.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Do try to be as rational as possible. Grieve for the deceased with all your heart, but negotiate the price of the funeral with your head. A funeral home is a for-profit enterprise. You need to be a savvy consumer when negotiating the arrangements and the price.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Don&#x2019;t give in to guilt appeals, such as &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you think he/she deserves genuine brass handles on his/her coffin?&#x201D; The amount you love someone isn&#x2019;t measured by the amount you spend on that person&#x2019;s funeral. You can always spend more on that person later. For example, you could make a donation in the deceased&#x2019;s name to a worthwhile charity or social cause.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do conduct price comparisons, just as you would when buying a car or making any other major purchase. Websites such as Parting.com and FuneralDecision.com allow consumers to shop online. Telephone mortuaries and ask for quotes over the phone. The FTC now requires funeral homes to provide prices by phone. Ask what a complete funeral would cost, including embalming, casket, burial, flowers, and so on. If you don&#x2019;t feel up to making the calls, ask a trusted friend.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do ensure that everything you are promised is itemized in writing. The FTC now requires mortuaries to provide itemized prices. Don&#x2019;t take the funeral director&#x2019;s word for it if he or she says, &#x201C;leave it to us, we&#x2019;ll take care of everything.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do shop around for prices on caskets. Funeral homes mark up casket prices astronomically. You can save thousands of dollars by purchasing a casket factory-direct from a manufacturer, or even Costco, and having it delivered to the funeral home. Federal law requires funeral homes to accept a casket purchased elsewhere and prohibits the imposition of &#x201C;handling fees.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Don&#x2019;t pay for unnecessary frills. Rather than paying for brass handles, silk ruffles, or carved wood panels, consider personalizing the casket with family photos, poetry, or artwork. Decide what is within your budget and have the funeral director accommodate your needs. If the price isn&#x2019;t right, use outside vendors to provide additional services.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Don&#x2019;t pay more than you must for basic services. These include transporting the remains, embalming, a casket, interment, and a plot. Try calling around to see if the same services can be obtained more cheaply elsewhere. Cremation is a cheaper option than burial (no casket required, no plot or mausoleum, no gravestone or marker). To learn about what fees funeral homes may and may not charge legally, see <uri>www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0301-funeral-costs-and-pricing-checklist</uri></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Don&#x2019;t prepay for a plot, casket, or other services without discussing the contract with an attorney or accountant. Prepaid plans might seem like a good idea, but most consumer groups advise against them. If you change your mind about where you want to be buried, or how you want to be disposed of, it may be impossible to alter the contract or obtain a refund. You also lose the potential interest your money could earn in a bank account (see item 10).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do consider opening a &#x201C;Totten&#x201D; trust, a payable on-demand account at a bank or savings institution for the cost of a funeral. The trust is revocable, so it can be moved, altered, or closed completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_62">Jaffe, 1996</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do make use of helpful information sources. You can locate excellent advice and information on planning a funeral at <uri>www.funerals.org</uri>, <uri>www.clarkhoward.com</uri></p></list-item>

<title>Humorous Appeals: Stop Me If You&#x2019;ve Heard this One</title>
<p>You might not think of comedians as being particularly persuasive, but <italic>Time</italic> magazine&#x2019;s list of the 100 most influential people in 2017 included three comics: Samantha Bee, Leslie Jones, and Jordan Peele (<italic>Time</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_114">2017</xref>). An Egyptian comedian, Bassem Youssef, who is referred to as the &#x201C;John Stewart of Egypt,&#x201D; hosted a top-rated political satire show that lampooned the Egyptian government. He was arrested repeatedly for skewering powerful elites and eventually fled to the USA where he is now living in exile. In China, Zhou Libo, another comedian, used humor to draw attention to government corruption. In Paris in 2015, Al Queda terrorists gunned down the editor and staff members of the satirical magazine, <italic>Charlie Hebdo</italic>. Why? Because the magazine published cartoons critical of Islam.</p>
<p>Why do authoritarian governments and religious extremists fear comedians? Political satire is subversive. Beyond the laughs, comedians offer social commentary. &#x201C;Good comics,&#x201D; say <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_27">Cohen and Richards (2006)</xref> &#x201C;are playing an important function <target target-type="page" id="page_319">319</target>in society by holding up a mirror and forcing us to confront realities that we would prefer to ignore&#x201D; (para. 2).</p>
<p>The use of humor in persuasion is pervasive, and not just the political kind. Humorous advertisements account for 24 percent of all advertising in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_71">Laroche, Nepomuceno, Huang, &#x0026; Richard, 2011</xref>). Internet memes rely heavily on humor to offer pithy social and political commentary. Humor is common in the boardroom, the courtroom, the classroom, interpersonal conversations, and even the pulpit. Using humor to influence is like skinning a cat; there&#x2019;s more than one way. A humorous appeal can consist of a pun, satire, an anecdote, innuendo, irony, a metaphor, slapstick, or just a plain old joke, as in &#x201C;an armadillo walks into a bar &#x2026;&#x201D; Humor can be directed at oneself, which is known as <italic>self-disparaging humor,</italic> or at others. All in all, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_15">Berger (2011)</xref> identified 45 different types of humor.</p>
<sec id="sec13_6_1">
<title>Humor as an Indirect Form of Influence: All Kidding Aside</title>
<p>Typically, jokes themselves don&#x2019;t persuade. Humor tends to operate in a more roundabout manner using the peripheral route to persuasion. Two well-established ways in which humor assists persuasion are by <italic>capturing attention</italic> and <italic>increasing liking</italic> for the source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_40">Eisend, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_54">Gulas &#x0026; Weinberger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_88">Nabi, Moyer-Gus&#x00E9;, &#x0026; Byrne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_121">Weinberger &#x0026; Gulas, 1992</xref>). This explains why comedians like Ellen DeGeneres, Tina Fey, Jim Gaffigan, and Jerry Seinfeld are popular endorsers. A meta-analysis of humor in advertising revealed that humor was highly effective in increasing attention and positive feelings toward a brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_38">Eisend, 2009</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_320">320</target>A third way in which humor may facilitate persuasion is by serving as a <italic>distraction</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_88">Nabi, Moyer-Gus&#x00E9;, &#x0026; Byrne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_109">Strick, Holland, van Baaren, &#x0026; van Knipperberg, 2012</xref>). Specifically, because the cognitive effort required to comprehend a joke trades off with the mental energy needed to analyze the substance of a message, humor tends to suppress <italic>counterarguing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_131">Young, 2008</xref>). For example, one study found that participants who read a series of jokes told by late-night comedians were less inclined to scrutinize the statements carefully, compared to a control group of participants who read nonhumorous versions of the same statements. This suggests that a persuader facing a hostile audience could use humor to &#x201C;soften up&#x201D; the crowd.</p>
<p>A fourth way in which humor may aid a persuader is by serving as a form of <italic>social proof</italic>, which involves modeling our behavior after the actions or reactions of others (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter6">Chapter 6</xref>). The use of &#x201C;laugh tracks&#x201D; or live audience laughter on television sitcoms illustrates this principle. Researchers have found that the perceived funniness of low- to medium-quality jokes can be enhanced by including canned laughter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_30">Cupchik &#x0026; Leventhal, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_73">Leventhal &#x0026; Cupchik, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_74">1976</xref>). Speakers often use &#x201C;shills&#x201D; or &#x201C;plants&#x201D; in an audience to initiate laughter or applause to help sway audience members.</p>
<p>Finally, the use of humor might affect perceptions of a source. One meta-analysis, for example, found that overall, humor tends to reduce perceptions of a source&#x2019;s credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_38">Eisend, 2009</xref>). That said, humorous sources are perceived as being more socially attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_87">Murnstein &#x0026; Burst, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_117">Wanzer, Booth-Butterfield, &#x0026; Booth-Butterfield, 1996</xref>) and more competent communicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_117">Wanzer et al., 1996</xref>). Our advice, then, would be to employ humor judiciously, tailoring your message to the audience, the situation, and your goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13_6_2">
<title>Self-Disparaging Humor: LOLing at Yourself</title>
<p>Should you ever make yourself the brunt of a humorous appeal? On one hand, it might seem that putting yourself down, even lightheartedly, would damage your image. On the other hand, it might seem that the ability to poke fun at yourself would bolster your image. Again, the answer depends on the type of image you are aiming to create. The ability to laugh at yourself demonstrates that you are friendly and good-natured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_50">Graham, Papa, &#x0026; Brooks, 1992</xref>). Presidential candidates often appear on late-night comedy shows. By showing a lighter side, they hope to seem more natural, genuine, and spontaneous.</p>
<p>Actual studies on self-disparaging humor have yielded mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_25">Chang &#x0026; Gruner, 1981</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_55">Hackman (1988)</xref> revealed that self-disparaging humor led to lower ratings of speaker competence. Our advice is to avoid self-disparaging humor if you think you have low credibility to begin with or if you need to bolster your credibility in the competence dimension. If you have moderate to high credibility to begin with, then making light of some of your human frailties might make you appear more genuine and good-natured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13_6_3">
<title>But Is Humor Persuasive?</title>
<p>Earlier attempts to determine whether the use of humor enhanced persuasion produced inconsistent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_54">Gulas &#x0026; Weinberger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_105">Skalski, Tamborini, Glazer, &#x0026; Smith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_121">Weinberger &#x0026; Gulas, 1992</xref>). This is understandable, given that humor takes many forms. And let&#x2019;s face it, some jokes are funnier than others. A recent meta-analysis, however, suggests that humor enhances at least two measures of persuasion: attitudes toward a brand and purchase intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_38">Eisend, 2009</xref>). Although humor may be effective, it doesn&#x2019;t appear to be superior to other appeals, such as fear and pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_115">Verma, 2009</xref>). An additional study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_88">Nabi, Moyer-Gus&#x00E9;, &#x0026; Byrne, 2007</xref>) also found that humorous appeals may benefit from a <italic>sleeper effect</italic>&#x2014; that is, humor may grow on people over time, leading to more persuasion later on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13_6_4">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_321">321</target>Maximizing Humor&#x2019;s Potential</title>
<p>Some advice for maximizing humor&#x2019;s persuasive potential seems in order. First, if you aren&#x2019;t good at telling jokes, don&#x2019;t. Another suggestion is to use <italic>related humor</italic>, which integrates the humor into the content of the message. <italic>Unrelated humor</italic>, such as a stand-alone joke, is not as effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_54">Gulas &#x0026; Weinberger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_121">Weinberger &#x0026; Gulas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_122">Weinberger &#x0026; Spotts, 1989</xref>). Another suggestion is to add gravitas toward the end of a humor-laden message. Let the audience know your message is not all fun and games. Stress the seriousness of the point you are trying to make through your use of humor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_88">Nabi, Moyer-Gus&#x00E9;, &#x0026; Byrne, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important piece of advice is <italic>don&#x2019;t overdo it</italic>. Too much humor may cause listeners to discount the message as little more than a joke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_52">Gruner, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_88">Nabi et al., 2007</xref>). After all, if you don&#x2019;t appear to take your own message seriously, why should others? Similarly, the use of inappropriate humor can decrease perceptions of credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_36">Derks, Kalland, &#x0026; Etgen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_86">Munn &#x0026; Gruner, 1981</xref>).</p>

<title>Pride and Patiotism: Turning Red, White, and Blue into Green</title>
<p>In the summer of 2016, Budweiser beer temporarily renamed itself, <italic>America</italic>. Skittles offered packages with red, white, and blue candies. M&#x0026;Ms followed suit with its own patriotic palette. If the trend continues, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_98">Schultz (2016)</xref> observed, &#x201C;Buyers might have to salute each time they walk into a grocery store.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Politicians are fond of wrapping themselves in the flag, standing next to veterans at public events, and declaring theirs to be the greatest nation on earth (whatever nation that happens to be). Does flag waving work? The answer is yes, quite well. Several investigations suggest that patriotic ploys are effective, when used appropriately. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_101">Seiter and Gass (2005)</xref>, for example, compared the tips earned by food servers who wrote a patriotic message (&#x201C;United We Stand&#x201D;) on patrons&#x2019; checks with a more traditional message (&#x201C;Have a Nice Day&#x201D;). Food servers who used the patriotic slogan earned significantly higher tips.</p>
<p>Even brief exposure to a patriotic emblem can sway people. Those who saw an American flag on a survey of voter attitudes shifted their attitudes in a more conservative direction. Voting intentions also leaned more toward the right after a single exposure to the flag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_22">Carter, Ferguson, &#x0026; Hassin, 2011</xref>). Why? As a patriotic symbol, the flag may be more closely associated with the Republican than the Democratic party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_65">Kalmoe &#x0026; Gross, 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_56">Han (1988)</xref> found that patriotism had a positive effect on consumers&#x2019; intentions to purchase domestic as opposed to foreign <target target-type="page" id="page_322">322</target>brands, but didn&#x2019;t necessarily alter their perceptions of brand quality or reliability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_91">Pedic (1990)</xref> discovered that nationalistic ads were more effective than non-nationalistic ads, but only if the receivers were themselves nationalistic.</p>
<p>In America, patriotic appeals have a lot going for them. Even so, recent evidence suggests that the effectiveness of flag waving may be wearing off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_125">Wellner, 2002</xref>). In the USA, there has been pushback against Trump&#x2019;s anti-immigration policies. Shepard Fairey&#x2019;s series of pro-diversity posters, entitled &#x201C;We the People&#x201D; illustrates this trend (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13_3">Figure 13.3</xref>).</p>

<p>Not only that, patriotic appeals can backfire, as Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s famous remark that patriotism is the &#x201C;last refuge of scoundrels&#x201D; warns. Companies can still use American branding successfully, but if a persuader appears to be &#x201C;cashing in&#x201D; on patriotic ploys or using patriotism as a wedge issue, then receivers may reject the message or the source.</p>

<title>For Mature Audiences: Sex Appeals</title>
<p>Television is replete with sexual appeals. So are print ads. One analysis found that half of all print ads depict women as sex objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_107">Stankiewicz &#x0026; Rosselli, 2008</xref>). And then there&#x2019;s the Internet. There&#x2019;s more sex on the Web than flies on a cowpie. &#x201C;Sex sells,&#x201D; goes the advertising adage.</p>
<p>Although the use of sexual appeals has been a fixture of advertising for decades, two things have changed. First, the use of more overt sexual appeals has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_81">Malik, 2016</xref>). Second, increasingly younger audiences are being targeted. Media is sexualizing children at younger and younger ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_10">American Psychological Association, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_59">Hill, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_323">323</target>Historically, females have been depicted as sex objects in advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_106">Snigda &#x0026; Venkatesh, 2011</xref>), a situation decried by feminists and other media critics. Grounded in <italic>objectification theory,</italic> females are more likely to be seen as objects or things. Accordingly, females are more likely than males to be portrayed as passive, submissive, and subordinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_80">Mager &#x0026; Helgeson, 2011</xref>). Women also are depicted as being disembodied, silenced, and occupying less space than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_28">Conley &#x0026; Ramsey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_39">Eisend, 2010</xref>). Not surprisingly then, women respond less favorably to sex appeals than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_17">Black &#x0026; Morton, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the media&#x2019;s obsession with sex appeals, studies show that simply increasing the amount of sexual imagery does not make a message more persuasive. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_79">Ma and Gal (2016)</xref> warn, &#x201C;in general, research has found that sex in advertising does not improve brand recall or sales effectiveness&#x201D; (p. 479).</p>
<p>The sexual objectification of males is also well underway (Sexualization of men, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_104">2016</xref>). For example, the Magic Mike franchise, starring Channing Tatum, rides the current wave of toned dudes. David Beckham is hunky in H&#x0026;M&#x2019;s underwear ads. Duckett (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_20">Brown, 2016</xref>) emphasized that &#x201C;the trend for using hyper-athletic male models and celebrities in advertising has grown significantly in recent years, giving rise to the term &#x2018;hunkvertising&#x2019;&#x201D; (para. 7). And while one in six males under 24 reported being more self-conscious about their bodies, more than half of males said they pay little attention to male advertising physiques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_20">Brown, 2016</xref>). Men, therefore, have far less reason to worry about women ogling them than women do from the &#x201C;male gaze.&#x201D;</p>
<sec id="sec13_8_1">
<title>How Sex Sells</title>
<p>How do sex appeals work? Typically, the unspoken message in ads employing sexual appeals is either (1) if you use product &#x201C;X&#x201D; you will look, act, or feel more sexy or (2) if you use product &#x201C;X&#x201D; other sexy people will be attracted to you. Of course, such ads rarely make explicit cause&#x2013;effect claims about the benefits of the product. Rather, the product is paired with sexually laden imagery. Through this associative process (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter3">Chapter 3</xref>) the receiver comes to identify the product with sexiness or sensuality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13_8_2">
<title>Caveats and Cautions</title>
<p>Although it is true that sexual appeals can be effective, there are also cautions regarding their use (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_103">Sengupta &#x0026; Dahl, 2008</xref>). First, despite their prevalence, sex appeals are not always effective. A study conducted in a pharmaceutical sales context found that a female sales representative who showed cleavage was no more persuasive than a female salesperson who did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_47">Glick, Chrislock, Petersik, Vijay, &#x0026; Turek, 2008</xref>). Context means a lot, however. A study conducted in France found that males were much more likely to approach a female in a bar if she had large breasts (Gu&#x00E9;gu&#x00E9;n, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_53">2007</xref>). Who says research has to be boring? The conclusion might seem obvious. The point is that sex appeals may not function the same way in professional settings as they do in social settings. A boardroom is not a barroom.</p>
<p>Second, in some cases the targeted audience may resent the use of sexual appeals. For example, sexual stimuli are frequently included in ads aimed at women. Yet if women perceive the ads as sexist, the ads may backfire. Nowadays, an advertiser <target target-type="page" id="page_324">324</target>must walk a fine line between creating ads that are considered sexy and ads that are considered sexist.</p>

</fig>
<p>A third liability in using sex appeals is that they may function as a <italic>distraction</italic>, inhibiting receiver recall. If a consumer is salivating over a sexy model in a magazine ad, his or her attention may be diverted from the product being advertised. Several studies have shown this to be the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_21">Bushman &#x0026; Bonacci, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_64">Judd &#x0026; Alexander, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_81">Malik, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_108">Steadman, 1969</xref>). Advertisers face something of a dilemma here: A sexual appeal that is too mild may not stand out in the crowd, yet a sexual appeal that is too strong may serve as a distraction.</p>
<p>A fourth downside to using sex appeals is that they may produce undesirable social consequences. Objectification of women in media can lead to <italic>self-objectification</italic>, whereby females begin viewing themselves as objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_106">Snigda &#x0026; Venkatesh, 2011</xref>). This, in turn, may result in lower self-esteem, negative body image, and eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_28">Conley &#x0026; Ramsey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_69">Kilbourne, 1999</xref>). We don&#x2019;t fault the media entirely for the current obsession that people have with their bodies. We do think, however, that advertisers, the movie industry, and the fashion industry must shoulder some of the blame for exploiting people&#x2019;s insecurities about their looks.</p>

<title>Warmth Appeals: Straight from the Heart</title>
<p>&#x201C;Nothing says lovin&#x2019; like something from the oven, and Pillsbury says it best.&#x201D; Some advertisements convey a warm, cozy feeling. They emphasize family, friends, and a sense of belonging. They make us feel sentimental or nostalgic about life. Such ads are based on <italic>warmth.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_1">Aaker and Bruzzone (1981)</xref> identify warmth as one of a half-dozen basic dimensions people use to describe advertisements. The use of warmth in <target target-type="page" id="page_325">325</target>advertising is quite common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_5">Aaker, Stayman, &#x0026; Hagerty, 1986</xref>). A little more than one in five prime-time commercials include warmth as an advertising theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_3">Aaker &#x0026; Stayman, 1990</xref>). State Farm&#x2019;s &#x201C;Like a good neighbor &#x2026; State Farm is there&#x201D; campaign is based on this theme, as is Olive Garden&#x2019;s &#x201C;When you&#x2019;re here, you&#x2019;re family&#x201D; slogan. So are ads for Hallmark cards, &#x201C;Poppin&#x2019; Fresh,&#x201D; the Pillsbury doughboy, and Snuggle fabric softener, which features a cuddly teddy bear. Insurance companies, airlines, health-care providers, restaurants, and hotel chains all use warmth to convey images of folksiness, hominess, friendliness, and familiarity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_48">Goldman &#x0026; Papson, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>So how do they work? Primarily through association. A product or service is associated with the image of being warm, caring, or friendly. When we think of that product or service we get a warm-fuzzy feeling.</p>
<p>Warmth appeals aren&#x2019;t limited to television advertising. One study found that parental warmth was more effective in influencing adolescents&#x2019; eating habits than the use of negative pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_72">Lessard, Greenberger, &#x0026; Chen, 2010</xref>). Real-estate listings often use words like <italic>charming</italic>, <italic>cozy</italic>, or <italic>rustic</italic> to describe houses that are for sale. Restaurants boast of &#x201C;home-style&#x201D; cooking. Frozen foods claim to be based on &#x201C;authentic family recipes&#x201D; that are &#x201C;made the old-fashioned way.&#x201D; In interpersonal encounters, warmth can be conveyed through actions that generate a sense of friendship, bonding, or camaraderie. The Walmart &#x201C;greeter&#x201D; is a living embodiment of a warmth appeal. When a food server introduces himself or herself by name and smiles, the food server is also conveying warmth.</p>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_326">326</target>Warmth appeals can be quite effective, but their success depends on their believability. The warm-fuzzy images being portrayed must come across as sincere for the appeal to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_2">Aaker &#x0026; Stayman, 1989</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_3">Aaker and Stayman (1990)</xref> note, the appeal &#x201C;need[s] to avoid creating the perception of an ad&#x2019;s being phony, pointless, or contrived; such perceptions could interfere with the emotional response&#x201D; (p. 59). Warmth appeals, then, are a persuader&#x2019;s friend. They offer a positive approach to using motivational appeals by engendering warm, happy feelings in receivers.</p>

<title>Ingratiation: Polishing the Apple</title>
<p>You may know it as &#x201C;brownnosing,&#x201D; &#x201C;sucking up,&#x201D; or &#x201C;boot-licking,&#x201D; but <italic>ingratiation</italic> is the term researchers use for flattery as a motivational inducement. Ingratiation has been thoroughly studied in organizational settings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_35">Deluga &#x0026; Perry, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_75">Liden &#x0026; Mitchell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_111">Tal-Or, 2010</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_126">Westphal and Shani (2016)</xref> report that &#x201C;ingratiation is perhaps the most widely studied form of interpersonal influence behavior in the organization literature&#x201D; (p. 481). Will flattery get you everywhere? An overall assessment of the research to date suggests that ingratiation works&#x2014;and works well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_49">Gordon, 1996</xref>). For instance, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_119">Watt (1993)</xref> found that ingratiators were perceived by their supervisors as being more competent, more motivated, and more qualified for leadership positions than their noningratiating counterparts. Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_120">Wayne, Kacmar, &#x0026; Ferris, 1995</xref>) found that the use of ingratiation tactics by subordinates resulted in higher satisfaction for the supervisor and co-workers. In fact, one study quantified the advantage enjoyed by ingratiators over noningratiators. In a study of 152 pairs of managers and employees, Deluga (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_67">Kelleher, 1997</xref>) found that ingratiators enjoyed a 5 percent edge over noningratiators in getting favorable evaluations. Ziemke and Brodksy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_132">2015</xref>) found that the use of ingratiation by defense attorneys during their closing arguments increased their perceived attractiveness, likability, and credibility. Two studies in organizations&#x2014;one conducted in restaurants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_99">Seiter, 2007</xref>), the other in hair styling salons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_100">Seiter &#x0026; Dutson, 2007</xref>)&#x2014;found that food servers and hair stylists earned significantly higher tips when they complimented (ingratiated) their customers than when they did not.</p>
<p>Researchers know that ingratiation works, but just how does it work? What is the secret behind its success? There are three interrelated explanations for ingratiation&#x2019;s effectiveness (Dubrin, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_67">Kelleher, 1997</xref>). First, ingratiatory behavior tends to increase <italic>liking</italic> (&#x201C;I love that outfit on you!&#x201D;). Second, ingratiatory behavior can create perceptions of <italic>similarity</italic> (&#x201C;You love polka music? Hey, I do too!&#x201D;). Third, ingratiation can work through <italic>social labeling.</italic> The use of positive social labels (&#x201C;You sure are in a good mood today,&#x201D; &#x201C;You are so thoughtful&#x201D;) can produce changes in the target&#x2019;s self-concept that, in turn, lead to changes in the target&#x2019;s behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_70">Kraut, 1973</xref>). The person being ingratiated thus lives up to the positive label bestowed on her or him.</p>
<p>How many kinds of ingratiation are there? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_63">Edward Jones (1963)</xref>, who authored the first major work on ingratiation, identified three basic categories of ingratiation. The first is <italic>other enhancement,</italic> such as paying compliments or engaging in flattery. A derivative of this technique is to have a third party deliver the compliment, so that it seems more genuine (&#x201C;Biff speaks highly of you. He says you are the nicest boss he&#x2019;s <target target-type="page" id="page_327">327</target>ever had&#x201D;). The second technique is <italic>opinion conformity.</italic> This involves agreeing with the target&#x2019;s statements, ideas, and views. A variation on this technique is to initially disagree, then subsequently yield, creating the impression the target has changed your mind (&#x201C;Okay, you&#x2019;ve convinced me, Godiva chocolates taste better than See&#x2019;s chocolates&#x201D;). A third approach is <italic>self-presentation.</italic> This involves bragging or otherwise displaying one&#x2019;s attributes to increase the target&#x2019;s evaluation of oneself (&#x201C;Gee, I&#x2019;d love to play golf with you, but I&#x2019;m helping at the homeless center this weekend&#x201D;). Some scholars include <italic>performing favors</italic> as a fourth type of ingratiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_133">Zin, Ngah, Ismail, Tajuddin, Abdullah, &#x0026; Salleh, 2010</xref>). So you see, there is more than one way to engage in brownnosing.</p>
<p>But, you might ask, wouldn&#x2019;t the other person <italic>know,</italic> or at least suspect, that the ingratiator was trying to curry favor? If so, can ingratiation backfire? The answer is yes, although some studies find that shameless ingratiation still works, though perhaps not as well (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_24">Chan &#x0026; Sengupta, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on the &#x201C;slime effect&#x201D; suggests that inept ingratiators are seen as unlikable and are suspected of ulterior motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_116">Vonk, 1998</xref>). In one study, for example, food servers who delivered compliments to large parties in one fell swoop (&#x201C;You all made good choices!&#x201D;) received lower tips than food servers who complimented smaller parties, thereby seeming more sincere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_102">Seiter &#x0026; Weger, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>That said, some ingratiators are more skilled at disguising their motives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_126">Westphal and Shani (2016)</xref>, for instance, found that effective ingratiators self-regulate their thought process to focus on the positive characteristics of another person, rather than on his or her negatives. Successful ingratiators also rely on more subtle forms of flattery, such as turning a compliment as a question&#x2014;e.g., &#x201C;Ralph, you&#x2019;re always dressed sharp. Do you think I should wear black or brown shoes with a blue suit?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Considering such manipulative tactics, you might be thinking that ingratiation is an unethical influence strategy. We tend to agree, but not in all cases. If the ingratiator <italic>believes</italic> in the praise he or she is offering, we see no ethical problem in focusing on the positive side of things. Indeed, if the praise is genuine, this strategy offers the prospect for a &#x201C;win&#x2013;win&#x201D; communication encounter. We discuss the ethical implications of ingratiatory behavior in more detail in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter16">Chapter 16</xref>.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_328">328</target>Mixed Emotions: Other Appeals and Combinations of Appeals</title>
<p>There are many other types of motivational appeals that we do not have space to cover here. Some of these include appeals to honor, youth, beauty, shame, freedom, and the environment. Almost any human drive or emotion can serve as the basis for a motivational appeal.</p>
<p>Motivational appeals also can be used in combination. A threat of punishment can be coupled with a promise of reward, for example. A prosecutor might tell a defendant, &#x201C;If you cooperate, I&#x2019;ll cut you a deal. If you don&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll throw the book at you.&#x201D; The &#x201C;good cop/bad cop&#x201D; technique used in police interrogations also combines positive and negative appeals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_61">Inbau, Reid, &#x0026; Buckley, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_66">Kassin &#x0026; McNall, 1991</xref>). One study found that adding humor to a fear appeal about skin cancer reduced defensiveness by providing a &#x201C;margin of safety&#x201D; to the audience (Mukherjee &#x0026; Dub&#x00E9;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_85">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Guilt is commonly coupled with pity in charity fund-raisers (&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t help, who will?&#x201D;). In a twist involving &#x201C;strange bedfellows,&#x201D; the animal rights group known as PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has collaborated with <italic>Penthouse</italic> magazine for the past few years to produce an anti-fur advertisement. The ads feature sexy supermodels who proclaim they would rather go naked than wear fur, thus combining a sex appeal with a guilt appeal. Evidence suggests that when people experience mixed emotions, they don&#x2019;t recall them clearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_4">Aaker, Drolet, &#x0026; Griffin, 2008</xref>). For example, riding a roller coaster might evoke positive (e.g., excitement, exhilaration) and negative (e.g., fear, apprehension) emotions. Over time, though, the person would tend to remember the ride as mostly exciting and enjoyable or mostly scary and unpleasant.</p>
<p>We see definite advantages in combining appeals. If one appeal proves ineffective, another may still work. And there is always the prospect that combinations of appeals will have an additive effect&#x2014;that is, the combination of appeals may work better than they would individually. A danger in combining appeals is that they may appear contradictory or cancel one another out. Combining humor with pity, for instance, might create the appearance that a persuader was insensitive or disingenuous. Some research suggests that inducing conflicting emotions (happiness and sadness) may be better suited for Asian American than Anglo-American receivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13_127">Williams &#x0026; Aaker, 2002</xref>). In selecting motivational appeals, then, a persuader must be judicious.</p>

<sec id="sec13_12">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Motivational appeals are external inducements used to increase another&#x2019;s drive to do something. The use of motivational appeals is an omnipresent phenomenon. Attempts at casting logical and emotional appeals as opposites are suspect. Although motivational appeals aren&#x2019;t necessarily rational, neither are they irrational. Eight types of motivational appeals were discussed: fear, pity, guilt, humor, patriotism, sex, warmth, and ingratiation. These represent only a fraction of the appeals available to persuaders. Experimental studies have shown some of these to be highly effective in facilitating persuasion, whereas others have been shown to be less effective. It also was suggested that motivational appeals can be successfully combined if certain precautions are followed.<target target-type="page" id="page_329">329</target></p>

<p>WANT TO CAPTURE AN AUDIENCE&#x2019;S ATTENTION? Try taking off your clothes. You wouldn&#x2019;t be the first to use this approach. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) use this strategy to protest wearing leather and fur. Their &#x201C;Naked Truth&#x201D; campaign features attractive models and celebrities, sans clothing, with the caption &#x201C;I&#x2019;d rather go naked than wear fur.&#x201D; Not to be outdone, Spencer Tunick, a performance artist/photographer convinced 18,000 people in Mexico City to strip naked for a photo shoot. He sees mass nudity as a form of collective defiance against social norms. Nudity, however, is not reserved for <target target-type="page" id="page_337">337</target>protesters and artists. When a German supermarket offered free groceries to the first 100 naked shoppers, more than 200 people showed up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_83">Zimmerman, 2012</xref>). The promotion worked! We suspect that the male shoppers avoided the frozen food aisle.</p>
<p>Hang on. Before you give your next class presentation in the buff, we should warn you that while nudity may be a great attention getter, your &#x201C;visual aids&#x201D; may serve as a distraction during the rest of your presentation. Moreover, you may encounter a good deal of audience resentment. Lots of folks tend to react negatively to nudity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_16">Christy &#x0026; Haley, 2008</xref>). With that said, and, now that we have your attention, we&#x2019;d like to examine the role of images in persuasion.</p>
<sec id="sec14_1">
<title>Image is Everything</title>
<p>We are living in an increasingly visual society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_33">Gurri, Denny, and Harms (2010)</xref> underscored this trend, commenting that &#x201C;Many more images than ever before are available, and many more people are paying a disproportionate amount of attention to them&#x201D; (p. 101). Fewer people are reading newspapers and books. More people are watching movies and TV. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_56">Metros (2008)</xref> observed:
<disp-quote>
<p>politicians wage campaigns not on issues, but through their visual persona; wars are televised live through the eyes of embedded journalists; criminal trials have become 24/7 international spectator events; newspapers have had to reduce text to pack their pages with charts, graphics, and photos to compete for market-share; and even radio directs its listeners to Web sites to illustrate the spoken word.</p>
<attrib>(p. 109)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In television commercials, magazine ads, and billboards, images are primary and words are secondary. Politicians worry about &#x201C;bad optics,&#x201D; such as being on vacation when a crisis unfolds. The Internet is chock-full of images. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and other social media are saturated with images. Internet memes are ever popular. Selfies are all the rage. And it is not only mass media that rely on visual cues. Protest marches, sit-ins, demonstrations, rallies, and picketing are highly visual acts that are intended to persuade.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we examine some of the important ways in which images shape beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. First, we consider the importance of visual stimuli and how images persuade. Next, we examine art as a form of persuasion, cinematic influence, images in advertising, and photojournalism as a form of persuasion.</p>

<title>Overlooked and Under-Appreciated</title>
<p>&#x201C;Visual images,&#x201D; writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_74">Taewon Suh (1999)</xref>, &#x201C;have become a predominant means of transmitting information in the twentieth century and may be even more so in the next century&#x201D; (p. 3). Yet, despite the increasing importance of visual persuasion, the topic has been under-studied in the field of communication. Traditionally, the study of persuasion has focused on influence attempts that take place within the world of words. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_54">Messaris (1997)</xref> underscored this point when he noted:
<disp-quote>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_338">338</target>although the study of persuasive communication has a history of more than two millennia, the focus of this scholarly tradition has tended overwhelmingly to be on verbal strategies. With a few notable exceptions, the systematic investigation of visual persuasion is still in its infancy.</p>

<title>The Power of Images: A Thousand Words</title>
<p>Images are powerful. They can move us in ways that words cannot. Their potency stems partly from their perceived &#x201C;realness,&#x201D; or the idea that seeing is believing. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_33">Gurri, Denny, and Harms (2010)</xref> noted, &#x201C;with visual media, however, the illusion is created that we are gazing out a window at the real world&#x201D; (p. 102). The power of images also arises from their emotional force. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_40">Joffe (2008)</xref> emphasized the advantages of images over words when she noted that &#x201C;the most salient distinction between the relative effects of textual/verbal versus visual messages concerns their emotive impact&#x201D; (p. 84). The grim photo of a Sudanese infant starving to death (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14_1">Figure 14.1</xref>) demonstrates this capacity. The ghoulish image won a Pulitzer Prize in 1993.</p>

<p>Despite the traditional emphasis on words, studies have revealed a <italic>picture superiority effect</italic> for images. Pictures are more easily recognized and recalled than words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_39">Hockley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_60">Pelli, Farell, &#x0026; Moore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_72">Stenberg, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_53">Medina (2014)</xref> reports, for example, that people remember only about 10 percent of what they hear three days hence, compared to 65 percent recall when pictures are included. Images also cross languages and cultures more easily.</p>

<sec id="sec14_4">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_339">339</target>How Images Persuade</title>
<p>What is it about images and other visual stimuli that make them so persuasive? We take up this question here. In doing so, we rely heavily on Paul Messaris&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_54">1997</xref>) conceptualization of the role of images in persuasion. He suggests that images persuade in three basic ways: through <italic>iconicity, indexicality,</italic> and <italic>syntactic indeterminacy.</italic></p>
<sec id="sec14_4_1">
<title>Iconicity: Bearing a Resemblance</title>
<p>One way that images persuade is by functioning as <italic>icons</italic>, which simply means that they stand for and resemble the things they represent. An image can sum up a concept. The stick figure on a &#x201C;pedestrian crossing&#x201D; sign is an icon. An emoji is an icon for an emotion. A caricature of a politician drawn by an editorial cartoonist is also iconic. The Statue of Liberty, Uncle Sam, and the bald eagle are all icons of America. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether they are accurate representations or not (silhouettes of pedestrians on a crossing sign lack hands and feet) as long as people understand what they represent. This is, perhaps, the most important property of images: to summarize ideas and concepts. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_54">Messaris (1997)</xref> noted, &#x201C;If there is one property that most clearly distinguishes pictures from language and other modes of communication, that property is iconicity&#x201D; (p. 3).</p>
<p>A good illustration of the iconic nature of images can be found in Philip Morris&#x2019;s Marlboro man. The Marlboro man is immediately recognizable around the world. He is a mythical American hero. He represents the Old West. He symbolizes an idealized image of the cowboy&#x2014;a rugged, self-reliant individual. He&#x2019;s always pictured outdoors, on the range. Without even seeing the brand-name or the slogan, most people can spot the Marlboro man in an instant. And boy, can he sell cigarettes! Marlboro cigarettes are the most popular brand in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_21">de Guzman, 2007</xref>). For this reason, the Marlboro man has been called &#x201C;the most universally recognized, consistently profitable, and aesthetically appealing image in the advertising world&#x201D; (Selling tobacco, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_67">1990</xref>, p. 84). Now that&#x2019;s an icon.</p>
<p>As part of their iconic nature, images also can be selective. Lighting, camera angle, perspective, distance, cropping, and editing all figure into what a viewer sees. Ads for Weightwatchers and Nutrisystem, for example, can choose which &#x201C;before&#x201D; and &#x201C;after&#x201D; photos to show.</p>
<p>Another iconic function of images is that they can violate the reality they represent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_54">Messaris, 1997</xref>). An image can make something look real that isn&#x2019;t. For example, a busy mother who has her hands full doing the laundry, cooking dinner, cleaning house, and taking care of the kids could be pictured with four arms rather than two. An ad for a pain reliever might show someone suffering from a splitting headache, whose head actually appears to be splitting in two. Images can thus simulate a reality that doesn&#x2019;t exist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14_4_2">
<title>Indexicality: Seeing Is Believing</title>
<p>A second way in which images persuade is through <italic>indexicality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_54">Messaris, 1997</xref>). This refers to the ability of images, in particular photos and video, to document that an event happened or that something took place. For example, photos of Iraqi detainees being abused by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison or images of Syrian <target target-type="page" id="page_340">340</target>children killed by U.S. drone missile strikes function as &#x201C;proof&#x201D; to many in the Middle East that the United States does not value Muslim lives.</p>
<p>Indexical images often function as a form of sign reasoning or circumstantial evidence. For example, a high school yearbook photo might document who was in the glee club. An image of a zipper-shaped scar down the center of a person&#x2019;s chest is evidence the person had open heart surgery. Airline passenger &#x201C;shaming&#x201D; photos verify that some travelers, like the slob in seat 15A with his bare foot on your arm rest, are disgusting reprobates. A poignant example of indexicality involves police shootings that have been recorded by witnesses on smartphones or dashboard cameras. Such footage contributed to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_18">Cornelis &#x0026; Peter, 2017</xref>) demonstrated that consumers consider the veracity of images when evaluating products. Female respondents rated photos of models with labels stating that &#x201C;the model in this ad has been retouched&#x201D; versus &#x201C;the model in this ad has <italic>not</italic> been retouched&#x201D; versus no label. The photos labeled as not retouched were perceived as more authentic and increased purchase intentions.</p>
<p>The documentary aspect of images, however, also can be misleading. Pictures are not always faithful representations of reality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_32">Gunning (2004)</xref> refers to the common misconception that &#x201C;the camera never lies&#x201D; as the <italic>truth claim</italic> of photography. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_54">Messaris (1997)</xref> cautioned, &#x201C;photographs, of course, can lie. The picture of a model in a fashion ad can be made more attractive through airbrushing, and voter interviews or product demonstrations can be staged&#x201D; (p. xvii). A controversy over what images do or do not prove involved the size of the crowd at Trump&#x2019;s presidential inauguration. Although Trump declared his audience was the largest in history, the National Park Service released photos that challenged that claim. You can judge for yourself at <uri>www.nps.gov/aboutus/foia/foia-frd.htm</uri> (scroll halfway down the page to inaugural photos).</p>
<p>Staged events also call the veracity of images into question. Let&#x2019;s say we are watching the news and we see a political candidate, shirtsleeves rolled up, wearing a hardhat, while touring a factory. The image emphasizes the candidate&#x2019;s &#x201C;plain folks&#x201D; appeal. He or she identifies with ordinary workers. But would the candidate have rolled up his or her sleeves, donned a hardhat, and toured the factory in the absence of any camera crews? The cameras are recording an event that might not take place in their absence.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ve all seen news footage of angry citizens in foreign lands burning the American flag to protest U.S. foreign policies. It seems fair to ask, however, whether the cameras are there because the protesters are burning the flag or the protesters are burning the flag because the cameras are there. A critical viewer should, therefore, question the indexicality of visual records of events. Media events can be staged. Hey, some people think the moon landing was faked! We don&#x2019;t, but the presence of cameras and film crews can alter people&#x2019;s behavior. Photographs and videotapes can be digitally altered to create the appearance that events occurred when, in fact, they did not, or did not occur in the way they are pictured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14_4_3">
<title>Syntactic Indeterminacy: Don&#x2019;t Look for Logic in Images</title>
<p>A third way in which images persuade is through <italic>syntactic indeterminacy.</italic> This simply means that, unlike words, pictures cannot convey precise relationships between things. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_54">Messaris (1997)</xref> thus noted, &#x201C;what visual syntax lacks, especially in comparison to <target target-type="page" id="page_341">341</target>verbal language, is a set of explicit devices for indicating causality, analogy, or any other relationships other than those of space or time&#x201D; (pp. xvii&#x2013;xviii). The problem is that images lack logical operators&#x2014;that is, they can&#x2019;t explicitly state cause&#x2013;effect, if&#x2013;then, either&#x2013;or relationships, or other logical connections between people, objects, and events. As an example, a picture can show what a person&#x2019;s abdominal muscles looked like before using the new &#x201C;Monster Ab-Cruncher.&#x201D; Another picture can show what the person&#x2019;s abdominal muscles look like afterward. However, pictures themselves can&#x2019;t specify a cause&#x2013;effect relationship.</p>
<p>The fact that images can&#x2019;t convey logical relationships, such as &#x201C;A causes B,&#x201D; &#x201C;A is analogous to B,&#x201D; or &#x201C;either A or B will happen,&#x201D; is both a blessing and a curse. The blessing is that pictures can be used to equate one thing with another, via association. Images can be juxtaposed to imply an association without actually saying so. This can work to a persuader&#x2019;s advantage. For example, researchers found that a picture of 14 sugar cubes stacked next to a can of Coke was more effective at reducing intentions to consume sugary soft drinks than a text-only label stating that the same Coke can contained 35 grams of sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_1">Adams, Hart, Gilmer, &#x0026; Lloyd-Richardson, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>A persuader can also foster subtle associations through images without making the associations explicit in words. For example, an advertiser can equate a product with being cool, or sexy, or conferring social status simply by pairing the product with cool, sexy, or classy images.</p>
<p>The curse is that images can never suggest the precise nature of relationships, so it is up to the observer to guess what the relationship is. A car commercial might depict a happy family carrying kayaks from their hybrid SUV to a river. Rather than make the consumer want a hybrid SUV, as the advertiser intends, the sequence of images may make the consumer want to go camping, or buy a kayak, or spend more time with the family instead. This is not a serious drawback, however, for two reasons. First, advertisers have decades of practice at manipulating lighting, camera angle, color, and other aspects of images to achieve the results they want. Second, advertisers use words when they want to make a point explicitly and pictures when they want to make a point implicitly. Thus, they enjoy the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Now that you have a better understanding of how images persuade, we can turn our attention to some of the intriguing and important ways visual stimuli affect us. We begin by examining art as a visual form of influence.</p>

<sec id="sec14_5">
<title>The Art of Persuasion includes Art as Persuasion</title>
<p>The use of art to further political and religious ends dates to ancient civilizations. Greek friezes and frescoes taught citizens moral lessons involving Greek gods and Greek mythology. In the Middle Ages, organized religions sponsored art to further religious ends. The Catholic Church commissioned thousands of works of art to promote Catholicism. As only one example, Michelangelo&#x2019;s painting of the finger of God reaching out to man that adorns the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel endorses a biblical view of creation.</p>
<sec id="sec14_5_1">
<title>The Paintbrush Is Mightier than the Sword</title>
<p>Governments, especially totalitarian governments, have used art as a form of political propaganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_17">Clark, 1997</xref>). Under Stalin, the Soviet Union declared all art to be <target target-type="page" id="page_342">342</target>subservient to the interests of the state. &#x201C;Socialist Realism&#x201D; became the officially recognized standard for art, and its purpose was to advance the political and social ideals of communism. All art projects were commissioned by the government. Not surprisingly, paintings and posters from this era featured members of the proletariat working side by side in factories and on farms. Such iconic representations idealized communism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_17">Clark (1997)</xref> explains how such politicized art modeled behavior for the masses:

<p>in paintings, novels, and films, Socialist Realism created a parallel world peopled by heroes and heroines who personified political ideals. As tireless labourers, courageous Red Army soldiers, diligent schoolchildren, or dedicated Party activists, they demonstrated exemplary behaviour and the attitudes of perfect citizens.</p>

<p>Similarly, under Mao, China produced a great deal of art aimed at promoting Communist ideology. When the Communists assumed power in 1949, posters and murals contributed to the deification of Chairman Mao. Graphic arts also were used to mobilize and indoctrinate the people during the Cultural Revolution. Posters <target target-type="page" id="page_343">343</target>showed smiling, cherubic children, peasants, and soldiers all harvesting bumper crops together&#x2014;a tribute to the agricultural achievements of the revolution.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Western world, art was not only sponsored by governments but was directed against governments as well. Eug&#x00E8;ne Delacroix&#x2019;s well-known painting <italic>Liberty Leading the People</italic> (1830) now hangs in the Mus&#x00E9;e du Louvre in Paris. The painting shows a mythical lady liberty, rifle in one hand and French flag in the other, leading French citizens in a charge during the French Revolution. Through its iconicity, the painting both endorses and romanticizes the revolution. Diego Rivera&#x2019;s <italic>History of Mexico</italic> (1929&#x2013;1935), a large mural painted on the walls of the National Palace in Mexico City, depicts the domination of Mexico&#x2019;s peasants first by Spanish conquistadors, then the Catholic Church, then the Mexican army, and finally by wealthy landowners. The painting reveals the struggle of the downtrodden against oppression, a struggle that culminated in the Mexican Revolution. These are but two examples of socially and politically inspired art.</p>

<title>Art and Social Change: I Must Protest</title>
<p>As we noted in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter1">Chapter 1</xref>, not all art is created for art&#x2019;s sake. Art serves more than an aesthetic or decorative function. Contemporary artists have strong opinions on political and social issues, and they express them in and through their work. Bertolt Brecht&#x2019;s oft-cited quip that &#x201C;art is not a mirror to reflect reality, but a hammer with which to shape it&#x201D; (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_52">McLaren &#x0026; Leonard, 1993</xref>, p. 80) sums up this view.</p>
<p>A contemporary manifestation of this perspective can be found in protest art or the art of social activism. Such art critiques society and promotes social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_38">Hobbs &#x0026; Woodard, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_46">Lippard, 1984</xref>). This activity typically occurs in public spaces. For example, a bronze sculpture, called <italic>Fearless Girl</italic>, was unveiled in a highly public space near Wall Street in 2017 in honor of International Women&#x2019;s Day. The girl stands with her hands on her hips, head held high, facing down a sculpture of a charging bull that was already in place. The statue immediately sparked a public debate. Admirers said <italic>Fearless Girl</italic> sent a powerful message about the need for gender diversity in corporate America. Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of New York declared, &#x201C;this statue has touched hearts across the world with its symbolism of the resiliency of women&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_58">O&#x2019;Connor, 2017</xref>, para. 3).</p>
<p>Critics, however, complained that the sculpture represented faux feminism, since it was commissioned by a Wall Street investment firm promoting a gender diverse fund called SHE. Arturo Di Modica, the sculptor who created the charging bull, complained that his sculpture had been hijacked. He demanded that <italic>Fearless Girl</italic> be relocated. The juxtapositioning of one icon opposite another suggested an adversarial relationship between the girl and the bull. Mayor de Blasio countered with the tweet shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14_3">Figure 14.3</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig14_3" position="float">

<graphic orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fig14_3.jpg"/>
</fig>
<p><italic>Fearless Girl</italic> achieved her purpose by provoking a public debate about gender representation in the boardroom. Activist artists seek to engage the public in their art and increase the public&#x2019;s social consciousness. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_25">Felshin (1995)</xref> notes, such artists are &#x201C;attempting at the very least to &#x2018;change the conversation&#x2019; to empower individuals and communities, and ultimately to stimulate social change&#x201D; (p. 26). For example, a popular graffiti artist, known as Banksy, stencils images onto walls and buildings in public places at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_62">Pryor, 2007</xref>). One of his works depicts Dorothy and Toto, from the <italic>Wizard of Oz</italic>. Her basket is being searched by an officer in riot gear wearing <target target-type="page" id="page_344">344</target>latex gloves. The image suggests that society&#x2019;s paranoia over security has gone too far. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_22">Duncombe (2016)</xref> identifies a number of goals and functions of activist art, including altering perceptions, building community, causing disruption, fostering dialogue, promoting political change, and transforming the environment. We focus on two such functions here, involving increased awareness.</p>
<sec id="sec14_5_2_1">
<title>Awareness Through Interpretation</title>
<p>How do activist artists go about persuading? One method is by increasing <italic>awareness through interpretation</italic>. Activist art might consist of an exhibit that is odd, disturbing, or peculiar. The artist seeks to pique the viewer&#x2019;s curiosity and pull him or her in. In the process of trying to understand the work, the viewer&#x2019;s awareness is increased. Interpretation requires active thinking or central processing, which, as we learned earlier, is more likely to trigger lasting attitude change.</p>
<p>For instance, Suzanne Lacy re-created an earlier work, called <italic>Three Weeks in May</italic>, again in 2012, this time called <italic>Three Weeks in January</italic> (<uri>www.suzannelacy.com/three-weeks-in-january/</uri>). As part of a collaboration with SafeLA.org and other groups, she sought to increase public awareness of sexual assault. On a huge map of Los Angeles, she stenciled the word &#x201C;rape,&#x201D; in red block letters, at the locations where rapes had been reported, from January 12 to February 1, 2012. Before long, the map was peppered with red stencils. The exhibit provided a graphic revelation of the scope and severity of the problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14_5_2_2">
<title>Awareness Through Participation</title>
<p>Yet another approach is to increase <italic>awareness through participation</italic>. Such art is collaborative or interactive. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_25">Felshin (1995)</xref> comments, &#x201C;participation is a catalyst for social change&#x201D; (p. 12). By way of example, Wafaa Bilal created an interactive installation, called <italic>Domestic Tension</italic>, in a Chicago art gallery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_11">Bilal &#x0026; Lydersen, 2008</xref>). Bilal, an Iraqi artist living in political asylum in the United States, occupied a Plexiglas room for one month. During this time, people went online and shot at him using a robotically controlled paintball gun. This went on 24 hours a day. They shot him in the head when he fell asleep and in the groin when he stood up. More than 60,000 shots were fired at him by strangers from more than 120 countries. Over time, some sympathetic viewers formed a &#x201C;human shield&#x201D; by trying to aim the <target target-type="page" id="page_345">345</target>gun away from Bilal. Others hacked in to the system to make the gun fire more rapidly. By the project&#x2019;s end, the room was drenched in paint and Bilal was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>So what did viewers&#x2019; participation mean? Clearly, many people had no qualms about shooting a person online. Others were confronted with their own morality in choosing to shoot, or not to shoot, another human being. The project laid bare cultural, ethnic, and religious tensions between Westerners and Middle Easterners. By allowing virtual strangers to shoot him, Bilal focused attention on how desensitized modern societies are to violence. Killing has become robotic, clinical, and&#x2014;as in his project&#x2014;carried out from afar. When innocent civilians are killed by drone missiles, they are simply labeled &#x201C;collateral damage.&#x201D; People living comfortably in stable societies are blithely unaware of the suffering of people in conflict zones.</p>
<p>Another example of collaborative art is the AIDS Memorial Quilt, founded by Cleve Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_41">Jones &#x0026; Dawson, 2000</xref>). The quilt, also known as the NAMES Project, is a folk-art project commemorating those who died of AIDS. It comprises thousands of 3 ft. &#x00D7; 6ft. panels, each dedicated to the memory of a specific person. The quilt was first displayed on the Washington Mall in 1987, and again in 1992 and 1996. It became the largest community art project in the world. Portions of the quilt are now part of traveling displays that are shown throughout the world. The panels are preserved in an archive (<uri>www.aidsquilt.org/about/the-aids-memorial-quilt</uri>).</p>
<p>The AIDS Memorial Quilt persuades on multiple levels. We often hear statistics about AIDS, but the quilt puts a human face on these numbers. Every panel is a handmade testimonial to a specific individual&#x2019;s life. When people see the quilt they understand, in concrete rather than abstract terms, the toll taken by the disease. The very choice of making a quilt was a persuasive one. Cleve Jones was attracted to the idea of quilting because it is a traditional American folk art. Quilts conjure up images of home and family. AIDS, however, was thought of as a promiscuous gay male disease. The quilt served as a means of countering that image. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_41">Jones and Dawson (2000)</xref> note:
<disp-quote>
<p>There was hope we could beat the disease by using the quilt as a symbol of solidarity, of family and community; there was hope that we could make a movement that would welcome people&#x2014;men and women, gay and straight, of every age, race, faith, and background.</p>
<attrib>(p. 108)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The AIDS Memorial Quilt increased the public&#x2019;s awareness of the disease. It also brought people together. Loved ones who didn&#x2019;t know how to grieve found an outlet in creating a panel. This was truly participatory art. Students who have seen the quilt reported that the experience reduced their homophobia and increased their desire to practice safe sex. This fact alone demonstrates the quilt&#x2019;s persuasiveness as a work of art.</p>
<p>Activist art is often controversial. Indeed, that is its purpose. It is precisely because art has the capacity to arouse people&#x2019;s interest, attention, and ire that it is influential. A primary goal of activist artists is to raise the public&#x2019;s consciousness on a variety of social and political issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_25">Felshin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_38">Hobbs &#x0026; Woodard, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_46">Lippard, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_76">Von Blum, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_77">1994</xref>). Art can challenge the existing social order. It can make <target target-type="page" id="page_346">346</target>people angry. It can offend. At the same time it can heighten people&#x2019;s awareness. It can make people question their assumptions. It can change the way they see things. It can make them reconsider long-held beliefs. In doing so, art persuades.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_347">347</target>Cinematic Persuasion: Sex, Drugs, and Popcorn</title>
<p>Upon receiving an award from the American Museum of the Moving Image, Steven Spielberg remarked that cinema &#x201C;is the most powerful weapon in the world&#x201D; (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_27">Fuller, 1995</xref>, p. 190). There are several factors at work that lend films their power to persuade.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14_1"><sup>1</sup></xref> First, there is the potential for mass suggestion. Millions of people are exposed to movies in the United States and abroad. In fact, movies are one of America&#x2019;s leading exports. Thus, movies reach vast audiences. Second, movies are told in a <italic>narrative</italic> form&#x2014;that is, as stories. Stories possess an aura of believability not found in other mediums for communication. When we watch a movie, we engage in a &#x201C;willing suspension of disbelief.&#x201D; In order to follow the story, we must lose ourselves in the imaginary world of the film. In so doing, we give up some of our ability to think and reason. Third, the power of films to persuade is aided by the fact that when people sit down in a theater they don&#x2019;t expect to be persuaded, they expect to be entertained. Therefore, they tend to let down their guards and become more open to suggestion. We believe this is one of the reasons that <italic>product placement</italic>&#x2014;the practice of inserting brand-name items into movie scenes&#x2014;is so prevalent. Lastly, films are carefully crafted works. Considerable planning and attention to detail go <target target-type="page" id="page_348">348</target>into the making of a film. Something as simple as a close-up or a swell in the music can enhance the intensity of emotion on the big screen. Thus, motion pictures represent finely crafted messages. Few real-world persuaders, such as salespeople, attorneys, or politicians, have the luxury of lavishing so much time and attention on their persuasive messages.</p>

<sec id="sec14_6_1">
<title>Acting Out: How Movies Persuade</title>
<p>Movies persuade in multiple ways and on multiple levels. Some of the influential features are unique to particular genres of film. Docudramas, such as <italic>JFK</italic> or <italic>Titanic</italic>, for instance, may convince viewers that a subjective interpretation of events is an objective recounting of the facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_70">Simpson, 2008</xref>). Dramas and romantic comedies may model traditional or nontraditional gender roles. Violent movies, such as <italic>Pulp Fiction</italic>, <italic>Kill Bill</italic>, and <italic>Natural Born Killers</italic>, may desensitize people to violent or aggressive behavior. We examine some of the most important ways that films persuade here.</p>
<sec id="sec14_6_1_1">
<title>Exporting Values Abroad</title>
<p>The first of the ways in which films persuade is that American movies export <italic>Western values</italic>. As one commentator noted, &#x201C;Hollywood films are America&#x2019;s biggest cultural export, consumed by billions around the globe&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_37">Hey, 2001</xref>, p. 4). People in remote areas of the world know who Sylvester Stallone is, based on the film character <italic>Rocky.</italic> They know who Julia Roberts is from her role in <italic>Pretty Woman.</italic> American films embody Western values. Rocky was the blue-collar guy who made his dream come true. Julia Roberts was the prostitute with a heart of gold.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about the values promoted by American movies. Some view the movie industry as a form of cultural imperialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_19">Crane, 2014</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_73">Su (2016)</xref> observes, &#x201C;American popular culture in general, and Hollywood films in particular, explicitly and actively advocate American values and the American way of life, thereby threatening other national and local cultures&#x201D; (p. 46). Foreign audiences often resent the infusion of Western values such as promiscuity, violence, and drug use into their own culture (many in the United States aren&#x2019;t too thrilled with these values either). Others resent the emphasis on materialism and conspicuous consumption. At the same time, movies can advance positive values such as freedom, human rights, and equality. The point is that movies tacitly endorse Western values that may or may not be shared by people in other cultures.</p>
<p>On the positive side, movies can promote prosocial values. Movies often champion the underdog. In <italic>Hunger Games</italic>, <italic>Rudy</italic>, and <italic>Slumdog Millionaire</italic>, the underdog perseveres and, ultimately, wins. Other films, such as <italic>Finding Nemo</italic>, <italic>My Left Foot</italic>, and <italic>Theory of Everything</italic> feature those with disabilities in a favorable light. <italic>Forrest Gump</italic> demonstrated that values such as honesty and compassion can triumph over mental and physical limitations. Fate threw hardships in his way, but Forrest showed us that it is how we deal with adversity that determines who we are. More recently, animated Disney movies, such as <italic>Brave, Mulan,</italic> and <italic>Frozen</italic> have abandoned the &#x201C;damsel in distress&#x201D; refrain in favor of assertive, independent roles for female protagonists. Films like <italic>Akeelah and the Bee</italic>, <italic>Hidden Figures</italic>, and <italic>The Princess and the Frog</italic> offer positive, uplifting roles for African American females.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14_6_1_2">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_349">349</target>Promoting Popular Culture</title>
<p>A second way in which movies persuade is by <italic>promoting popular culture</italic> both at home and abroad. Fashions, hairstyles, habits, lifestyles, and slang terminology are often emulated by moviegoers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_15">Chansanchai, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_75">Unterberger, 2001</xref>). If you are old enough, or into retro fashion, you may recall the popularity of white, three-piece suits following the release of the disco film <italic>Saturday Night Fever</italic>, starring John Travolta. <italic>Donnie Darko</italic> and <italic>The Crow</italic> inspired &#x201C;Goth&#x201D; culture. Katniss Everdeen&#x2019;s braided hair in <italic>Hunger Games</italic> popularized the side plait. Edward Cullen&#x2019;s upswept hair in <italic>Twilight</italic> made him a heartthrob among brooding, moody teens. After seeing Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Lautner, or Chris Hemsworth on the big screen, many guys hit the gym to work on their abs and pecs. As a function of their iconicity, movies have a way of idealizing and romanticizing trends and lifestyles. Cinema, then, is a major vehicle for the dissemination of fads, fashions, and trends.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14_6_1_3">
<title>Modeling Behavior: Social Proof</title>
<p>A third way in which movies persuade is by <italic>modeling behaviors</italic>. People may gauge what constitutes appropriate behavior in social situations by taking a movie character&#x2019;s lead. Albert Bandura&#x2019;s <italic>social cognitive theory</italic> maintains that adolescents observe behaviors that are modeled in the media and then imitate those behaviors in real life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_5">Bandura, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_6">1989</xref>). For example, young teens who watch movies about dating and relationships, such as <italic>Mean Girls</italic>, <italic>American Pie</italic>, and <italic>Superbad</italic>, may take their cue about how to deal with love and relationships based on behaviors they see in movies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_8">Behm-Morawitz &#x0026; Mastro, 2008</xref>). At a subconscious level, people may enact scripts they&#x2019;ve learned from movies as well.</p>
<p>Characters in movies also model risky, unsafe, or violent behaviors. This can have the effect of legitimizing such behaviors. Movie characters rarely wear seat belts. They often engage in unprotected sex. They frequently smoke, use drugs, get drunk, and drive recklessly. Oh, and they kill lots of people. Regardless of whether these activities are intentional, their prevalence in movies tends to glamorize them. The actions of the characters in movies may be seen as placing a stamp of approval on those behaviors. For example, there is strong evidence that adolescents who see a lot of smoking on the big screen are more likely to light up. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_36">Heatherton and Sargent (2009)</xref> reported that teens with high exposure to smoking in movies were three times more likely to smoke than those with low exposure. The same applies to unprotected sex. More than 80 percent of PG and PG-13 rated movies include some sexual content. Exposure to sexual content increases the likelihood of unprotected sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_59">O&#x2019;Hara, Gibbons, Gerrard, Li, &#x0026; Sargent, 2012</xref>). Yet 98 percent of movies with sex scenes make no mention of safe sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_31">Gunasekera, Chapman, &#x0026; Campbell, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14_6_1_4">
<title>Cultivation Theory: It&#x2019;s a Mean, Scary World</title>
<p>A fourth way in which movies persuade is by fostering beliefs about a world fraught with danger. Other studies have examined the effects of a steady diet of violence on TV. Would it surprise you to learn that gun violence in the top PG-13 rated movies was greater than in the top R-rated films? Such is the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_14">Cha, 2017</xref>). <italic>Cultivation theory</italic> maintains that the more violence people watch on TV, the more likely they are to develop an exaggerated belief in a <italic>mean, scary world</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_28">Gerbner, Gross, Morgan, &#x0026; Signorielli, 2002</xref>). In addition to developing a jaded view of the world, viewing <target target-type="page" id="page_350">350</target>violence tends to increase aggression and antisocial behavior in people. &#x201C;Fifty years of research on the effects of TV violence,&#x201D; notes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_57">John Murray (2008)</xref>, &#x201C;leads to the inescapable conclusion that viewing media violence is related to increases in aggressive attitudes, values, and behaviors&#x201D; (p. 1212). With respect to cinema&#x2019;s influence on behavior, Oliver Stone, who directed <italic>Natural Born Killers</italic>, commented, &#x201C;Film is a powerful medium. Film is a drug. It goes into your eye. It goes into your brain. It stimulates, and that&#x2019;s a dangerous thing&#x201D; (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_45">Leiby, 1995</xref>, p. G1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14_6_1_5">
<title>Viewer Identification</title>
<p>A fifth way in which movies persuade is by promoting viewer identification. Moviegoers may idolize a particular actor or actress or a specific character played by that actor or actress. Perhaps you know a few Kristen Stewart or Johnny Depp &#x201C;wannabes.&#x201D; Young adults may discover &#x201C;possible selves&#x201D; from seeing movies or may derive a sense of validation from a character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_30">Greenwood &#x0026; Long, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Sometimes the story of the character overlaps with the viewer&#x2019;s own experience, causing the viewer to identify with the character in the film. If you&#x2019;ve ever felt like an outcast, a nerd, the underdog, or misunderstood, you might identify with movies such as <italic>Napoleon Dynamite</italic>, <italic>Ghost World</italic>, <italic>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</italic>, <italic>Happy Times</italic>, or <italic>Pretty in Pink</italic>. In this way, movies establish a common bond with viewers.</p>
<p>Viewer identification can take place even if a viewer&#x2019;s experience doesn&#x2019;t directly overlap with that of a character in a movie. None of us have met an extraterrestrial (okay, <italic>most</italic> of us haven&#x2019;t), but we can still identify with a movie such as <italic>E.T.</italic>, because all of us have had to say goodbye to someone we love. None of us are green ogres, but we can identify with Shrek because we&#x2019;ve all felt like outsiders from time to time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14_6_1_6">
<title>Perpetuating Stereotypes</title>
<p>A final way in which cinema shapes public perceptions is by fostering and perpetuating stereotypes. Hollywood frequently typecasts minorities, women, overweight people, the elderly, and other groups into limited roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_9">Benshoff &#x0026; Griffin, 2009</xref>). This may create the impression that these are the only roles these groups are capable of performing. Although the number of parts for minorities has increased, the roles often involve the same predictable stereotypes. Middle Easterners, for example, are frequently cast as terrorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_68">Shaheen, 2009</xref>). When they aren&#x2019;t terrorists, they are often playboys or cab drivers. Hispanics are often depicted as drug dealers or gang-bangers. While the situation has improved, many roles for Hispanics remain tied to cultural stereotypes. Asians also tend to occupy stereotypic roles in films. If Hollywood is to be believed, every Asian is skilled in martial arts. They are often undersexed and romantically awkward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_81">Whitty, 2001</xref>). As with other minorities, things are changing, but slowly.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, African Americans have been historically typecast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_24">Entman &#x0026; Rojecki, 2001</xref>). African American males fit the mold of athlete, drug dealer, or musician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_79">Waxman, 2000</xref>). African American women tend to be relegated to stereotypic roles such as beautiful wife, beautiful girlfriend, or beautiful prostitute. African Americans also are typecast as the funny sidekick in &#x201C;buddy&#x201D; movies. Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, Chris Rock, and Chris Tucker have all played such parts. These, too, are narrowly defined roles. The situation has improved. Halle Berry, Jamie Foxx, Denzel Washington, and Forest Whitaker have all won Oscars for best <target target-type="page" id="page_351">351</target>actress or actor. Their success may convince filmmakers and the movie-going public that African Americans can be taken seriously on screen. In 2016, the dearth of African American Oscar nominees sparked a &#x0023;OscarsSoWhite movement, with numerous black stars boycotting the Academy Awards ceremony.</p>
<p>When it comes to stereotypic roles, women fare no better. With few exceptions women must be thin and beautiful to land starring roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_9">Benshoff &#x0026; Griffin, 2009</xref>). In action-adventure movies, women are depicted as powerful and objects of desire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_50">McClearen, 2015</xref>). Women also tend to be confined to traditional roles: mother, wife, mistress, girlfriend. This isn&#x2019;t particularly surprising, given that fewer than 10 percent of screenplays are written by women, and fewer than 6 percent of movies are directed by women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_47">Maher, 2009</xref>). Admittedly, there are some women in nontraditional roles. Nevertheless, roles for women, especially older women, remain limited.</p>
<p>If there is a silver lining, it is that younger moviegoers tend to be more tolerant, if not completely color-blind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_80">Welkos, 2001</xref>). This is evidenced by the box-office success of recent multiethnic, multicultural movies, such as <italic>Joy Luck Club</italic>, <italic>Moana</italic>, <italic>Slum Dog Millionaire</italic>, <italic>the Big Sick</italic>, and <italic>The Help</italic>. Because youth culture includes more African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans, filmmakers are producing more multiethnic movies to meet the demands of a new generation of viewers.</p>

<title>Images in Advertising: And Now A Word from Our Sponsors</title>
<p>&#x201C;Advertising,&#x201D; write <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_82">Woodward and Denton (1999)</xref>, &#x201C;is undoubtedly the most pervasive form of persuasion in our society&#x201D; (p. 286). When we think of pure cases of persuasion, advertising immediately comes to mind. Over &#x0024;200 billion per year is spent on advertising in the United States, with an increasing share going to digital advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_71">Statista, 2017</xref>). Various estimates suggest that the average person is exposed to more than 3,000 advertising messages per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_23">Dupont, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_69">Simons, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_82">Woodward &#x0026; Denton, 1999</xref>). Some estimates are even higher. One estimate places daily media exposure at 15.5 hours per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_78">Walsh-Childers, 2017</xref>). If all the money spent on advertising were divvied up, it would work out to about &#x0024;800 per person in the United States and &#x0024;40 per person in all other countries combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_10">Berger, 2011</xref>). Most of us are &#x201C;armchair&#x201D; experts in advertising, having watched so many commercials during our lives. Indeed, the average American spends about one hour per day watching television commercials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_65">Salter, 2009</xref>). That works out to more than two years of commercial viewing over an average lifespan.</p>
<p>Advertisements, whether on television, in a magazine, online, or some other medium, feature images. The visual components of such ads are often key to their effectiveness. Visually oriented ads work their magic in a variety of ways. We don&#x2019;t have enough space to examine all the ways here, so we focus on four of the most important ones.</p>
<sec id="sec14_7_1">
<title>Visual Extravaganzas: Now You&#x2019;ve Got My Attention</title>
<p>One challenge that advertisers face in trying to convince consumers to buy their products is <italic>media clutter.</italic> There are so many ads competing for consumers&#x2019; attention <target target-type="page" id="page_352">352</target>that it is difficult for a message to stand out in the crowd. Commercials must grab and hold viewers&#x2019; attention. Thanks to CGI, it is now possible for advertisers to create and manipulate images in ways previously not possible. A plain-vanilla commercial simply won&#x2019;t hold up to an eye-popping extravaganza, especially when viewers have low involvement with the topic or issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14_7_2">
<title>Anti-Ads: You Can&#x2019;t Fool Me</title>
<p>Another challenge facing advertisers is that consumers are increasingly cynical about advertising. They don&#x2019;t trust Madison Avenue. But that skepticism is the very premise on which <italic>anti-ads</italic> are based. Anti-advertising, or &#x201C;subvertising&#x201D; as it is sometimes called, caters to consumers who distrust the media. Anti-ads mock advertising itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_4">Axelton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_7">Beato, 1999</xref>). They denounce traditional advertising to gain acceptance by consumers.</p>
<p>Many anti-ads are spoofs on commercial advertising (see <uri>www.adbusters.org</uri>). Others are designed to sell actual products and services. Geico spoofed insurance comparison ads by conducting a mock insurance &#x201C;taste test.&#x201D; Consumers who sampled a glass of Geico said &#x201C;mmm, yum,&#x201D; while consumers who taste-tested a competing brand of auto insurance said &#x201C;ugh, yuck!&#x201D;</p>
<p>An antismoking commercial also offers an example of an anti-ad. The spot shows two cowboys in a downtown setting, one playing guitar and the other singing. The singing cowboy, however, is singing through a hand-held device pressed against his neck (an electro larynx). He&#x2019;s had a laryngectomy. He sings, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t always die from tobacco, sometimes you just lose a lung. Oh, you don&#x2019;t always die from tobacco, sometimes they just snip out your tongue.&#x201D; This ad mocks the rugged cowboy mystique associated with Marlboro cigarettes.</p>
<p>In essence, anti-ads are telling viewers, &#x201C;Hey, you&#x2019;re on to us. You&#x2019;re too smart to be fooled.&#x201D; But of course, that strategy is itself a ploy designed to appeal to jaded consumers. Such an approach creates the perception that the advertiser respects the viewer&#x2019;s intelligence. Advertisers are constantly finding ways to reinvent themselves. As consumers have grown more skeptical, advertisers have found ways to adapt to, and capitalize on, their skepticism. Anti-ads or subvertising thus mark another evolutionary phase in advertising.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14_7_3">
<title>Image-Oriented Advertising: Materialism as Happiness</title>
<p>In addition to using vivid imagery and anti-advertising, advertisers also seek to create positive associations between their brands and idealized images or lifestyles. This approach is known as <italic>image-oriented</italic> or <italic>image-based advertising</italic> and it is the bread and butter of modern advertising campaigns. Image-oriented ads rely on the syntactic indeterminacy of images. Remember, images don&#x2019;t contain logical operators, so they can&#x2019;t make clear-cut claims. That turns out to be a plus, however, because by pairing a product with a favorable image, an advertiser can equate the two without actually saying so in words. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_54">Messaris (1997)</xref> underscored this feature, stating that &#x201C;this ability to imply something in pictures while avoiding the consequences of saying it in words has been considered an advantage of visual advertising since the first days of its development as a mass medium&#x201D; (p. xix).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_353">353</target>Let&#x2019;s consider some examples of this in action. Oil companies don&#x2019;t want you to think about tar-covered birds on an oil-stained beach when you envision petroleum products. They want you to associate oil companies with pro-environmental attitudes. Hence, Chevron&#x2019;s &#x201C;People do&#x201D; advertising campaign, which portrays Chevron as a guardian of endangered species.</p>
<p>Image-oriented ads portray a brand as the embodiment of an idealized lifestyle. Equating the brand with an idealized lifestyle creates identification with that brand. When we buy that brand we are buying into that lifestyle. Some brands are <italic>luxury brands</italic>, prestigious, yet within reach of many consumers (Ralph Lauren, Mercedes). Some are <italic>aspirational brands</italic>; few people can afford them, but they hope to own them one day (Armani, Rolls Royce). Still others are <italic>authentic or genuine brands</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_29">Gilmore &#x0026; Pine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_64">Rosica, 2007</xref>). These brands are unpretentious. In a marketplace filled with fake, phony products, consumers value what seems real. A smaller brand with a story to tell may be more desirable than a mass-produced commodity. Organic foods, handmade goods, and artisanal beers fall into this category. With a little practice, you should be able to watch a TV commercial or view a magazine ad and decipher the favorable image or association the advertiser is trying to manufacture. Some of the most common associations are as follows:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Social status and elitism:</italic> Ads for luxury cars and expensive watches often associate owning these products with prestige and success. Ads for expensive wines, luggage, jewelry, and other upscale goods often imply that the products are symbols of taste and refinement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Sex or romance:</italic> Ads for perfume, lingerie, and hair-care products often equate the products with sexiness, allure, and romance. The association established by many perfume ads is that if you wear that fragrance you&#x2019;ll be more sexy, or other sexy people will be attracted to you.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Cause-related:</italic> Some brands have a cause to promote. Consumers aren&#x2019;t just buying a product or service, they are also helping to feed starving children, save rainforests, or protect endangered species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_2">Adkins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_61">Pringle &#x0026; Thompson, 1999</xref>). TOMS shoes and (Product) Red exemplify this approach. Ben &#x0026; Jerry&#x2019;s promotes social change as well by donating a percentage of their profits to social causes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Power, speed, and strength:</italic> Ads for tools, trucks, SUVs, computers, and nutritional supplements often equate buying a product with conferring power on the user. Dodge trucks are &#x201C;Ram tough.&#x201D; Chevy trucks are built &#x201C;Like a rock.&#x201D; You, too, can have rock-hard abs or buns of steel. If you&#x2019;ve got the newest, fastest computer, you are a &#x201C;power user.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Youth culture:</italic> A number of products are marketed by associating products with youth culture, rebelliousness, and an alternative lifestyle. Soft drinks, clothing, fast food, skateboards, small electronics, makeup, and many other goods and services appeal to what is hip, trendy, or cool. These commercials are often shot with handheld cameras and employ rapid editing techniques to simulate the look of &#x201C;reality TV.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Safety, security:</italic> Ads for banking, insurance, and retirement accounts try to foster images of being safe and secure. Consumers want peace of mind and a sense of stability when it comes to their finances and retirement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><target target-type="page" id="page_354">354</target><italic>Sense of place, belonging:</italic> Ads for foods, restaurants, furniture, and other household goods often strive to create a sense of hominess. The advertisers want you to get a warm, comfortable, familiar feeling when you think of their products.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>These are only some of the important values and lifestyles to which advertisers attempt to link their brands. When you watch a commercial or read a print ad, you should examine the associations the advertiser is trying to establish. For decades, cigarette ads fostered the association that smoking was cool. More recently, antismoking ads have associated smoking with being uncool. Both approaches rely on the underlying assumption that &#x201C;being cool&#x201D; is what really counts in life. Is it? When evaluating a commercial or print ad, ask yourself three important questions:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What image or lifestyle is being associated with the product?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is that image or lifestyle truly desirable? Is that the image I&#x2019;m really seeking or the lifestyle to which I truly aspire?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Would buying the product actually grant me the image or lifestyle equated with the product? If so, how?</p></list-item>

<title>Shock Ads: Edgy Images as Persuasion</title>
<p>Some pro-life videos feature grisly images of late-term abortions in which the fetus has been dismembered prior to extraction. The images are intended to be repulsive. Is it acceptable to use gory images to persuade? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_42">Kelland and Macleod (2015)</xref> note that anti-abortionists view such gruesome images as revealing the truth about the practice of abortion. Only by showing such images, anti-abortionists argue, can the immorality of the practice be revealed. Images of abortion, pro-life proponents claim, are analogous to images of the Holocaust. They must be seen to be believed.</p>
<p>In contrast, pro-choice proponents argue that grisly photos are misleading, because a small percentage of abortions are late-term. Shocking photos, pro-choice advocates maintain, ignore the circumstances of a woman who opted for a late-term abortion, such as rape, incest, severe birth defects, or a threat to the woman&#x2019;s life. The contested nature of pro-life imagery illustrates the tension between images that appeal to the head or the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_42">Kelland &#x0026; Macleod, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Images also figure heavily into the form of advertising known as <italic>shock ads.</italic> Shock ads, or &#x201C;shockvertising&#x201D; as it has also been called, push the boundaries of taste and propriety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_44">Lazar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_49">McCarthy, 2000</xref>). The goal is to sell products by being edgy. Some shock ads are vulgar, some erotic, some humorous, and others nauseating. Some adopt an &#x201C;in your face&#x201D; style of advertising.</p>
<p>The Montana Meth Project ran a series of public service announcements graphically depicting the consequences of meth use. One depicted a boyfriend who &#x201C;pimped out&#x201D; his girlfriend to support their meth habit (<uri>www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-iEA6-I1xU</uri>). A billboard showed a young woman with a thousand-yard stare and the caption &#x201C;15 bucks for sex isn&#x2019;t normal, but on meth it is.&#x201D; The effectiveness of the MMP has been questioned, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_3">Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_48">Marsh, Copes, &#x0026; Linnemann, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Even shock ads can go too far. In the United Kingdom, hundreds of readers complained when they found a full-page ad showing a newborn infant with a <target target-type="page" id="page_355">355</target>cockroach in its mouth. The ad was sponsored by Barnardo&#x2019;s, a children&#x2019;s charity group, and was designed to draw attention to the plight of children living in poverty. The ad was banned by Britain&#x2019;s Advertising Standards Authority.</p>
<p>Given their widespread use, do shock ads really work? A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_20">Dahl, Frankenberger, and Manchanda (2003)</xref> suggests they do. These researchers concluded that &#x201C;shocking content in an advertisement significantly increases attention, benefits memory, and positively influences behavior&#x201D; (p. 1). Other studies also support the effectiveness of shock ads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_66">Scudder &#x0026; Mill, 2009</xref>). But shock ads must walk a fine line. If they aren&#x2019;t shocking enough, they won&#x2019;t provoke the public dialogue and publicity they seek. If they are overly shocking, they may prompt a consumer rebellion. Furthermore, consumers may build up a tolerance to shocking images. One commentator warned that shock ads were analogous to drug addiction; a larger and larger dose is required to achieve the desired effect until consumers eventually overdose on the strategy (Black, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_43">Klara, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec14_8">
<title>Photojournalism as Persuasion: The Camera Does Lie</title>
<p>Even without any accompanying text, photographs tell their own persuasive stories. Because there are entire courses offered in photojournalism, we won&#x2019;t attempt to explore the whole field here. What we wish to emphasize is that still photographs can make powerful statements. They can affect people&#x2019;s perceptions of events. They also can reach people on an emotional level in ways that words alone cannot. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_84">Zumwalt (2001)</xref> noted, &#x201C;There is tremendous potential in a photograph to inflame emotions&#x201D; (p. B12). Because photographs don&#x2019;t require literacy or familiarity with a particular language, they also are more universally understood than messages that rely on words. Photographic images also can distort reality, as we shall see.</p>
<p>Many well-known photos serve as iconic representations of events or eras in history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_35">Hariman &#x0026; Locaites, 2007</xref>). In all likelihood, you&#x2019;ve seen Joe Rosenthal&#x2019;s famous 1945 photo of U.S. Marines raising the Stars and Stripes at Iwo Jima. The picture symbolizes the determination of the United States to win the war in the Pacific. You may have seen John Filo&#x2019;s photo of a female student at Kent State University in 1970, kneeling over the body of a fellow student who was slain by the National Guard. That picture symbolized the schism between the protest movement and the government, as well as the generation gap of the late 1960s. You may have seen the photograph taken by Nick Ute in 1972 of a naked, 9-year-old Vietnamese girl, running down the road, with napalm burns from the bombs that had just been dropped on her village. The photo epitomized the feelings of many Americans that the United States was involved in an unjust war in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Photos can sum up social problems or controversies. They can document events in ways that words cannot. This is where the old saying, &#x201C;a picture is worth a thousand words&#x201D; applies. Owing to their iconicity, photographs can cement themselves in the public&#x2019;s mind. They function as touchstones that capture entire events in our collective conscience. The fact that so many cellphones now have cameras has elevated the role of amateur photographers. Photos can be uploaded instantly to Facebook, Twitter, and other social media.</p>
<sec id="sec14_8_1">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_356">356</target>Playing Tricks With the Camera: Photographic Deception</title>
<p>An important point to keep in mind about photographic images is that they aren&#x2019;t objective, impartial representations of things. The <italic>truth claim</italic> implied by a photograph can be misleading. All photographs are mediated by the photographer. Someone must aim the camera. Photographs give us the photojournalist&#x2019;s point of view, which is simply that&#x2014;one point of view. The photographer decides which events to capture on film, and which aren&#x2019;t worth preserving. The photographer decides on the distance, camera angle, lighting, shutter speed, and so on. The photographer decides which pictures to develop, how to edit or crop them, and which prints to offer for public consumption.</p>
<p>For example, photojournalists and news editors make decisions about which photos of war zones to publish and how gory or sanitized those images are. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_51">McEntee (2015)</xref> found that more graphic war photos (showing human carnage) evoked greater empathy than less graphic photos (showing building rubble). She contended that news outlets function as gatekeepers, deciding what the public sees, thereby shaping public opinion about conflict zones.</p>
<p>Some well-known historical and recent examples of photographic deception serve to illustrate how easily this medium can be manipulated. On June 27, 1994, <italic>Time</italic> magazine darkened O. J. Simpson&#x2019;s mug shot on one of its covers, making him appear more sinister and menacing. In the year 2000, a brochure for the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison was doctored by adding an African American student into a photo of fans cheering at a football game. The manipulation was done to make the campus seem more ethnically diverse. Kim Kardashian once &#x201C;broke the Internet&#x201D; with a photo of a champagne glass balanced on her behind. But when a non-airbrushed photo of Kim Kardashian&#x2019;s derriere surfaced on the Web, fans realized all her other photos were digitally altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_13">Cacich, 2017</xref>). She lost 100,000 Instagram followers in a week. Wait, her fans were unaware that she had some physical and digital sculpting done? Not to worry, with 99 million followers she can afford the loss.</p>
<p>Outside of photojournalism, photos also are not carbon copies of reality either. Political attack ads often show a politician at his or her worst. Fashion magazines show models at their best. When people join online dating services, they often alter their profile photographs to appear more attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_34">Hancock &#x0026; Toma, 2009</xref>). These examples underscore the point that seeing is not necessarily believing. Just because someone claims to have captured an image on film doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean the image is genuine and unaltered. <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box14_1">Box 14.1</xref> offers some useful suggestions on how to avoid being duped by photos and other visual media.</p>

<caption><title>On Your Guard: Remaining Vigilant Against Visual Deception</title></caption>
<p>Images, whether in the form of television commercials, cinema, magazine ads, photojournalism, Web pages, or other media, function as powerful tools for influence. They give us a vicarious sense of &#x201C;being there.&#x201D; For this reason, we must remain wary of visual communication designed to persuade us. We&#x2019;ve all seen supermarket tabloids with doctored photos claiming &#x201C;Martian now on Supreme Court&#x201D; or some other such nonsense. We know these images can&#x2019;t be trusted. But images may be manipulated by others as well. Politicians may manipulate images for propaganda purposes. Images <target target-type="page" id="page_357">357</target>may be manipulated by lawyers to make a defendant seem innocent or guilty (&#x201C;If it doesn&#x2019;t fit, you must acquit.&#x201D;). Images may be used by the media to increase ratings (&#x201C;Stay tuned, film at 11!&#x201D;) and by advertisers to sell goods (&#x201C;Get the body you want now!&#x201D;). With this in mind, we offer the following tips and advice when evaluating persuasive images.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Try to improve your <italic>visual literacy</italic>&#x2014;that is, the ability to critically analyze and evaluate visual communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_26">Felton, 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_55">Messaris and Moriarty (2005)</xref> note, &#x201C;visual literacy can &#x2026; be seen as a potential antidote to attempted manipulation of the viewer in TV, print, and Web-based advertising; visual journalism; and other forms of pictorial entertainment, information, or persuasion&#x201D; (p. 482).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Don&#x2019;t succumb to the adage &#x201C;Seeing is believing.&#x201D; The camera does lie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_12">Brugioni, 1999</xref>). What you are seeing may well be a manipulated image. When you see a fashion model on a magazine cover, for example, don&#x2019;t assume she or he looks that good in real life. The cover photo has probably been digitally altered to remove blemishes, whiten teeth, highlight hair color, etc.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Be especially wary of images on the Internet. Anyone can digitally alter an image on a home computer nowadays using Photoshop and mobile apps. If you are unsure whether to trust an image or not, try checking out some useful Web-based resources that identify hoaxes. Using Google, you can conduct a reverse image search (see <uri>www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5e9wTdAulA</uri>. <uri>www.Tineye.com</uri> also does reverse searches. We like <uri>www.snopes.com</uri> (check out their photo gallery link); factcheck.org, and Skeptical Enquirer, at <uri>www.csicop.org</uri>. For celebrity gossip, Gossip.com is useful.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When watching so-called reality shows on TV, remember they may bear little resemblance to reality. Reality shows are carefully engineered productions. Guests or contestants typically try out for the show and are carefully vetted. This selection process allows producers to cast contestants for maximum dramatic effect. Footage can be edited so that a contestant seems braver, cleverer, more devious, more hostile, or more psycho than she/he really is. Hosts may encourage or reward certain types of behavior while discouraging others. You don&#x2019;t really think that every guest on the Jerry Springer show threw a chair on his or her own initiative, do you?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When viewing documentaries, keep in mind that they do not objectively recount events. They advocate a point of view. Documentaries often use techniques such as re-enactment (recreating scenes for which no original footage is available), substituted or modified footage (film of something similar or related, but not the same thing), time compression (cramming years or even centuries into a one-and-a-half-hour-long movie), and composite characters (combining several different people into one). While all these techniques may make the story easier to follow and the narrative more compelling, they come at the expense of impartiality. Some exemplars of this genre, such as Michael Moore&#x2019;s <italic>Fahrenheit 9/11</italic> and Morgan Spurlock&#x2019;s <italic>Supersize Me,</italic> have been dubbed &#x201C;mockumentaries&#x201D; or <italic>&#x201C;shockumentaries&#x201D;</italic> because the director&#x2019;s bias is so intense.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Beware of images in diet ads, cosmetic surgery ads, supplement ads, and infomercials. Take a typical ad for a weight loss product: Notice that the person in the &#x201C;Before&#x201D; photo usually has a bland expression, poor posture, pasty skin, unkempt hair, unflattering clothes, and unflattering lighting. In comparison, the person shown in the &#x201C;After&#x201D; picture is usually smiling, has an upright posture, stylish hair, a tan and/or makeup, and flattering lighting. Does the ad say both photos are unretouched? Does the fine print acknowledge &#x201C;Results may vary&#x201D; or &#x201C;Results not typical?&#x201D; If a diet ad claims a user lost 30 pounds in two weeks, but you can see the person&#x2019;s hair is much longer in <target target-type="page" id="page_358">358</target>the &#x201C;After&#x201D; photo, then you would know that more than two weeks had passed between photos. Testimonials and the photos that accompany them are always subject to the &#x201C;hasty generalization&#x201D; fallacy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The context and captioning of images can have an important impact as well. Following the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, newspapers printed two photos of survivors wading in the flood water. One Associated Press photo showed an African American male clutching a six-pack of Pepsi with the caption &#x201C;A young man walks through chest deep flood water after looting a grocery store &#x201C; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14_63">Ralli, 2005</xref>). Another AFP/Getty photo, showed a white couple and carried the caption, &#x201C;two residents wade through chest deep water after finding bread and soda from a local grocery store.&#x201D; The captioning implied a clear double-standard: Blacks were looting, but white folks were acting out of necessity.</p></list-item>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In this chapter, we&#x2019;ve examined a variety of ways in which visual stimuli, including but not limited to images, facilitate persuasion. We have not touched on all the ways in which visual cues persuade. Yet the principles we&#x2019;ve discussed about how images persuade through iconicity, indexicality, and syntactic indeterminacy apply to other forms of visual communication as well. Our society is becoming increasingly visually oriented. More people now get their news from television than from newspapers. More people now watch movies than read books. Persuaders are capitalizing on this trend by enlisting images in support of their persuasive endeavors. Based on what you&#x2019;ve learned in this chapter, you should be able to watch a television commercial, see a movie, or read a print ad with a sharper eye toward the strategic choices made by the persuader. In short, we hope you will be a wiser consumer of visual persuasion.</p>

<fn id="fn14_1"><label>1</label><p>Most of our comments about cinematic persuasion apply equally to television shows. Television shows, however, typically have smaller budgets and tighter production schedules. Hence, they are less polished works. Nevertheless, many TV series have altered attitudes and behavior in the same ways as films.</p></fn>

<p><target target-type="page" id="page_364">364</target>PREVIOUS CHAPTERS HAVE DEALT with fairly &#x201C;mainstream&#x201D; types of persuasion. In this chapter, we examine more esoteric forms of persuasion. The topics we discuss in this section often receive short shrift or are neglected entirely by other texts. Yet we find that these are among the most interesting topics to students and laypersons. We include them here partly because they are so intriguing, partly because there are important research findings, and partly to debunk some of the myths and superstitions surrounding these topics. The topics we&#x2019;ll examine are color, subliminal persuasion, backward masking or reverse speech, neurolinguistic programming, music as persuasion, and the role of smell in persuasion.</p>
<sec id="sec15_1">
<title>Color as Persuasion: The Grass is Always Greener</title>
<p>Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona was known as &#x201C;America&#x2019;s toughest sheriff.&#x201D; Besides making male prisoners work on chain gangs, he also required them to wear pink underwear&#x2014;that is, until an appeals court overturned the practice. Wrote one justice, &#x201C;it is a fair inference that the color is chosen to symbolize a loss of masculine identity&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_27">Williams, 2012</xref>, p. AA-2). Whether one agrees with Arpaio&#x2019;s methods or not, clearly color was being used as an instrument of power and control.</p>
<p>In this section, we examine some of the ways in which color influences people. The meanings we assign to color are based, in part, on biology and, in part, on culture and socialization (Genschow, Reutner, &#x0026; W&#x00E4;nke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_9">2012</xref>). In nature, for example, red often serves as a warning, or <italic>aposematism</italic>, signifying toxicity. In human society, red often signifies danger as well. Ignore a red stop sign or a red traffic light, for example, and you do so at your own risk.</p>

<title>Color Coded at Birth: Dyed in the Wool</title>
<p>Color exerts an enormous influence on our lives&#x2014;and not just in our choice of undies. Take clothing colors, for instance. In much of the United States and Western Europe, newborn girls are swaddled in pink, boys in blue. Thus, gender differentiation, through color, begins in infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_22">Paoletti, 2012</xref>). In old Westerns, the good guys wear white hats, the bad guys black. Good and evil are thus differentiated by color. Business executives often wear &#x201C;power&#x201D; colors to signify their status. Brides traditionally wear white to symbolize their purity. Schools adopt uniforms to minimize clothes consciousness and focus students&#x2019; attention on learning. Soldiers and hunters wear camouflage clothing to evade detection. Scientists wear white lab coats, at least on TV, to convey their expertise. Gang members display their gangs&#x2019; colors to mark their turf. Sports fans wear color-coordinated clothing, or even face paint, to express their identification with their team.</p>

<title>Colorful Associations: A Blonde Walks Into a Bar &#x2026;</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter3">Chapter 3</xref>, we discussed the importance of attitudinal associations. We also have strong associations with colors. In politics, for instance, states are referred to as red or blue based on their political leanings. Likewise, we often classify occupations according to colors of collars: white, blue, and sometimes pink or green. The meanings attached to such colors shape our beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. For example, companies boast about their green initiatives&#x2014;which, not coincidentally, makes for good PR. A recent study shows this strategy is effective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_24">Seo and Scammon (2017)</xref> <target target-type="page" id="page_365">365</target>asked college students to evaluate a product, based only on its packaging. All versions included a label expressing support for the Sierra Club&#x2019;s environmental work. What differed was the color of the packaging: Green, red, blue, yellow, or gray. Products with green or blue packaging were rated more positively than the other colors.</p>
<p>The associations we have with colors are highly contextual. At a funeral, wearing black conveys grief or sorrow. At a nightclub, however, wearing black may suggest class or elegance. Red may signify sin in one context (red light district, scarlet woman) or reverence in another (the Pope&#x2019;s red shoes, red vestments). The meanings associated with colors are also culture bound. Traditionally, brides in America have worn white gowns, while brides in China have worn red gowns. That has changed, though, with more Chinese brides adopting the Western white wedding gown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_17">Labrecque, Patrick, &#x0026; Milne, 2013</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec15_1_2_1">
<title>Seeing Red</title>
<p>To better illustrate how associations with colors can affect attitudes and behavior, let&#x2019;s examine the color red in a specific context: Grading students&#x2019; papers. Has a teacher ever returned a paper to you that was &#x201C;bleeding&#x201D; with red ink? Did it make you feel like a dunce? If so, you are not alone. Studies on the <italic>red pen effect</italic>, as it is known, have prompted many school districts to encourage teachers to avoid marking papers in red, which is associated with failure, in favor of purple or some other color. You may scoff, but as it turns out, the color red significantly affects students and teachers alike. Studies show that even brief exposure to the color red before or during a challenging intellectual task can activate thoughts of failure and hinder performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_5">Elliot, Maier, Binser, Friedman, &#x0026; Pekrun, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_7">Elliot, Maier, Moller, Friedman, &#x0026; Meinhardt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_19">Lichtenfeld, Maier, Elliot, &#x0026; Pekrun, 2009</xref>). What&#x2019;s more, using a red pen affects the grader, too. Evaluators who graded essays using red pens identified significantly more mistakes than evaluators who used blue pens. Red pens thus predisposed the evaluators to grade more harshly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_23">Rutchick, Slepian, &#x0026; Ferris, 2010</xref>). Our advice: Give your instructor a purple pen when you submit your next paper. If you are a teacher, manager, or other evaluator, consider using a less pejorative color to minimize defensiveness. Even positive feedback in red may be ignored.</p>

<title>Color and Branding: Big Blue, Red Bull, and Pink (Victoria&#x2019;s Secret)</title>
<p>Not only do corporations use logos to identify their brands, they also rely on color. Color is &#x201C;a central aspect of a brand&#x2019;s visual identity&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_17">Labrecque, Patrick, &#x0026; Milne, 2013</xref>, p. 193). To illustrate, if you were told that a laptop was white, could you guess the brand? A Mac, no doubt. Color serves as an identifier for many brands, such as McDonald&#x2019;s (golden arches), Coke (red), and Rabobank (orange and blue). According to one source, color can increase brand recognition by 80 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_11">Goldstein, 2011</xref>). Philanthropic causes also use color to gain recognition. Livestrong&#x2019;s yellow wristbands and the Susan G. Komen Foundation&#x2019;s pink ribbons are cases in point.</p>
<p>In some instances, a color becomes synonymous with a brand, such as UPS&#x2019;s ubiquitous Pullman brown trucks or Reese&#x2019;s Pieces&#x2019; orange, yellow, and brown wrappers. What&#x2019;s more, the distinctive colors of a particular brand are often trademarked. T-Mobile&#x2019;s specific shade of magenta is a trademarked color. So is Tiffany&#x2019;s distinctive robin-egg blue. Owens-Corning even trademarked the shade of <target target-type="page" id="page_366">366</target>pink used in its fiberglass insulation. One of the ever-gullible authors bought a John Deere tractor largely because he liked its venerable green and yellow color, which is trademarked (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15_1">Figure 15.1</xref>). Companies protect their brand colors, too. Cadbury won a lawsuit for trademark infringement when Nestl&#x00E9; also tried to market a chocolate bar with a purple wrapper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_4">Clark, 2011</xref>). A similar suit was filed by high heel designer, Christian Louboutin, whose pricey shoes have distinctive red soles, against Yves Saint Laurent.</p>

<title>Color and Emotion: Mood Indigo</title>
<p>We often refer to emotions by color. You might hear someone say, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m feeling blue,&#x201D; &#x201C;He&#x2019;s seeing red,&#x201D; &#x201C;She was green with envy,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I&#x2019;m tickled pink.&#x201D; A meta-analysis revealed that different colors can and do affect our emotional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_13">Jalil, Yunus, &#x0026; Said, 2012</xref>). Individual color preferences, quite obviously, are a major determinant in whether a given color is viewed favorably or unfavorably. Generally speaking, warm colors such as red, orange, and yellow tend to be more stimulating, while cool colors, such as blue, green, and purple tend to be more calming. As Gob&#x00E9; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_10">2009</xref>) explains, &#x201C;Colors with long wavelengths are arousing (e.g., red is the most stimulating color that will attract the eye faster than any other) and colors with short wavelengths are soothing (e.g., blue, which actually lowers blood pressure, pulse, and respiration rates)&#x201D; (p. 80).</p>
<p>Consistent with this generalization, males rated a female wearing a red blouse as more sexually attractive than the same female wearing a blue blouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_6">Elliot &#x0026; Niesta, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_21">Niesta Kayser, Elliot, &#x0026; Feltman, 2010</xref>).

<p>Uniform colors also evoke different emotional responses in people. Suppose you were a little kid about to get a vaccination. Would the nurse&#x2019;s uniform color affect your anxiety level? It just might. One study found that blue uniforms were perceived by kids as more calming than white uniforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_1">Albert, Burke, Bena, Morrison, Forney, &#x0026; Krajewksi, 2013</xref>). For adult patients, nurses in white uniforms were perceived as more competent, professional, and efficient, whereas nurses wearing printed patterns were perceived as more caring, attentive, and approachable (Kucuk, L., &#x00C7;&#x00F6;mez, T., Ka&#x00E7;ar, S., S&#x00FC;meli, F., &#x0026; Tas&#x00B8;kiran, &#x00D6;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_16">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_25">Skorupski &#x0026; Rea, 2006</xref>). Thus, one color of scrubs might be better suited for an emergency room (ER) and another color or pattern for an intensive care unit (ICU).</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s consider another type of uniform. Imagine you&#x2019;ve just been pulled over by a police officer. Would the color of the officer&#x2019;s uniform affect your emotional state? Research shows that all-black uniforms are the most intimidating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_14">Johnson, 2005</xref>). Black is authoritative, commanding more respect and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_20">Nickels, 2008</xref>). However, a uniform consisting of a light-blue shirt and navy pants was judged to be more warm, friendly, and honest than all black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_14">Johnson, 2005</xref>). Which image is most important for cops to project?

<title>Color and Behavior: Hue Made Me Do It</title>
<p>Color influences consumer ratings of products and product purchases. Color is one of the first cues that we perceive about products, often before we can touch, smell, or taste them. The use of color in product packaging therefore matters a great deal (Lichtl&#x00E9;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_18">2007</xref>). A color&#x2013;product mismatch can turn off consumers. Would you buy Pepto Bismol if it were grey? Would you like Tidy Bowl if it made your toilet water red? We suspect not. Color also can be used to prime consumer reactions. In one study, participants were given orange or green pens to evaluate two soft drinks, one in an orange container (Fanta orange), the other in a green container (Sprite). Pen color functioned as a peripheral cue, such that ratings for Fanta were higher when using an orange pen and higher for Sprite when using a green pen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_2">Berger &#x0026; Fitzsimons, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Some of the ways in which color affects behavior are a bit weird. Take snacking, for example. When snacks are served on red plates or drinks in red cups, people tend to consume less (Genschow, Reutner, &#x0026; W&#x00E4;nke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_9">2012</xref>). Why? Partly due to biology and partly due to social conditioning, red evokes avoidance reactions. As noted earlier, red is associated with danger, risk, and hazards. This finding may seem trivial until you consider the current epidemic of childhood obesity in the United States and elsewhere. If simple measures such as serving meals on red plates or trays can help reduce food intake, they are worth considering by parents, school districts, and health agencies.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_368">368</target>The Color&#x2013;Aggression Link: Men in Black</title>
<p>A host of studies have examined whether uniform color affects sports performance. Does donning a black uniform make an athlete think, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m <italic>bad</italic>&#x201D;? An early study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_8">Frank &#x0026; Gilovich, 1988</xref>) found that NFL and NHL teams with black uniforms racked up more penalties. The finding was attributed, in part, to greater aggression by players and, in part, to selective perception by referees. Other studies have questioned the <italic>color&#x2013;aggression link</italic>, finding no differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_3">Caldwell &#x0026; Burger, 2011</xref>). A larger study, however, confirmed the link. Data from 25 NHL seasons (52,098 games) revealed that players wearing black uniforms were penalized more often, about two minutes of penalty time per game on average, than players wearing white (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_26">Webster, Urland, &#x0026; Correll, 2012</xref>). There may a &#x201C;chicken&#x2013;egg&#x201D; question involved as well. Do black uniforms make teams more aggressive or do more aggressive teams choose to wear black uniforms?</p>
<p>Color is not the &#x201C;be all and end all&#x201D; of persuasion. Nevertheless, color has an important supporting role to play on the stage of persuasion. Color can facilitate or inhibit influence attempts through associations, by activating attitudes or stereotypes, by evoking moods and emotional responses, and by altering behavior.</p>

<title>Subliminal Influence: Hidden Messages or Hokum?</title>
<p>A good deal of misinformation surrounds the topic of subliminal influence. Most Americans believe subliminal messages are not only common in advertising but that they are highly effective as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_33">Broyles, 2006</xref>). Public belief in subliminal persuasion dates to the 1950s, when James Vicary claimed to have flashed the words &#x201C;Eat popcorn&#x201D; and &#x201C;Drink Coca-Cola&#x201D; on a movie screen. Allegedly, popcorn sales increased by almost 58 percent and Coke sales by 18 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_51">Rogers, 1992</xref>&#x2013;1993). Thus was born an urban myth. Vicary never achieved the results he claimed. His so-called experiment was merely a publicity stunt.</p>
<sec id="sec15_2_1">
<title>The Laboratory Versus the Real World</title>
<p>The fact of the matter is that subliminal effects have been documented clearly and convincingly in controlled laboratory conditions but almost never in real-world settings. The examples found in the real world tend to be isolated cases rather than organized attempts at &#x201C;mind control.&#x201D; Most cases involving the use of subliminals appear to be pranks. Some Disney movies, for example, contain embedded images, but these appear to be acts of mischief by individual artists and animators rather than a corporate conspiracy (see, for example, <uri>www.snopes.com/disney/films/films.asp</uri>). Mind you, these cases only demonstrate that subliminal messages exist, not that they work.</p>

<title>What Is and Isn&#x2019;t Subliminal</title>
<p>Let&#x2019;s begin by clearing up some confusion surrounding the term <italic>subliminal</italic>. Literally, the term means below (<italic>sub</italic>) the threshold (<italic>limen</italic>) of human consciousness. Thus, a subliminal stimulus is one that is processed without conscious awareness. This is in contrast to <italic>supraliminal</italic> messages that are consciously processed. An image that is flashed so quickly that a person can&#x2019;t consciously register it is subliminal. An image <target target-type="page" id="page_369">369</target>that is fleeting yet recognizable is supraliminal. Subtle is not the same as subliminal. This distinction is important, because product placements in movies and TV shows are <italic>not</italic> subliminal. Advertisers <italic>want</italic> you to notice their products and/or logos.</p>

<title>Subliminal Advertising: Much Ado About Nothing</title>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, &#x201C;pop psychology&#x201D; books and magazine articles made it seem as if every ice cube in a magazine ad contained a hidden phallic symbol. Brian Wilson Key championed this view with his popular but unscientific books on subliminal advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_41">Key, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_42">1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_43">1980</xref>). We&#x2019;ve looked at the particular ads in question and, although we can discern some of the symbols and shapes Key mentions, we find his approach somewhat akin to staring at clouds. If one looks long enough and hard enough, one is bound to see a rubber ducky, the Virgin Mary, or some other vaguely discernible shape.</p>
<sec id="sec15_2_3_1">
<title>Embedded Images</title>
<p>More rigorous studies were carried out from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s, many of which focused on <italic>embedded images</italic>. Embedded images are buried or hidden within an advertisement. Researchers, however, were unable to substantiate any of the grandiose claims about hidden images making people want things or buy things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_36">Gable, Wilkens, &#x0026; Harris, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies examining embedded sexual imagery have found some effects, but only in controlled laboratory settings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_37">Gillith and Collins (2016)</xref> found that subliminal exposure to unclothed versus clothed opposite sex images increased the desire to have sex. This was measured, however, only by whether participants (mostly males) were more likely to choose a condom or a pen as a reward for participating. Another investigation (Wernicke, Hofter, Jordan, Fromberger, Dechent, &#x0026; M&#x00FC;ller, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_65">2017</xref>) using fMRI (neural imaging) identified some brain activity associated with subliminal sexual stimuli, but the findings were inconclusive.</p>
<p>Results like these led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_58">Trappey (1996)</xref> to conclude in his meta-analysis that &#x201C;the results show no significant positive or negative effect &#x2026; subliminal advertising does little to influence consumer behavior&#x201D; (p. 527). After reviewing 50 years&#x2019; worth of research on subliminal advertising, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_33">Broyles (2006)</xref> similarly announced that &#x201C;subliminal advertising just is not effective&#x201D; (p. 405). More recent books, such as Bullock&#x2019;s <italic>The Secret Sales Pitch</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_34">2004</xref>), also have been faulted for making unsubstantiated claims about subliminal ads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_33">Broyles, 2006</xref>).

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_370">370</target>Subliminal Priming: That Rings a Bell</title>
<p>There is scant evidence that subliminal influence works in advertising. In laboratory studies, however, a method known as <italic>subliminal priming</italic> has enjoyed considerable success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_29">Bargh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_44">Kouider &#x0026; Dehaene, 2007</xref>). A meta-analysis of masked prime studies found strong support for the technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_59">Van den Bussche, Van den Noortgate, &#x0026; Reynvoet, 2009</xref>). So compelling is the evidence for priming that Brintazzoli, Soetens, Deroost, and Van den Bussche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_32">2012</xref>) declared, &#x201C;the existence of unconscious subliminal perception is no longer questioned in an experimental context&#x201D; (p. 824).</p>
<p>Methods vary, but a typical priming technique is as follows. First, participants view a <italic>masked prime</italic>. The mask is simply a string of characters covering up a word. For example, the characters &#x0023;&#x0023;&#x0023;&#x0023; could be used to mask the word <italic>salt</italic>. Second, the mask is removed and the <italic>subliminal prime</italic> is presented. Thus, the word <italic>salt</italic> might appear for 30 milliseconds, too quickly to be consciously perceived. Third, a <italic>target word</italic> that is consciously visible, for example, the word <italic>pepper</italic>, replaces the prime. Participants who are primed by the word <italic>salt</italic> tend to recognize the word <italic>pepper</italic> faster than participants who are not primed.</p>
<sec id="sec15_2_4_1">
<title>Importance of a Prior Need or Drive</title>
<p>For priming to work, however, it appears that a prior need or drive state must exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_56">Strahan, Spencer, &#x0026; Zanna, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_60">Verwijmeren, Karremans, Bernritter, Stroebe, &#x0026; Wigboldus, 2011</xref>). That is, for a subliminal prime about food to work, a person must be hungry. For a subliminal prime about a beverage to be effective, a person must be thirsty. The need or drive state increases receptivity to priming. In a controlled setting, for example, participants were exposed to subliminal images of happy or angry faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_66">Winkielman, Berridge, &#x0026; Wilbarger, 2005</xref>). Then they sampled a lemon-lime-flavored drink. After reporting how thirsty they were, the participants were instructed to drink as much as they wanted. Participants exposed to the happy faces consumed much more of the new drink than those exposed to the angry faces, but only&#x2014;and this is the key&#x2014;if they were already thirsty. The amounts consumed by nonthirsty participants, whether exposed to happy or angry faces, did not differ significantly. Priming thus appeared to act as a trigger, but only for those whose thirst needed to be quenched.</p>
<p>Other studies have found similar results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_31">Bermeitinger, Goelz, Johr, Neumann, Ecker, and Doerr (2009)</xref> asked participants to complete a task requiring high concentration. Half were well rested; the other half were tired. Before completing the task, participants in each group were subliminally primed with logos for a sugar pill called Dextro. Primed participants, who were also tired, consumed far more sugar pills than those who were not tired. The investigators concluded that &#x201C;subjects&#x2019; choice of a specific product is influenced by subliminally presented information only if there is a motivational state congruent with the subliminally presented stimulus&#x201D; (p. 325).</p>

<title>Not So Fast: Limitations of Subliminal Priming</title>
<p>Although priming has been demonstrated in controlled laboratory settings, we wish to emphasize the practical limitations of this technique. Participants in laboratories are free from other distractions. They are instructed to pay close attention to the priming messages. The target words immediately follow the primes. The effects of priming are <target target-type="page" id="page_371">371</target>also fleeting. As Brintazzoli and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_32">2012</xref>) cautioned, &#x201C;the short-lived nature of the influence of subliminal information casts serious doubt on its effectiveness in everyday life and advertising&#x201D; (p. 825). What&#x2019;s more, the minor effects of priming in laboratory studies can be nullified simply by informing participants of the presence of a subliminal message and warning them not to be influenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_61">Verwijmeren, Karremans, Bernritter, Stroebe, &#x0026; Wigboldus, 2013</xref>). The real world is a very different environment, one chock-full of media clutter. A myriad of supraliminal stimuli vie for our attention. People don&#x2019;t always pay close attention to messages. We are aware of no studies demonstrating any commercial success at using subliminal priming.</p>

<title>Backward Masking and Reverse Speech: Turn Me On, Dead Man</title>
<p>Can satanic, backward-masked lyrics cause impressionable teens to commit suicide? That is what the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against Ozzy Osbourne&#x2019;s record label claimed. The suit charged that backward-masked lyrics on the <italic>Blizzard of Ozz</italic> album drove a teen to commit suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_40">Harmon, 1995</xref>). A similar suit was filed by the parents of two teens who committed suicide after listening to backward-masked lyrics on Judas Priest&#x2019;s <italic>Stained Class</italic> album (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_38">Goleman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_49">Phillips, 1990</xref>). In both cases, the judges ruled in favor of the defendants, citing the lack of any causal connection between the reversed lyrics and the teens&#x2019; deaths. The authors have listened to both albums and have experienced no suicidal tendencies. Justin Bieber tunes, however, are another story! All kidding aside, there are no credible studies showing that listening to reversed speech produces any effects. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_52">Smith (2011)</xref> noted, &#x201C;Psychological studies have produced no evidence that listeners are influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the content of backward messages&#x201D; (p. 539).</p>
<p>It is possible to infer meanings from reversed speech, but these may be a matter of coincidence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_62">Vokey (2002)</xref>, for example, noted that the phrase &#x201C;Jesus loves you,&#x201D; when played backward, sounds like &#x201C;we smell sausage&#x201D; (p. 248). Some rock songs do contain backward-masked lyrics (the Beatles&#x2019; song &#x201C;Revolution 9&#x201D; and Pink Floyd&#x2019;s &#x201C;Goodbye Blue Sky,&#x201D; for example) but, as is the case with subliminal messages, their mere <italic>presence</italic> doesn&#x2019;t prove their <italic>effectiveness</italic>.

<title>What Advertisers Really Do</title>
<p>Advertisers are not really interested in subliminals, subaudible messages, or reverse speech. What advertisers seek to do is to connect their products with favorable images and idealized lifestyles. Product placement is one way of accomplishing this. Placements in movies and TV exceed &#x0024;6 billion dollars per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_50">PQ Media, 2015</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_48">Morgan (2005)</xref> &#x201C;between 15&#x2013;30 products are inserted into every half hour of television programming&#x201D; (p. 62). Morgan Spurlock&#x2019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_54">2011</xref>) documentary <italic>The Greatest Movie Ever Sold</italic> lampoons this trend.</p>
<p>Placements may be blatant or subtle, but they are in no sense subliminal. Some product placements operate at a low level of awareness, but they remain a form of supraliminal persuasion. In sum, we believe consumers have little to fear from subliminal advertising at this time.</p>

<title>Neurolinguistic Programming: The Emperor&#x2019;s New Clothes</title>
<p>Did you know that by uttering a few magical words, you can get anyone to do your bidding? Some folks would like you to believe in such hocus-pocus. They claim <target target-type="page" id="page_373">373</target>that they can teach you, in a few easy steps, how to hypnotize people with your words. Some claim their techniques will help you get dates, overcome phobias, cure depression, improve spelling, alleviate colds and flu, and enlarge your breasts or penis.</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t reach for your wallet just yet. What these folks are peddling is based on <italic>neurolinguistic programming,</italic> or NLP, which is a mix of linguistics, psychology, and hypnotism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_71">Gow, Reupert, &#x0026; Maybery, 2006</xref>). The original theory, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_67">Richard Bandler and John Grinder (1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_68">1979</xref>), lies somewhere between pop psychology and junk science. It is popular with authors of self-help books, such as Tony Robbins, and others on the lecture circuit. Despite the extravagant claims, there is scant evidence that NLP works. Indeed, although one meta-analysis (Zaharia, Reiner, &#x0026; Sch&#x00FC;tz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_80">2015</xref>) found positive results when using NLP to reduce phobias, the authors acknowledged that &#x201C;there is a major lack of high-quality data from observational, experimental studies or randomized trials on this field&#x201D; (p. 361). What&#x2019;s more, most credible experts, e.g., those who don&#x2019;t stand to profit by writing, speaking, or training about the subject, denounce NLP as a form of pseudoscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_69">Corballis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_72">Gumm, Walker, &#x0026; Day, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_73">Heap, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_74">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_77">Sharpley, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_78">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_79">Thaler Singer &#x0026; Lalich, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The basic idea behind NLP is that a person&#x2019;s inner, unconscious mind determines how he or she responds to persuasive messages. All persuaders have to do is use a few clever linguistic strategies and&#x2014;presto!&#x2014;they can &#x201C;program&#x201D; another person&#x2019;s responses. Certain words and nonverbal behaviors allegedly have hypnotic power and evoke a subconscious reaction in people, or so the theory goes. They do this by activating a person&#x2019;s <italic>primary representational system</italic> (PRS), which is reflected in the five senses.</p>
<p>For example, a salesperson who sensed that a consumer was &#x201C;visually&#x201D; oriented, based on the consumer&#x2019;s language style, mannerisms, and gaze, could adapt a message to emphasize visual features about a product&#x2014;e.g., &#x201C;As you can see &#x2026;&#x201D; &#x201C;take a look &#x2026;&#x201D; &#x201C;watch this &#x2026;&#x201D; A salesperson who perceived a customer was &#x201C;auditory&#x201D; would adjust the sales pitch by saying &#x201C;I hear you &#x2026;&#x201D; &#x201C;it sounds like this is what you&#x2019;re after &#x2026;&#x201D; But how, you might wonder, does a salesperson know if a customer is primarily visual or auditory? According to NLP, a customer who looks up and to the left (memory) or right (invention) is accessing visual information; a customer who looks horizontally left (memory) or right (invention) is accessing auditory information (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_75">Lankton, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Although NLP&#x2019;s proponents assert that certain words and phrases have hypnotic power, their claims are suspect. The theory itself is nebulous and the evidence for its effectiveness is largely anecdotal. We agree that people respond reflexively to certain words, such as <italic>free</italic> or <italic>sale</italic>. That is a long way from saying, however, that specific words, phrases, and nonverbal cues have hypnotic power. By way of example, in one study, the investigators compared an indirect message using NLP with a direct message without NLP (Dixon, Parr, Yarbrough, &#x0026; Rathael, 2001). They found that the direct message without NLP was significantly more effective than the indirect message employing NLP. As the investigators concluded, &#x201C;Neurolinguistic programming may not be an effective device for improving the persuadability of messages&#x201D; (p. 549).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_374">374</target>In our view, NLP is much like the emperor&#x2019;s new clothes&#x2014;people believe in it because others seem to believe in it.

<title>Music As Persuasion</title>
<p>Have you ever heard an advertising jingle and then been unable to get the tune out of your head the rest of the day? Are you able to sing along to tunes like &#x201C;Break me off a piece of that ____ ____ bar,&#x201D; or, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m stuck on ____ ____ &#x2019;cause ____ ____ stuck on me&#x201D;? If so, you&#x2019;re not alone. In fact, advertising agencies spend big bucks developing &#x201C;earworms&#x201D; like these. What&#x2019;s more, 86 percent of prime-time television commercials include some form of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_82">Allan, 2008</xref>). And when you stop to consider the role of music in persuasion, it&#x2019;s easy to see why. Indeed, music facilitates persuasion in a variety of ways that we examine next.</p>
<sec id="sec15_4_1">
<title>Music as a Central and Peripheral Cue</title>
<p>Song lyrics persuade. The lyrics to the famous McDonald&#x2019;s song &#x201C;You deserve a break today&#x201D; offer a case in point. When song lyrics persuade, they may do so through what Petty and Cacioppo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_125">1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_126">1986b</xref>) call the central route to persuasion&#x2014;that is, the song lyrics are thought about and reflected on by listeners. This was the case with anti-war protest songs in the 1960s. It may be the case with rap and hip-hop lyrics today.</p>
<p>Music also can persuade via the peripheral route to persuasion. Peripheral processing occurs when listeners hear, but don&#x2019;t actively attend to, the music. You may, for example, prefer to study with music playing (or blaring) in the background. Background music can affect a person&#x2019;s mood or emotions, without the person&#x2019;s full awareness.</p>

<sec id="sec15_4_2_1">
<title>Music and Branding: What&#x2019;s That Song?</title>
<p>Music is often used to bolster a brand&#x2019;s image by creating favorable associations. As Danny Turner, the head of Mood Media, the company formerly known as Muzak, emphasized, &#x201C;major brands realize that to move forward &#x2026; positive, emotional connections have to be made&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s no better way to do that than music&#x201D; (cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_112">Lazarus, 2017</xref>, p. C1). Chevy&#x2019;s &#x201C;Like a rock &#x2026;&#x201D; song, for example, reinforces a rugged image for its pickup trucks. The congruity of a song with a brand, known as <italic>musical fit</italic>, affects consumers&#x2019; perceptions of a product or service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_118">North, Sheridan, &#x0026; Areni, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_140">Zander, Apaolaza-Ib&#x00E1;&#x00F1;ez, &#x0026; Hartmann, 2010</xref>). Coca-Cola, for example, has been particularly successful at pairing pop songs with its brand image of joy, happiness, and love (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_130">Sanchez-Porras &#x0026; Rodrigo, 2017</xref>). A Nielsen study found that TV commercials with music outperformed those without in four key areas; creativity, empathy, emotive power, and information power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_116">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Brand endorsements now appear regularly in song lyrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_102">Gloor, 2014</xref>). One study found that 30 percent of all songs, and 73 percent of rap songs in particular, included brand mentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_94">Craig, Flynn, &#x0026; Holody, 2017</xref>). For example, Busta Rhymes&#x2019;s hit &#x201C;Pass the Courvoisier&#x201D; is credited with increasing sales of the cognac brand by 30 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_100">Emling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_131">Schemer, Matthes, Wirth, &#x0026; Textor, 2008</xref>). In another song, <target target-type="page" id="page_375">375</target>Run-DMC love their Adidas. Lady Gaga&#x2019;s song &#x201C;Telephone&#x201D; mentions at least eight brands, including Miracle Whip, Virgin Mobile, and Polaroid. Some of these are paid endorsements, but many are not. Such endorsements appear to enhance brand identity, even if consumers know that the artist was paid for the brand mention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_135">Van Vaerenbergh, 2017</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec15_4_2_2">
<title>Mere Exposure Effect: Hearing Is Believing</title>
<p>Another way that music helps to sell products is through the <italic>mere exposure effect</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_136">Wang &#x0026; Chang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_139">Zajonc, 1968</xref>), which we discussed in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter9">Chapter 9</xref>. Repeated exposure to an unfamiliar stimulus increases liking for the stimulus over time. If a commercial includes a popular song or a likable jingle, repeated airings of the spot will facilitate liking for the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_105">Hargreaves, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_120">Obermiller, 1985</xref>). This is only true up to a point, however. Excessive repetition of a song or jingle can become annoying.</p>

<sec id="sec15_4_2_3">
<title>Music as a Mnemonic Device</title>
<p>Music also functions as a <italic>mnemonic device</italic> in advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_138">Yalch, 1991</xref>). A mnemonic device is simply a memory aid that facilitates recall. Can you remember which insurance company goes with &#x201C;We are ______________, Bum Puh Dum Bum, Bum Bum Bum&#x201D;? Hint: J. K. Simmons is the spokesman. Some tunes help the consumer to spell out the product&#x2019;s name and thus remember it. The Oscar Mayer bologna song is an example. Other jingles surround the product&#x2019;s name with positive associations. Can you fill in the company name for the tune &#x201C;Like a good neighbor, _____________ is there&#x201D;? If you are familiar with these commercials, you probably came up with the brand names. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_119">North, Mackenzie, Law, and Hargreaves (2004)</xref>, the right kind of music can increase brand recall by as much as 96 percent. To be effective, jingles must be simple. This is because the words in a jingle tend to be processed phonetically (e.g., as mere sounds) rather than semantically (as meanings).</p>

<title>Background Music: Shop Till You Drop</title>

In one of our favorite studies, researchers played either French or German music in a wine shop and kept track of which wines sold the most.

<p>In their meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_151">Roschk, Loureiro, and Breitsohl (2017)</xref> concluded that background music significantly increases pleasure, satisfaction, and purchase intentions.

<title>Music Videos and Persuasion: Is Hip-Hop Harmful?</title>
<p>A great deal has been written about the influence of music videos on the attitudes and behaviors of young people. Today, a typical music video is essentially a three-minute commercial for the artist, the brands that he or she endorses, and the lifestyle he or she espouses. There is little doubt that music videos influence fashions, trends, slang, sexual mores, and model social behavior. The question is how much they do so and how beneficial or detrimental the social proof found in music videos is.</p>
<p>Concerned parents and media critics have roundly criticized music videos for glorifying materialism and wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_110">Kalis &#x0026; Neuendorf, 1989</xref>), for being overly sexual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_104">Hansen &#x0026; Hansen, 1990</xref>; Kistler &#x0026; Lee, 2012), and for promoting sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_85">Barongan &#x0026; Hall Nagayama, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_124">Peterson &#x0026; Pfost, 1989</xref>). Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_134">Wright and Qureshi (2015)</xref> reported, &#x201C;1/3 of popular songs contain explicit sexual content and 2/3 of these references are degrading&#x201D; (p. 228). The <italic>general aggression model</italic> (GAM) posits that music can prime aggressive behavior by activating negative thoughts or scripts in listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_83">Anderson &#x0026; Bushman, 2002</xref>). Support for the GAM is well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_84">Anderson, Carnagey, &#x0026; Eubanks, 2003</xref>). A reverse effect has also been found, however, such that songs with pro-equality lyrics generate more favorable attitudes toward women (B&#x00F6;hm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_86">Ruth, &#x0026; Schramm, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_103">Greitmeyer, Hollingdale, &#x0026; Traut-Mattausch, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to musical genres, rap and hip-hop, in particular, have been singled out for criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_97">Dunbar, Kubrin, &#x0026; Scurich, 2016</xref>). &#x201C;Rap music,&#x201D; one group of scholars notes, &#x201C;has been blamed for youth violence, the rise of gangs and gang-related crime, drug use, and violence against women&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_127">Reyna, Brandt, &#x0026; Tendayi, 2009</xref>, p. 362). Some critics have warned that frequent exposure to rap and hip-hop is associated with illicit drug use, alcohol abuse, and misogyny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_81">Adams &#x0026; Fuller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_91">Chen, Miller, Grube, &#x0026; Waiters, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_122">Parker-Pope, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In response, defenders argue that rap and hip-hop music give a voice to the disenfranchised and serve as a medium for urban empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_127">Reyna et al., 2009</xref>). Proponents argue that some music videos make important socio-political statements and that others simply mirror the crass materialism and rampant sexism of the larger society. Rap and hip-hop artists respond that the mainstream media paint a distorted picture of rap and that the language and images used reflect the harsh realities of inner-city life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_88">Brown &#x0026; Campbell, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_90">Chambers &#x0026; Morgan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_95">Cummings &#x0026; Roy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_133">Tiddle, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_98">Dyson (1993)</xref>, for example, classifies rap music as a form of resistance that empowers African Americans.

<p>Whether one perceives the messages in music videos as positive or negative, it is difficult to deny that such music serves to shape attitudes, beliefs, intentions, motivations, and behaviors. This is particularly true for adolescents who are heavy viewers of music videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_93">Council on Communications and Media, 2009</xref>). One must be cautious about making direct causal inferences, however, between what juveniles <target target-type="page" id="page_377">377</target>see or hear and their subsequent behavior.

One officer commented, &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re a tough guy and you like rock or rap, you&#x2019;re not going to sit there and listen to Tchaikovsky&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_108">Holt, 1996</xref>, p. 2). In what has been termed the &#x201C;Manilow Method,&#x201D; the town of Rockdale, near Sydney, initiated a campaign to discourage teens from congregating at a park late at night. Music by Barry Manilow was played over loudspeakers from 9 p.m. until midnight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_106">Hirsch, 2007</xref>). We have to wonder, did the town pay Mr. Manilow any royalties?</p>

<title>Cautions: Face the Music</title>
<p>Before you get a hankering to use music to persuade others, bear in mind the following caveats. First, for music to be persuasive, there must be a good fit; the type of music must match the particular product, brand, purpose, and audience for which it is intended. Second, music shouldn&#x2019;t overpower the verbal content of a message. In a sales setting, for example, quieter music allows for more interaction between the salesperson and the customer. Third, music will probably have little effect on highly involved receivers who tend to concentrate on the substance of the message anyway. Music is best used on low-involved receivers who will process the message peripherally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_121">Park &#x0026; Young, 1986</xref>). In most cases, music functions as a useful supplement to verbal persuasion. Rarely can music be used as a substitute for verbal persuasion.</p>

<title>Aroma and Persuasion</title>
<p>Although few texts discuss the subject, smell plays an important role in the process of persuasion. Selling smells is a big business. Sales of fragrances and perfumes are expected to grow to &#x0024;51 billion by 2022 (Global Industry Analysts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_146">2016</xref>). Think of all the fragrances you can buy to make you feel better; you can douse yourself in cologne or perfume, scent your car&#x2019;s interior, and place air fresheners throughout your home. You can use scented deodorants, soaps, and laundry detergent, as well as scented dishwashing liquid and toilet paper. In addition to personal uses of <target target-type="page" id="page_378">378</target>fragrances, the use of ambient (background) fragrances in the workplace and in retail settings is beginning to play an increasingly prominent role. In this section, we examine the role of fragrances and aromas as forms of influence.</p>

<title>Perfume: Romance in a Bottle</title>
<p>The fragrance industry is one in which a product often &#x201C;wins by a nose.&#x201D; But is it the actual fragrance that sells or the associations that are paired with it? Scent alone isn&#x2019;t what sells perfume. The promise of romance sells perfume. The marketing themes associated with fragrances revolve around images of romance, intrigue, sensuality, and, of course, sex. &#x201C;Between madness and infatuation,&#x201D; a Calvin Klein ad proclaims, &#x201C;lies obsession&#x201D; (for Obsession perfume). The slogan for FCUK&#x2019;s fragrance was far less subtle. &#x201C;Scent to Bed,&#x201D; the ads proclaimed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15_5_2">
<title>Love Stinks</title>
<p>Through images and innuendo, fragrance ads create the impression that using their products will increase your sexual attractiveness. But do perfumes make any actual difference? Do they help attract dates, win over lovers, or make one feel better about oneself? Empirical research on this question is mixed, with some studies showing that fragrances increase attraction and others showing they do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_141">Baron, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_145">Cann &#x0026; Ross, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>An interesting study that casts doubt on the allure of perfumes was conducted by Hirsch (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_154">Stolberg, 1994</xref>). Male medical students were recruited as subjects for the study. Blood pressure monitors were attached to the volunteers&#x2019; genitals while they smelled a variety of fragrances, including Chanel No. 5 and Obsession. The <target target-type="page" id="page_379">379</target>results? The only smell that consistently increased blood pressure, the measure of sexual arousal used in the study, was that of cinnamon buns! The results seem to reinforce the adage that the way to a man&#x2019;s heart is, after all, through his stomach. As with the preceding study, these results may also be questioned. Let&#x2019;s face it, having an apparatus attached to one&#x2019;s genitals doesn&#x2019;t approximate a real-world setting for arousal (not for most folks, anyway). In such a clinical environment, the participants may not have responded as they otherwise would.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that scent is only <italic>one</italic> factor in the overall attractiveness equation. Other factors include such things as physical appearances, personalities, and common interests, to name but a few. One would be foolish, indeed, to believe that fragrance alone could serve as the basis for a meaningful, lasting relationship.</p>

<title>Ambient Aromas: Something Special in the Air</title>
<p>Although there is little research on the relationship between fragrance and attraction, there is a sizable body of research on the ways in which ambient aromas affect people. We consider three such ways here: Mood or emotion, task performance, and shopping behavior.</p>

<title>Aromas and Moods: Am I Blue?</title>
<p>Background fragrances have been shown to have a calming effect on patients in healthcare settings. For example, vanilla and heliotropin (similar to baby powder) reduced anxiety in patients undergoing an MRI scan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_150">Redd &#x0026; Manne, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_154">Stolberg, 1994</xref>). Researchers have found that scents can influence people&#x2019;s emotional states in nonmedical settings as well. For example, investigators asked college students to write a brief essay about a childhood memory. Half the students composed their essays in a room with a mild floral scent. The other half wrote in an unscented room. The students in the scented condition used happy, positive terms three times more <target target-type="page" id="page_380">380</target>often than their counterparts in the unscented condition. What&#x2019;s more&#x2014;and this is the part of the study we love&#x2014;students in both groups were then instructed to direct a mime to act out their childhood memory. Some 75 percent of the students in the scented condition touched the mime while giving directions, compared to only 15 percent in the unscented condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_159">Welsh, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Another of our favorite studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_147">Hanisch, 1982</xref>), because of its unusual method, examined whether pleasant fragrances could reduce arachnophobia (fear of spiders) among females. The researcher dangled a spider at varying distances from the participants&#x2019; faces. Part of the time, the participants were exposed to a pleasant, unfamiliar scent. Part of the time they were not. The pleasant fragrance reduced anxiety and allowed the spider to be placed closer to the participants&#x2019; faces than the no-fragrance condition. The researcher didn&#x2019;t mention whether the spider liked the fragrance or not.</p>

<sec id="sec15_5_3_2">
<title>Aromas and Task Performance: Smell That Productivity</title>
<p>One area in which scents have been shown to have an effect is task performance. Several studies have shown that mild fragrances can improve the speed, accuracy, and efficiency with which people complete tasks (Hirsch, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_154">Stolberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_152">Rotten, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_155">Sugano &#x0026; Sato, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_158">Warm, Parasuraman, &#x0026; Dember, 1990</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_143">Baron and Kalsher (1998)</xref> found that a pleasant ambient fragrance improved driving performance on a simulated driving task. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_142">Baron (1997)</xref> found that shoppers in a mall were more than twice as likely to help a stranger in the presence of pleasant ambient aromas (roasting coffee or baking cookies).</p>

<title>Scent Marketing: Follow Your Nose</title>
<p>Branded fragrances are increasingly being used to promote brand identity. Abercrombie &#x0026; Fitch was among the first to market its own fragrance, called <italic>Fierce</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_153">Smiley, 2014</xref>). Other brands soon followed suit. Cadillac, Lincoln, Marriott, United Airlines, and Verizon all have branded fragrances. As of 2017, Ikea was poised to launch its own fragrance. Early reports hint at the smell of cinnamon buns. We haven&#x2019;t gotten a whiff yet, but we think the true essence of Ikea should be redolent of the tears, bitterness, and frustration that comes with trying to assemble one of their products. Finally, in a bizarre twist of fragrance, the fast-food chain KFC created fried-chicken scented sunscreen. What better way to fight sunburn than to wade into shark-infested waters smelling like meat?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15_5_3_4">
<title>Ambient Aromas and Consumer Behavior</title>
<p>Retail stores are increasingly using ambient odors to motivate shoppers. But does pumping fragrances into the air make customers buy more? A meta-analysis of aroma studies found that background fragrances resulted in increased arousal, pleasure, satisfaction, and intention to purchase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_128">Roschk, Loureiro, &#x0026; Breitsohl, 2017</xref>). Other research has shown that pleasant ambient aromas can increase shopping time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_148">Knasko, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_156">Teerling, Nixdorf, &#x0026; Koster, 1992</xref>) and improve product evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_144">Bosmans, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>That said, researchers seem to agree that purchasing decisions are too complex to be influenced solely by smell, and not all studies find aromas to be persuasive. For instance, one study conducted in a shopping mall found no effects for background smells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_157">Teller &#x0026; Dennis, 2012</xref>). <target target-type="page" id="page_381">381</target>Not only that, one study shows that if consumers get wind of the fact that ambient aromas are being manipulated as a marketing ploy, they will become more skeptical toward the brand, the store, or the product in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15_149">Lunard, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Caveats and Qualifications</title>
<p>Before you rush out to buy a case of room air-fresheners to make you feel better, study harder, and work more efficiently, keep the following in mind: First, there are large variations in individual preferences for smells. A scent that works on one person may not work on another. One of the authors, for example, likes the smell of a skunk from afar. Second, as was the case with subliminal research, some of the effects reported in these studies may be attributed to a placebo effect. The participants&#x2019; expectations that smells affect behavior might account for the changes observed. Third, the repetitive use of scents can lead to counterconditioning such that an initially pleasant scent comes to be perceived as unpleasant. The smell of vanilla, for example, has been shown to be relaxing. But if it is introduced every time a child receives a vaccination, the smell may become aversive. Finally, there may be ethical as well as health-related concerns involved in using fragrances to influence people. People can close their eyes or look away from an image that offends them. They can&#x2019;t stop breathing or turn off their noses, however. We address ethical questions arising from the use of fragrances in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter16">Chapter 16</xref>.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In this chapter, we examined several esoteric forms of persuasion: Color, subliminal messages, subaudible messages, backward masking or reverse speech, neurolinguistic processing, music as persuasion, and smell as persuasion. Despite the public&#x2019;s belief in subliminal persuasion, subliminal effects have only been demonstrated in highly controlled laboratory settings. At present, subliminal priming is not commercially viable. Embedded words and images, subaudible messages, and backward masking have not been shown to influence people. Neurolinguistic processing is a popular, but unproven phenomenon. Music was shown to be an important component of persuasion. Music facilitates persuasion in a variety of ways such as reinforcing advertising images, serving as a mnemonic device, and influencing receivers&#x2019; moods. Though overlooked by most persuasion researchers, smell was also shown to be a useful tool for persuasion if the right conditions are met. Ambient fragrances can enhance moods, improve task performance, and influence consumer behavior.</p>

<p>&#x201C;THE MOST DANGEROUS ANIMAL in the world,&#x201D; it has been said, &#x201C;is a freshman with one semester of psychology.&#x201D; If that is true, then the second most dangerous creature must surely be a freshman with one persuasion class under his or her belt. If you give a child a toy hammer, the child will invariably find that every object he or she encounters needs pounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_33">Kaplan, 1964</xref>). In much the same vein, it is not uncommon for a student who has completed a course in persuasion to think that every communication encounter requires a test of her or his newfound skills. At best, this can be annoying to the recipients of the influence attempts. <target target-type="page" id="page_391">391</target>At worst, it can damage or destroy relationships if the persuader is perceived as being unethical. Like a hammer, persuasion is a useful tool. But one shouldn&#x2019;t use it to pound on others.</p>
<p>For this reason and others, we consider in this chapter the ethics of influence attempts. Although this is the last chapter of the text, it is by no means the least important. We decided to place this chapter at the end so we could discuss ethical concerns raised throughout the book. We make no bones about trying to teach you how to become a more effective persuader, as well as a more discriminating consumer of persuasive messages. Hence, we feel morally obliged to offer some prescriptions and proscriptions on the ethical uses of persuasion. Before you go out and attempt to wield your persuasive skills on unsuspecting roommates, absent-minded professors, unwitting family members, unfortunate co-workers, or hapless strangers, we want to make sure that you understand the importance of respecting others&#x2019; dignity, of showing concern for others&#x2019; welfare, and, as they say in comic books, &#x201C;of using your powers for good instead of evil.&#x201D; Quite seriously, we believe that the power to persuade carries with it a corresponding duty to persuade ethically. We don&#x2019;t claim to have a &#x201C;corner&#x201D; on the ethics market. Feel free to disagree with any of our guidelines, as you choose. Your time will be well spent thinking through the bases for your own ethical standards and in coming to terms with what you consider to be moral and immoral influence attempts.</p>
<sec id="sec16_1">
<title>Is Persuasion in General Unethical?</title>
<p>A frequent charge leveled against persuasion is that it is unethical. Some people equate persuasion with manipulation and see it as a one-sided approach to communication. Communication, they argue, should emphasize cooperation, trust, and shared agreement. We believe this view of communication is noble but overly idealistic. What happens when people don&#x2019;t agree? What happens when their goals contradict? Enter the need for persuasion. Persuasion is what people rely on when things aren&#x2019;t &#x201C;hunky dory&#x201D; or &#x201C;peachy keen.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We argued in the first chapter that persuasion is not a dirty word. But persuasion <italic>is</italic> used to do the &#x201C;dirty work&#x201D; of convincing others when disagreements develop. Attempts at convincing others, however, are not necessarily one-sided. Persuasion can be, and often is, two-sided. Persuasion can, and often does, result in mutually satisfactory solutions. Persuasion is not the antithesis of cooperation. Persuasion can be based on trust and mutual respect. In a relationship based on equality, for example, each party is free to influence the other.</p>
<p>As we noted in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter1">Chapter 1</xref>, persuasion performs a number of positive, prosocial functions. To the extent that some persuaders are unethical, it makes even more sense to learn how unethical influence attempts work and why they succeed. We don&#x2019;t deny that persuasion can be used in manipulative ways. Persuasion is a tool. Tools can be misused. In such cases, however, one should blame the tool&#x2019;s user, not the tool. By way of analogy, when someone uses the English language to belittle or demean another person, no one suggests that we should do away with language. Why, then, when persuasion is used unethically, do people blame persuasion rather than the persuader? Granted, some persuasive tools, such as fear appeals, hold greater <target target-type="page" id="page_392">392</target>potential for abuse, in the same way that a saw is more dangerous than a tape measure. Stronger safeguards need to be taken when using such persuasive tools, even when their use is for the receiver&#x2019;s own good.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16_2">
<title>The Motives Color the Means</title>
<p>Consistent with our tool analogy, James McCroskey commented that &#x201C;the means of persuasion themselves are ethically neutral&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_41">McCroskey, 1972</xref>, p. 269). Contrasting this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_28">Jacksa and Pritchard (1994)</xref> adopt the position that &#x201C;virtually any act of communication can be seen from a moral point of view&#x201D; (p. 12). We believe that ethics and persuasion are closely intertwined. We maintain, however, that the moral quality of an influence attempt is derived primarily from the <italic>motives</italic> or ends of the persuader, and only secondarily from the means of persuasion that are employed. In our view, the means of persuasion take on the moral character of the persuader&#x2019;s ends.</p>
<p>To illustrate, imagine that three persuaders each employ one of three influence strategies: deception, fear appeals, or ingratiation. Is it possible to determine which persuader is the most ethical or least ethical, merely by knowing the strategy each employs? We think not. We don&#x2019;t see how an ethical evaluation of the strategies could be made without any knowledge of the purposes for which the strategies would be used. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl16_1">Table 16.1</xref>, we list these three strategies (in column 1), along with two contrasting sets of motives (in columns 2 and 3). Notice that when paired with the first set of &#x201C;good&#x201D; motives, the use of the strategies appears justified. However, when paired with the second set of &#x201C;evil&#x201D; motives, the strategies appear highly unjustified.</p>

<p>Thus, in our view, the ethical quality of a persuader&#x2019;s motives tends to &#x201C;rub off&#x201D; on the persuasive strategy employed. The strategy itself is essentially neutral or amoral, until such time as it is paired with a particular motive or end. At that point, the entire influence attempt (motive and strategy) takes on a moral/immoral dimension.</p>
<p>In our view, a persuader&#x2019;s motives color the means of persuasion that are used, as the following examples illustrate.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_393">393</target>Ethics, Culture, and the Issue of Central Versus Peripheral Processing</title>
<p>We readily admit that some persuasive strategies may seem more ethically defensible than others. For example, the use of reasoned argument might seem more ethically justifiable than the use of flattery or charm. The use of facts and statistics might appear more defensible than the use of emotional appeals. This highlights a general preference among Western societies for logical, rational thought, consistent with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_46">Petty and Cacioppo (1986)</xref> call central processing. You may recall from our discussion of the elaboration likelihood model in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter2">Chapter 2</xref> that the central route to persuasion involves actively thinking about issues, reflecting on information, and scrutinizing the content of messages. The peripheral route, however, is based on factors such as source credibility, imagery, or social cues. In U.S. culture, the central route is generally the preferred route for persuasion.</p>
<p>Not all cultures place the same emphasis, however, on rational, linear thinking. Other cultures value different ways of knowing, favor other means of gaining adherence to ideas, and prefer other methods of securing behavioral compliance. As one example, some Asian cultures emphasize the importance of fitting in, of conforming to group norms, and of not &#x201C;rocking the boat.&#x201D; In such cultures, greater emphasis tends to be placed on <italic>indirect</italic> strategies of influence (such as hinting or stressing the importance of following group norms) than on <italic>direct</italic> strategies (arguing, open disagreement). The preference for indirect strategies reflects the importance of such cultural values as avoiding confrontation and preventing the loss of face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_54">Ting-Toomey, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_55">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_56">Ting-Toomey &#x0026; Kurogi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_60">Wiseman et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Within Western culture there are also exceptions to the general preference for &#x201C;rational&#x201D; persuasion. A person who comes across as being overly logical or emotionless, such as the character Mr. Spock of <italic>Star Trek</italic> fame, may be viewed as &#x201C;cold,&#x201D; &#x201C;calculating,&#x201D; or &#x201C;heartless.&#x201D; Similarly, the character of Dr. House, played by Hugh Laurie, displayed brusqueness with patients, indifference toward colleagues, and an acerbic tone with everyone. He was more interested in solving medical problems than the feelings of his patients. The ability to display compassion, convey empathy, and respond to the entreaties of others based on these same emotions is considered a desirable quality. Thus, even though it may seem that some forms of influence are more ethically defensible than others, this depends to some extent on cultural and situational factors.</p>

<title>Ethical Questions that Can&#x2019;t be Answered through the Study of Persuasion</title>
<p>We&#x2019;ve argued that the moral character of a persuasive act is derived primarily from the persuader&#x2019;s motives. Persuasion research, however, tends to focus almost exclusively on the means of persuasion (strategies and tactics) rather than on the motives of persuaders. For this reason, persuasion research is ill equipped to answer questions about what are good or evil ends. Take any current social controversy&#x2014;for example, abortion, assisted suicide, gay marriage, and so forth. The study of <target target-type="page" id="page_394">394</target>persuasion cannot tell a persuader what side of the controversy to be on. The study of persuasion can&#x2019;t enlighten persuasion researchers as to what causes are good or bad, or what values are right or wrong. Persuasion researchers tend to defer to moral philosophers, religious leaders, the judicial system, and other ethical arbiters to make such determinations.</p>
<p>As far as specific strategies are concerned, many professional organizations have established codes of ethics. Newspaper journalists, television news anchors, and radio commentators, for example, are bound by codes of conduct established by their national organizations or government agencies. A print journalist, for instance, should not publish a story without verifying the information via two independent sources. Even the Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA) has adopted a code of ethics (see <uri>http://womma.org/ethics</uri>). On the Web, however, anything goes. There are no clear-cut guidelines. Bloggers can post anything they want. Legislation regarding hate speech and cyberbullying on the Web is evolving.</p>
<p>Perhaps persuasion researchers should give greater consideration to the possible uses of the strategies and tactics they are busy investigating. Bear in mind, though, that it is difficult for a researcher to know how a particular tool of influence will be used. If a persuasive tool can be used for good <italic>or</italic> evil ends, what is a persuasion researcher to do? In <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box16_1">Box 16.1</xref>, we identify some well-known approaches to ethics that you might study in a course on ethics. In practice, individuals tend to follow a combination of the approaches identified in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box16_1">Box 16.1</xref>, making most of us ethical relativists. A complete discussion of the field of ethics and moral philosophy is beyond the scope of this text. Fortunately, several excellent works are available if you wish to learn more about ethics and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_8">Christians, Rotzoll, &#x0026; Fackler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_12">Duffy &#x0026; Thorson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_28">Jacksa &#x0026; Pritchard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_29">Johannesen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_30">Johannesen, Thayer, &#x0026; Hardt, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_44">Nilsen, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_47">Rivers, Christians, &#x0026; Schramm, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>The inability of persuasion researchers to distinguish good from bad applications of persuasion is similar to the situation facing other researchers in other fields. Consider the controversy surrounding the cloning of human embryos. The topic of cloning is fraught with moral implications. Scientists conducting this sort of research are aware that their research has ethical overtones. For the most part, however, they tend to focus on scientific questions related to cloning, as opposed to moral questions. After all, neither politicians nor clergy agree on the answers to the moral questions.</p>
<p>Persuasion researchers are similar to other researchers in this respect: They are simply interested in learning more about how persuasion works. Their focus is not on whether a particular strategy or tactic should be used. Nor is their focus on what causes should or should not be furthered using persuasion. We don&#x2019;t deny that persuasion researchers should take heed of the ethical implications of the strategies and tactics they are investigating. We merely wish to point out that persuasion researchers are more interested in pursuing knowledge for its own sake than on discovering techniques for mind control. We readily admit, however, that like Dr. Frankenstein in Mary Shelley&#x2019;s novel, persuasion researchers&#x2014;and all other researchers for that matter&#x2014;are ethically responsible for the knowledge they uncover and pass along.</p>

<caption><title>Approaches to Ethics</title></caption>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Ends versus means: An ethical controversy centering on whether the means or method of influence is justified by the desirability of the outcome. Can a persuasive outcome be so good or desirable that the use of force or coercion is justified to achieve it?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Consequentialism/teleological ethics: An ethical approach emphasizing consequences or outcomes. A persuader should weigh the benefits and drawbacks of his or her actions. Those actions that produce the greatest balance of good over bad are ethical.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Deontological systems/duty ethics: An ethical approach that focuses on moral imperatives, rather than specific consequences. A person has a duty to adhere to rules of moral conduct. One may be morally obliged to take some actions, regardless of their consequences.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Amoralism (or Machiavellianism): This ethical approach authorizes whatever a persuader can get away with, constrained only by laws, or fear of social ostracism. The self-interest of the persuader is all that matters; others better watch out for themselves. Suckers deserve what they get. They should learn from their mistakes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Situational ethics/relativism: This ethical approach maintains that there are no moral absolutes. There are no ethical maxims. It isn&#x2019;t possible to follow a moral code that applies to all cultures, persons, times, and places. There are always exceptions to every rule. There can be good or bad forms of persuasion, but whether they are good or bad depends on the situation, the parties involved, the nature of the issue, and other related factors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Universalism: This ethical approach maintains that there are universal, immutable &#x201C;dos&#x201D; and &#x201C;don&#x2019;ts.&#x201D; Morals and values can be translated into enduring codes of conduct. Some actions are right or wrong for all people, places, and times. For example, torture is always wrong. Certain universal human rights must be honored. There are &#x201C;hard&#x201D; and &#x201C;soft&#x201D; versions of universalism, meaning that some perspectives are more absolute than others.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Egalitarianism (also known as the &#x201C;Golden Rule&#x201D;): This approach to ethics involves doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. Treat other people as you would have them treat you. A more modern derivative of this principle is, &#x201C;What goes around comes around.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Free market ethics: This ethical approach is based on the metaphor of the free market or capitalism: caveat emptor, let the buyer beware. There should be little or no prior restraint on persuasive messages. This approach places greater responsibility on receivers to critically evaluate persuasive messages.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Utilitarianism (John Stuart Mill): This is a teleological approach, based on the greatest good for the greatest number of people. The Star Trek version of this principle involves balancing &#x201C;the needs of the many with the needs of the one.&#x201D;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>&#x25AA; Virtue ethics: This perspective focuses on the character of the person, as opposed to specific moral rules or moral actions. A person should strive to be virtuous, to have good character. Instead of relying on a list of dos and don&#x2019;ts, one should ask oneself, &#x201C;What kind of person do I want to be?&#x201D;</p></list-item>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_396">396</target>Our Approach: Characteristics of Ethical Influence</title>
<p>The authors claim no special expertise in the field of ethics. We certainly don&#x2019;t possess the moral credentials of a Mother Teresa or the Dalai Lama. We feel obliged, nonetheless, to offer our own set of guidelines and recommendations for ethical persuasion. Just as we believe the power to persuade entails a responsibility to persuade ethically, we also believe that teaching others how to persuade entails an obligation to teach them how to do so ethically. Our views don&#x2019;t emanate from a single ethical perspective, so we can probably best be described as <italic>situationalistic</italic> or <italic>relativistic</italic> in our approach (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box16_1">Box 16.1</xref>). We don&#x2019;t expect you to accept our advice as gospel. But we do hope you&#x2019;ll think about our guidelines and recommendations carefully. We believe that the more you think about the ethical dimensions involved in persuasion, the more conscientious you will tend to be as a persuader.</p>
<sec id="sec16_5_1">
<title>Ethics and Our Model of Persuasion</title>
<p>Recall that in our model of persuasion (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter2">Chapter 2</xref>), we distinguished between pure and borderline cases of persuasion. Recall also from our model that there are five criteria that distinguish pure cases of persuasion from borderline cases. Pure cases of persuasion are those that are intentional; they occur with the receiver&#x2019;s conscious awareness, involve free choice on the part of the receiver, take place through language or symbolic action, and involve two or more persons. We believe that the first four of these criteria hold important ethical implications for persuaders.</p>
<sec id="sec16_5_1_1">
<title>Intentionality</title>
<p>A number of scholars subscribe to the view that only intentional influence attempts count as persuasion. From an ethical standpoint, however, this view is problematic. We maintain that such a view lets persuaders &#x201C;off the hook&#x201D; for the unintended consequences of their persuasion. A persuader whose efforts result in harmful, unforeseen consequences can avoid responsibility by saying, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not what I intended.&#x201D; A persuader whose influence attempts reach the wrong audience can say, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not where I was aiming.&#x201D; Studies have shown that unintended messages, such as an overheard ethnic slur, can damage a person&#x2019;s reputation in the eyes of other persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_24">Greenberg &#x0026; Pyszczynski, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_35">Kirkland, Greenberg, &#x0026; Pyszczynski, 1987</xref>). Thus, we think that persuaders should be held accountable for the unintended consequences of their persuasion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16_5_1_2">
<title>Conscious Awareness</title>
<p>Pure cases of persuasion, according to our model, occur with the conscious awareness of the participants. Borderline cases of persuasion, however, require no such realization on the part of the participants. We maintain that persuasion that takes place with the conscious awareness of all the parties involved is far more ethical than persuasion that does not. If a person knows that he or she is the target of an influence attempt, he or she can take active steps to resist the attempt or counter with an attempt of his or her own.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16_5_1_3">
<title>Free Choice/Free Will</title>
<p>Pure cases of persuasion, according to our model, are those that allow participants to make free, informed decisions about whether they wish to comply with persuasive messages. Borderline cases of persuasion, however, involve coercion in varying degrees. We believe, quite obviously, that persuasive attempts that allow persons to make free choices are ethically superior to those that do not. Free choice includes the ability to question others&#x2019; influence attempts, to counter with influence attempts of one&#x2019;s own, and to resist complying with others&#x2019; attempts. As a general rule, we believe the more freedom one has to say &#x201C;No,&#x201D; the more ethical a given influence attempt is. This also explains why conscious awareness, discussed previously, is an important ingredient in ethical persuasion. A person cannot <italic>choose</italic> to comply with an influence attempt if the person is unaware that he or she is the target of an influence attempt.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16_5_1_4">
<title><target target-type="page" id="page_397">397</target>Language and Symbolic Action</title>
<p>According to our model, pure cases of persuasion center on the use of language (the spoken or printed word) and symbolic actions (protest marches, sit-ins, etc.). Borderline cases of persuasion include persuasion via nonverbal or behavioral means. Using physical attractiveness or behavioral modification to alter another&#x2019;s behavior would both constitute instances of borderline persuasion. We believe that persuasion that takes place through language or symbol usage is generally more ethical than persuasion via nonverbal or behavioral means. Our preference for the former is based on the fact that language-based influence attempts are generally more easily recognized and more readily understood. Nonverbal appeals, however, are less recognizable as persuasive attempts.</p>
<p>Of course, it is possible for persuaders to let receivers know that they will be the targets of nonverbal influence attempts or behavioral modification techniques. Sit-ins and protest marches, for example, are fairly obvious instances of nonverbal persuasion. If the recipient is made aware that nonverbal or behavioral strategies will be employed, we see little ethical difference between language-based and nonlanguage-based persuasion.</p>

<title>Persuaders as Lovers</title>
<p>In a widely acclaimed essay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_4">Wayne Brockriede (1974)</xref> suggested that arguers can be classified into three different types, based on their regard for the other person. &#x201C;Seducers,&#x201D; he argued, use trickery, deceit, charm, flattery, and beguilement to achieve their ends. Seducers do not view others as equals but as unwitting victims. &#x201C;Rapists,&#x201D; the second category identified by Brockriede, use threats, force, and coercion in an effort to win their arguments. They resort to browbeating, personal attacks, threats, and ultimatums to get their way. Like seducers, rapists view others as inferior. Others are treated as objects rather than equals. &#x201C;Lovers,&#x201D; the third of Brockriede&#x2019;s categories, respect one another&#x2019;s dignity and base their relationships on equality. They don&#x2019;t treat each other as victims or objects but rather as partners. They are open and receptive to one another&#x2019;s arguments and look for mutually satisfactory solutions to their differences.</p>
<p>We believe that Brockriede&#x2019;s characterization of these three styles of argument applies equally well to persuasive encounters. We draw upon and extend his approach here by ascribing what we believe to be three essential attributes or qualities of &#x201C;persuaders as lovers.&#x201D; The first quality is <italic>respect</italic>. Ethical influence attempts tend to reaffirm the other person&#x2019;s sense of self-worth. Persuaders who use ethical strategies <target target-type="page" id="page_398">398</target>and tactics tend to demonstrate respect for one another&#x2019;s dignity. In contrast, unethical influence attempts tend to express disdain for others. The target of an unethical influence attempt is viewed as a &#x201C;mark,&#x201D; a &#x201C;sucker,&#x201D; or a &#x201C;patsy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The second quality is <italic>equality</italic>. Influence attempts are most ethical when the parties enjoy equal status in a relationship. This is because in unequal relationships, status or power differences are more likely&#x2014;whether intentionally or unintentionally&#x2014;to impinge on the choice-making ability of the lower-status person. The person enjoying more status or power may find it difficult to resist using &#x201C;carrots&#x201D; or &#x201C;sticks&#x201D; to gain compliance. The person occupying the lower-status position may find it difficult to believe that the person with higher status will not resort to rewards or punishments.</p>
<p>We believe that ethical influence attempts are possible even when there are power disparities, but only if the more powerful party allows communication to take place, on an equal footing. In organizational communication, for example, the very concepts of &#x201C;downward&#x201D; and &#x201C;upward&#x201D; communication suggest inequality. To minimize such inequality, a superior could make it clear that he or she was suggesting, not ordering. The superior also would have to be open to having her or his mind changed as well. These same requirements&#x2014;suggesting, not ordering and remaining open to influence&#x2014;would apply to parental influence as well.</p>
<p>The third quality is <italic>tolerance</italic>. Each party to a persuasive encounter must be patient with the other, giving the other a chance to make his or her case. Each party should also be open to the other&#x2019;s point of view, making persuasion a two-way street. If a person wishes to influence another, we maintain that he or she also must be willing to be influenced. Turn-taking plays an important role in this process. Persuaders need to be willing to hear one another out. A person who enters a persuasive encounter with the mind-set, &#x201C;I will persuade, but I will not be persuaded,&#x201D; is not displaying tolerance for the other person or the other person&#x2019;s point of view. Taken together, we believe that these three qualities have the potential to make persuasive encounters more ethical and more pleasant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16_5_3">
<title>Bunglers, Smugglers, and Sleuths</title>
<p>Robert Cialdini, whom many consider to be the father of modern compliance-gaining research, suggests that persuaders can be categorized into three different types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_9">Cialdini, 1999</xref>). <italic>Bunglers,</italic> the first type, squander their prospects for influence by selecting ineffective strategies and tactics. As the name implies, they bungle their chances for success. Bunglers aren&#x2019;t so much unethical as they are inept. <italic>Smugglers,</italic> the second type, know exactly what they are doing but rely on unethical influence tactics. Smugglers, for example, wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate to use deception as a compliance-gaining technique if they thought it would produce immediate results. <italic>Sleuths,</italic> the third type, are more knowledgeable about how influence works than bunglers, and they are more ethical in their choice of strategies and tactics than smugglers. According to Cialdini, sleuths function like detectives who study a persuasive situation, searching for clues about the most ethical and effective means of influence. For Cialdini, then, the sleuth is the ideal persuader. He maintains that both individuals and groups (marketers, advertisers, corporations) should be sleuth-like in their influence attempts. The problem, he says, is that persuaders don&#x2019;t always recognize the long-term advantages of sleuth-like influence. &#x201C;The systematic use of <target target-type="page" id="page_399">399</target>misleading influence tactics,&#x201D; he maintains, &#x201C;ultimately becomes a psychologically and financially self-damaging process&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_9">Cialdini, 1999</xref>, p. 94). For example, the owner of a car lot who encourages the salespeople to use ethically suspect tactics to sell cars may sell a few more cars in the short run. In the long run, however, employee morale will suffer, repeat business will taper off, and eventually, the &#x201C;bottom line&#x201D; will suffer. If not for the sake of the persuadee, then, Cialdini suggests that ethical influence is ultimately in the persuader&#x2019;s best interest as well.</p>

<sec id="sec16_6">
<title>Ethical Issues Arising from Previous Chapters</title>
<p>Having offered some of our own guidelines for ethical persuasion, we now turn our attention to some of the ethical issues introduced elsewhere in this text. A number of ethical questions regarding persuasive strategies and tactics emanate from the preceding chapters. Here we examine some of those key questions and explore possible answers.</p>
<sec id="sec16_6_1">
<title>Ethics and Credibility</title>
<p>A number of ethical questions center on the use of source credibility as a tool for persuasion (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter4">Chapter 4</xref>). Among the key questions on the ethical uses of credibility are the following:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Is it unethical for a celebrity endorser to promote a product or service he or she does not actually use or about which he or she lacks expertise?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do we expect too much from politicians, professional athletes, and celebrities? To what extent should they be held accountable for errors in judgment, gaffes, and faux pas?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the use of authority become an abuse of authority if receivers place too much faith or reliance in a particular source? For example, can a TV evangelist hold too much sway over his or her followers, thereby clouding their judgment and independent thinking?</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>When celebrities endorse products they don&#x2019;t actually use, the problem tends to be self-correcting. The celebrity can be sued for breach of contract. This happened to Charlize Theron, an endorser for Raymond Weil watches, when she was photographed in public wearing another brand. Jessica Simpson and Teri Hatcher were sued for similar infractions. Sometimes endorsement deals can backfire when the products don&#x2019;t work. The Kardashians, for example, were named in a &#x0024;5 million lawsuit for making &#x201C;false, misleading, and unsubstantiated&#x201D; claims about Quick-Trim, a weight loss product that they claimed helped them shed pounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_36">Kotz &#x0026; Haupt, 2012</xref>, para. 1). A similar lawsuit targeted Shaquille O&#x2019;Neal for touting the benefits of wearing a Power Balance bracelet, which used &#x201C;holograms&#x201D; to optimize the body&#x2019;s energy flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_40">Malinowski, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>From time to time, sources say or do things that damage their own credibility. Such gaffes can haunt candidates, athletes, and celebrities. Olympic swimmer, Ryan Lochte, for instance, found himself in hot water after falsely claiming that he was robbed at gunpoint during the 2016 Olympics in Rio. It not only cost him <target target-type="page" id="page_400">400</target>multiple sponsorships, but hung his sponsors out to dry as well. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_15">Fong and Wyer (2012)</xref> found that a scandal involving a celebrity endorser resulted in more negative attitudes toward the endorsed product and decreased purchase intentions. Twitter now makes it easier than ever for a source to put a virtual foot in his or her mouth. Consider, for example, former Congressman and chronic &#x201C;sexter,&#x201D; Anthony Weiner, who might be considered the poster boy for regrettable tweets. The old adage &#x201C;think before you speak&#x201D; should now be amended to &#x201C;and before you tweet.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Because credibility tends to function as a peripheral cue, a reliance on credibility as the principal means of persuasion tends to short-circuit thoughtful deliberation. We believe that persuasive appeals that emphasize central processing are generally superior to those that emphasize peripheral processing. The former are ethically preferable, we believe, because they enable receivers to analyze messages, scrutinize evidence, and generally think for themselves.</p>
<p>We believe that a reliance on source credibility, at the expense of thoughtful reflection, is ethically suspect. In cases where credibility is used to enhance the persuasiveness of a message, we believe a qualified source should be used. By &#x201C;qualified,&#x201D; we mean a source possessing expertise in the area in which she or he is offering advice or making recommendations. Serena Williams, for example, knows a great deal about tennis, so her endorsement of a tennis racket brand would be meaningful. She&#x2019;s not an expert on vacuums, however, so her recommendation of a brand of vacuum cleaner would possess no more validity than that of the average person.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16_6_2">
<title>Ethics and Communicator Characteristics</title>
<p>We noted in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter5">Chapter 5</xref> that some receivers are particularly vulnerable to influence attempts. Young children, for example, have difficulty distinguishing what toys featured in television commercials can and cannot do. Patients with terminal illnesses are highly vulnerable to hucksters peddling &#x201C;miracle&#x201D; cures. Elderly citizens, some of whose mental faculties are diminished, are highly susceptible to scams perpetrated by con artists. And some new immigrants are uniquely vulnerable, because of their naivet&#x00E9;, language barriers, or both. Concerns such as these invite several ethical questions on persuasion aimed at specialized audiences:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What ethical safeguards should be followed when attempting to persuade children?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What ethical responsibilities does a persuader have when attempting to persuade highly vulnerable audiences?</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>With respect to the first question, we strongly believe that special care must be taken when persuading children, especially young ones. According to a policy statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics &#x201C;research has shown that young children&#x2014;younger than eight years&#x2014;are cognitively and psychologically defenseless against advertising&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_3">2009</xref>, p. 2563). They often cannot distinguish ads from programs and fail to grasp disclaimers attached to ads. Although a variety of private and public agencies already regulate mass media messages aimed at children, advertisers have been criticized for a number of unfair practices. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_58">Treise, Weigold, Conna, and Garrison (1994)</xref> commented:
<disp-quote>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_401">401</target>advertising to children promotes the use of products, such as sweets, that are harmful to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_22">Gore, 1989</xref>), manipulates and disappoints children with exaggerated claims; creates conflicts with parents over purchases; has the potential to influence children to experiment with alcoholic beverages and/or drugs (Atkin, 1987); and creates confusion over product and commercial distinctions (Kunkel, 1988; Englehardt, 1987).</p>
<attrib>(p. 60)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Of particular concern is children&#x2019;s exposure to media violence. As the American Academy of Pediatrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_3">2009</xref>) cautioned, &#x201C;Exposure to violence in media, including television, movies, music, and video games, represents a significant risk factor to the health of children and adolescents (American Academy of Pediatrics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_3">2009</xref>, p. 1495). Exposure to media violence increases children&#x2019;s social and physical aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_20">Gentile, Mathieson, &#x0026; Crick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_42">Murray, 2008</xref>). What is surprising is that even advertising aimed at children includes as much or more violence than advertising aimed at adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_32">Jones, Cunningham, &#x0026; Gallagher, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to following those strictures that are already in place, we would advise those seeking to influence youngsters to follow three basic guidelines. First, they should ensure that they have a parent or legal guardian&#x2019;s permission before attempting any persuasion. For example, before you decide to convince the next-door neighbor&#x2019;s child (spoiler alert) that Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny are myths, check with the parent(s) first. Persuading without such permission not only usurps parental autonomy but invites lawsuits as well. Second, they should communicate using words and concepts that children can understand. Persuasive messages should be geared to the developmental level of the age group being targeted. Third, they should make sure they have the children&#x2019;s best interests at heart. Whose interest was R. J. Reynolds promoting by using the now-discontinued &#x201C;Joe Camel&#x201D; campaign? Critics charged that the use of the cartoonlike character was a transparent attempt to attract underage smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_5">Bromberg, 1990</xref>). In our view, public awareness messages that target children for their sake (e.g., antidrug spots or stranger-danger messages) are less ethically suspect than for-profit advertisements that target children in order to make money.</p>
<p>With respect to the second question, there are clearly cases in which vulnerable groups are targeted by persuaders. As just one example, people who live in inner-city areas are subjected to more billboards promoting cigarettes and alcohol than people who live in more affluent, suburban areas. The poorer the neighborhood, the more billboards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_37">Kwate &#x0026; Lee, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We believe that many of the concerns involving highly vulnerable groups or individuals can be allayed by adhering to the aforementioned values of mutual respect, relational equality, and mutual tolerance. Part of the task of persuading vulnerable receivers involves displaying interpersonal or intercultural sensitivity. This includes the ability to empathize with others&#x2019; feelings and points of view. Part of the task also involves avoiding the temptation to prey on others&#x2019; fears, weaknesses, or vulnerabilities. The motto <italic>caveat emptor</italic> (&#x201C;let the buyer beware&#x201D;) may make sense when one is dealing with fully functioning, informed consumers. When applied to vulnerable groups, however, the motto simply becomes an excuse for taking advantage.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_402">402</target>Ethics and Deception</title>
<p>The study of deception and deception detection constitutes one of the most ethically sensitive areas of persuasion research. A number of ethical issues were addressed in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter12">Chapter 12</xref>. Of these, the overriding questions will be reexamined here: Is deception ever justified? Or, stated somewhat differently, is honesty always the best policy? How concerned should consumers be about online deception, including deception on social media?</p>
<p>Although some may believe that lying is always wrong, we believe that there are numerous situations in which telling &#x201C;white lies&#x201D; is beneficial for relationships. Such social rituals as complimenting another&#x2019;s clothing, praising your mother-in-law&#x2019;s cooking, or telling the host of a party that you had a good time seem like fairly harmless uses of deception to us. Even where candor is called for, we believe there is an important difference between being honest and being <italic>brutally</italic> honest.</p>
<p>Our view is that although deception is sometimes socially justified, one should examine the motives of the persuader by asking, &#x201C;In whose interest is the lie being perpetrated?&#x201D; Self-serving lies, we believe, are the least ethical. Lies told for the benefit of another, we maintain, are the most ethical. Research suggests that others hold this view as well. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_50">Seiter, Bruschke, and Bai (2002)</xref>, for example, asked people from China and the United States to rate the acceptability of various types of lies. Participants from both cultures tended to agree: They rated lies told for selfish reasons as unacceptable and lies told to benefit others as generally acceptable. In evaluating deception, one should also keep in mind that outright falsehoods and misrepresentations constitute only one type of deception. Deception can also include withholding information or purposeful ambiguity. The latter types of deception, we suggest, are more ethically defensible than &#x201C;bald-faced&#x201D; lies. A person might be &#x201C;diplomatic,&#x201D; for example, to spare another the pain or loss of face that being blunt might cause. Both withholding of information and purposeful ambiguity thus can be used to benefit another.</p>
<p>A final note on the &#x201C;honesty is the best policy&#x201D; approach is that it works only if some of the preceding conditions for ethical persuasion exist&#x2014;for example, if there is mutual respect, a relationship based on equality, and tolerance for one another&#x2019;s views. If these conditions do not exist, then being honest may simply result in the honest person being fired, punished, or ridiculed.</p>
<p>With regard to the second question on deception online, we believe there is some cause for concern. One reason is because social media are less regulated than traditional media, so consumers enjoy fewer protections. Another reason is that many people lack online media literacy. They are not as wary of peer-to-peer persuasion, word-of-mouth, and third-party endorsements as they should be. Online deception takes place in a variety of ways. One form is known as <italic>native advertising</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_53">Taylor, 2017</xref>). The &#x201C;native&#x201D; feature is that the ads are chameleon-like. They blend in with the social platforms in which they appear. For example, a native ad might have the look and feel of a Facebook or Instagram post. Suppose you were shopping for a handknit sweater for your dog. If you searched on Etsy for &#x201C;dog sweater,&#x201D; the top row of items found would be paid or promoted ads. As another example, BuzzFeed&#x2019;s series of &#x201C;Dear Kitten&#x201D; videos for Friskies cat food, were viewed millions of times and, according to BuzzFeed, made viewers 57 percent more likely to buy that brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_6">BuzzFeed, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_403">403</target>Native advertising is deceptive. Since native ads imitate the sites on which they appear, users may not recognize them for what they are. The Better Business Bureau has declared native advertising a deceptive practice, unless clear labeling is provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_27">Ikonen, Luoma-aho, &#x0026; Bowen, 2017</xref>). The Federal Trade Commission adopted guidelines requiring all native ads to include disclosures such as &#x201C;paid advertisement.&#x201D; A study by Media Radar, however, found that 37 percent of native advertisers failed to follow the FTC&#x2019;s labeling rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_14">Fletcher, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>A related technique involves <italic>sponsored content</italic>. Compared to native advertising, sponsored content is more informational and less commercial in nature&#x2014;hence the emphasis on content. What appears to be a legitimate news story, blog, or entertaining video showcases a particular person or organization as an <italic>opinion leader</italic> in a field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_26">Herrman, 2016</xref>). For example, Vani Hari, a self-proclaimed food activist, who goes by the moniker the &#x201C;Food Babe,&#x201D; blogs about healthy eating. She maligns major brands like Chick-fil-A, Panera, and Subway, while collecting reimbursements from smaller, cottage brands that she endorses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_49">Schultz, 2014</xref>). She also sells her own juice cleanses and sugar detox guides, even though she holds no degree in nutrition or food science. As another example, to promote its fantasy role-play game, <italic>Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor</italic>, Warner Brothers paid gaming enthusiasts to post online videos of themselves enthusiastically playing the game, without disclosing the payments. The FTC filed a complaint with Warner Brothers and a settlement was reached (FTC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_16">2016</xref>). FTC guidelines require that any for-profit arrangement between an opinion leader and a brand must be disclosed. The guidelines are routinely flouted, though, by including obscure acknowledgments such as &#x0023;sp (for sponsored product) or &#x0023;partner in Facebook or Instagram posts.</p>

<title>Ethics of Using Threats as a Compliance-Gaining Strategy</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter10">Chapter 10</xref>, we discussed a number of strategies and tactics related to compliance gaining. Among the strategies identified were threats of punishment. As a general rule, studies have shown that using threats achieves greater compliance than not using them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_19">Gass &#x0026; Canary, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_25">Heisler, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_43">Nevin &#x0026; Ford, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_57">Tittle &#x0026; Rowe, 1973</xref>). Their effectiveness notwithstanding, there are serious ethical questions regarding the use of threats. Hence, we focus here on the ethics of using threats as a means of persuasion: Is the use of threats of punishment ever ethically justifiable and, if so, under what circumstances?</p>
<p>Every attempt to persuade involves ethical questions. To a greater extent than with other influence strategies, however, we believe the use of threats should raise red flags in the persuader&#x2019;s mind. There are numerous reasons for this. First, we believe threats are unethical inasmuch as their effectiveness hinges on creating a state of psychological distress in receivers. Second, threats tend to be exploitative of power or status differences in relationships. Third, issuing and carrying out threats tends to diminish the morale and self-esteem of the recipient. Fourth, a reliance on threats is damaging and destructive to relationships. In the long run, threats do more harm than good. Fifth, the use of threats can foster resentment or trigger aggression toward the threatener. If you rely on threats, you&#x2019;d better watch your back. Sixth, threats must be carried out from time to time, an unpleasant prospect for both the threatener and the recipient. Seventh, the threatener is modeling a negative form of behavior for others to follow, thereby teaching others to rely on threats as well. Can you tell we&#x2019;re not too fond of threats?</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_404">404</target>When, if ever, then, should a persuader use threats? Our advice is that threats, although sometimes unavoidable, should never be the strategy of first resort. They should be used only when prosocial alternatives are unavailable or have failed and only when they are clearly in the best interests of the receiver or society. As an illustration, imagine that a spouse or an intimate partner is destroying himself or herself through alcohol abuse. The partner has pleaded with him or her to join Alcoholics Anonymous or to seek some other form of help, all to no avail. We believe that the partner would be justified in threatening, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m leaving you if you don&#x2019;t get help.&#x201D; Making such a threat, and following through on it if necessary, might well be in the long-term interests of both people.</p>
<p>Despite exceptions such as these, a reliance on threats produces so many undesirable social consequences that we think their use is rarely justified. A persuader who is contemplating the use of threats should, therefore, ask him- or herself if that is the only way to achieve an objective and if the objective is even worth achieving if threats must be used. Too often, we suspect that the use of threats represents reflex behavior on the part of the threatener. A reliance on threats can become habitual. If persuaders would reflect on their strategy selection more, they would recognize that prosocial alternatives are usually available and are more conducive to promoting and preserving relationships.</p>

<title>Ethics and Fear Appeals</title>
<p>Gloom and doom scenarios abound. Some commentators suggest that we have become a &#x201C;culture of fear&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_21">Glassner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_48">Ropeik &#x0026; Gray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_51">Siegel, 2005</xref>). We are bombarded with media reports of dangers lurking everywhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_2">Altheide, 2002</xref>). The research we reviewed in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter13">Chapter 13</xref> shows that fear appeals can be quite effective. Yet considerable caution should be used when employing fear appeals to promote constructive responses (e.g., danger control) rather than panic (e.g., fear control). We therefore posit two questions related to the ethics of using fear appeals.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Is it ethical to promote a &#x201C;culture of fear&#x201D;?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the use of fear appeals ever ethically justified and, if so, under what conditions or circumstances?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Many persuaders have a vested interest in scaring us. Politicians want our votes. The media wants ratings. &#x201C;If it bleeds, it leads,&#x201D; goes the journalistic adage. Pharmaceutical manufacturers want to sell us prescription drugs. But is the use of such scare tactics justified? Take the case of rare, exotic diseases for example. In the last half dozen years, the public has been warned about the Zika virus, Ebola or hemorrhagic fever, swine flu or H1N1 flu, mad cow disease or BSE, West Nile, SARS, the &#x201C;flesh-eating&#x201D; virus or necrotizing fasciitis, and Asian bird flu. As of 2016, however, no American had contracted Zika within the continental USA. One person in Salt Lake City died of Zika, but that person had traveled to a high-risk country. Similarly, only one person died from Ebola in the USA, and that patient contracted the disease in Liberia. In contrast, chicken pox kills about 100 people a year in the United States. Chicken pox, however, just doesn&#x2019;t seem as scary as Zika or Ebola, so it garners little media attention.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_405">405</target>There is a whole industry dedicated to scaring people about exotic diseases. Consider, for example, books such as <italic>Plague</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_45">Orent, 2004</xref>), <italic>The Coming Plague</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_17">Garrett, 1994</xref>), <italic>Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_18">Garrett, 2000</xref>), and <italic>Secret Agents: The Menace of Emerging Infections</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_11">Drexler, 2002</xref>). Scary, exotic diseases sell books. Tired of the same old scary diseases? Here are some exotic diseases you may not have heard of: fatal familial insomnia (death from lack of sleep), maple syrup urine disease (yup, MSUD makes your urine smell like maple syrup, but it can also cause brain damage and death), and brain worms (technically known as neurocysticercosis). Not to fear, perhaps some enterprising author will write a <italic>Maple Syrup Urine Disease for Dummies</italic> book in the near future.</p>
<p>Other persuaders profit from the public&#x2019;s fear of crime. We are assailed by stories of car-jackings, school shootings, freeway shootings, home invasion robberies, homegrown terrorists, serial killers, and child molesters. Yet, as a matter of fact, violent crime rates in the United States are near their lowest levels in three decades (FBI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_13">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_23">Gramlich, 2017</xref>). Consider child kidnappings as a case in point. Parents have a heightened fear of abduction-murders in the wake of high-profile cases such as those of Polly Klaas and Amber Hagerman. Terrible as they may be, however, child-abduction murders are extremely rare. The actual risk of a child being kidnapped and killed in the United States is roughly 1 in 1.3 million (Ropeik, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_59">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>). In comparison, the risk of a child dying from the flu is 1 in 130,000, a much greater risk. We don&#x2019;t mean to belittle parents for worrying about their kids&#x2019; well-being, but a parent who gets his/her child a microchip but doesn&#x2019;t get his/her child a flu shot is giving in to irrational fear.</p>
<p>New media and social media make fearmongering easier than ever. We&#x2019;ve been warned about cyberbullying, cybertracking, cyberstalking, and other cyber fears. Social media, however, are neither fact-checked nor carefully edited. Moreover, a single tweet, text, or post can go viral in no time. For example, following media chatter about face-eating zombies, the Centers for Disease Control felt compelled to issue a public statement saying there was no impending &#x201C;zombie apocalypse&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_7">Campbell, 2012</xref>). Similarly, after claims that a mermaid&#x2019;s body had been discovered, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) issued a disclaimer saying &#x201C;no evidence of aquatic humanoids has ever been found&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_39">Lynch, 2012</xref>, p. A12). Should we be concerned that the federal agencies have not denied the existence of vampires or werewolves?</p>
<p>We can&#x2019;t stop the fearmongers from practicing their trade. What we can do is urge you to use central rather than peripheral processing when evaluating fear appeals. Keep the numbers in perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_48">Ropeik &#x0026; Gray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_51">Siegel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_52">Simhan, 2004</xref>). When driving, be concerned about road rage (about 40 deaths per year), but be much more concerned about wearing your seat belt (9,200 preventable fatalities per year, according to the NHTSA) (Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_1">2005</xref>). When at the beach, worry about the risk of a shark attack (about three deaths per year in the United States), but worry far more about the risk of skin cancer from overexposure to the sun (about 8,000 deaths per year in the United States). Fret a little over exotic diseases, such as West Nile virus (100 deaths in the United States in 2004), but bear in mind that you have roughly the same chance of dying from a lightning strike (around 100 deaths per year in the United States) and a greater risk of drowning in a bathtub <target target-type="page" id="page_406">406</target>(more than 300 cases in the United States annually). Don&#x2019;t worry about zombies or mermaids at all.</p>

<p>Turning to the second question of whether and when fear appeals are ever justified, we maintain that if the dangers alluded to in a fear appeal are real or genuine, then we believe it is not only acceptable but desirable to evoke fear. People should be informed about dangers and hazards to which they are exposed. Two guidelines should be observed when using fear appeals. The first is that specific recommendations for avoiding the harmful consequences must be included in the appeal. The specific recommendations must tell receivers how to cope with the dangers identified.</p>
<p>The second recommendation is that the persuader should include concrete recommendations that tell receivers what they should do. In our judgment, fear appeals should never be used if the alleged harms are exaggerated or, worse yet, fabricated. Nor should fear appeals be used if receivers are given no recourse for avoiding the harms. What is the point in scaring people if there is nothing they can do about it?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16_6_6">
<title>Ethics and Emotional Appeals</title>
<p>Some people take the view that emotional appeals, which tug at receivers&#x2019; heartstrings, are unjustified precisely because they appeal to emotion rather than to reason. Persuasion, they say, should aim higher, at the mind, not the heart, and certainly not below the belt. In response to this concern, we raise the following ethical questions:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p><target target-type="page" id="page_407">407</target>Is playing on others&#x2019; emotions ethically justifiable?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are some types of emotional appeals better, or more ethically defensible, than others?</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Our answer to the first question is a qualified &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Recall from <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter13">Chapter 13</xref>, however, that the distinction between logical and emotional appeals represents something of an artificial dichotomy anyway. People tend to perceive messages they agree with as &#x201C;logical&#x201D; or &#x201C;rational&#x201D; and messages they disagree with as &#x201C;emotional.&#x201D; To the extent that logical and emotional appeals can be differentiated, we believe they work perfectly well side by side. We see nothing wrong with using emotional appeals, as long as their use complements, rather than contradicts or substitutes for, other more thoughtful approaches to persuasion. We do not think emotional appeals should constitute the sole means of persuasion, nor do we believe emotional appeals should be used if they contradict sound reasoning and evidence. As we mentioned earlier, our preference is for central processing of persuasive messages. To the extent that emotional appeals are used to promote peripheral processing, at the expense of central processing, we believe their use is undesirable.</p>
<p>An example of persuasion that combines emotional and rational appeals effectively is Whirlpool&#x2019;s Care Counts program, which provides washers and dryers to schools so kids have clean clothes to wear (<uri>www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxbipSM8GmA</uri>). The video begins with gloomy statistics indicating that students who drop out of school face higher unemployment, require greater government assistance, and are more likely to be incarcerated. Next, testimonials from children report that they are embarrassed or ashamed to go to school wearing dirty clothes. &#x201C;We have a washer and dryer at home,&#x201D; says one little girl, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just that our electricity was shut off.&#x201D; Whirlpool to the rescue. Pairs of washers and dryers were provided free of charge to 17 schools. Kids could bring their clothes to school to be laundered. Testimonials from teachers say the program improved attendance, class participation, and grades. Finally, statistics are presented, showing that over 90 percent of kids improved their attendance and at-risk kids attended nearly two weeks more than the previous year. The video has an emotional, &#x201C;feel good&#x201D; ending.</p>
<p>Despite potential limitations of the program (e.g., other, more significant barriers to school attendance), Whirlpool&#x2019;s program is a positive example of what is known as <italic>corporate social responsibility</italic> (CSR), in this case, by giving back to the community in the form of washers and dryers. Since the program is being expanded to more than 60 schools, it appears to be more than window dressing.</p>
<p>In answer to the second ethical question, we tend to believe that negative, divisive appeals are less ethically defensible than positive, prosocial appeals. When you think of emotional appeals, you may envision &#x201C;negative&#x201D; sorts of appeals, such as appeals to pity, shame, or guilt. Bear in mind, however, that emotional appeals have a positive side as well. Emotional appeals can be inspiring or uplifting. They can motivate us to try harder, to excel, to give our all. We hardly think that coaches, teachers, politicians, and clergy who provide emotional encouragement are behaving unethically. To the contrary, we believe that positive emotional appeals have a legitimate role to play in the persuasion process and that they function as useful complements to the use of reasoning and evidence.</p>

<title><target target-type="page" id="page_408">408</target>Ethics and Ingratiation</title>
<p>Everyone claims to hate brownnosers, unless the brownnosing is directed at them, that is. In his seminal work on the subject, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_31">Jones (1963)</xref> defined ingratiation, the polite term for brownnosing, as an &#x201C;illicit&#x201D; form of strategic behavior (see <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter13">Chapter 13</xref>). Thus, it would seem that ingratiation operates through unethical means. We thus explore the question: Is ingratiation an unethical practice or simply an honest acknowledgment of the way things work?</p>
<p>We sometimes tend to think of ingratiation as a form of deception&#x2014;that is, we envision the ingratiator as being disingenuous in his or her use of flattery. But what if the ingratiator <italic>believes</italic> in the praise he or she bestows on another? We see no problem with the use of praise or compliments if the persuader genuinely believes in what she or he is saying. In fact, this is one of the ethical questions that allows us to draw a &#x201C;bright line&#x201D; between what we consider to be ethical and unethical persuasion. Sincere compliments, we maintain, are ethical, and insincere compliments unethical. Genuine praise offers the prospect of a win&#x2013;win communication encounter. Both parties benefit. When a persuader pays a compliment and means it, he or she is demonstrating respect for the other person, and respect, we contend, is one of the essential ingredients of ethical influence attempts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16_6_8">
<title>Ethics and Visual Persuasion</title>
<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, as the saying goes, then is a misleading image equivalent to a thousand misleading words? Images are a powerful form of influence, as we noted in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter14">Chapter 14</xref>. Images are immediate and visceral. They evoke strong emotions. But images can be misleading too. When it comes to photographic evidence, determining what is real or fake can be difficult. There are multiple cases, for example, of prize-winning photographers who have been caught Photoshopping images, contrary to photojournalistic standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_10">Cooke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_38">Laurent, 2017</xref>). Thus, we raise the question: What social responsibilities accompany the use of images and other forms of visual persuasion?</p>
<p>Size matters. Optics matter too. You may recall the brouhaha over the crowd size at Trump&#x2019;s inauguration in 2017 compared to Obama&#x2019;s in 2009. A similar controversy emerged when the <italic>New York Times</italic> tweeted comparison photos of Donald Trump greeting the 2017 Super Bowl champion New England Patriots on the steps of the White House, versus Barack Obama greeting the Patriots team that won the Super Bowl in 2015. The photos showed a noticeably smaller turnout for Trump than his predecessor. What the <italic>New York Times</italic> failed to mention, however, was that in 2015 the coaching staff was standing on the steps alongside the players, whereas in 2017 the coaching staff were not on the steps, but on the south lawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_34">Kerr-Dineen, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We believe that persuaders have a responsibility for fact-checking the accuracy of documentary images before publishing them in traditional media or circulating them on social media. For the Super Bowl photos in question, the whole point of the tweet was to compare turnout. Shouldn&#x2019;t the source, then, have checked to see if there were coaches, not just players, in both pictures? It didn&#x2019;t take long for viewers and the Patriot&#x2019;s front office to complain that the 2017 photo excluded 40 members of the coaching staff.</p>
<p><target target-type="page" id="page_409">409</target>As a consumer of images, we believe that you bear some responsibility for fact-checking the accuracy of images before sharing, forwarding, or retweeting them, too.

<p>Nowadays optics matter as much or more than words. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16_61">Zimmer (2010</xref>, para. 3) noted, &#x201C;When politicians fret about the public perception of a decision more than the substance of the decision itself, we&#x2019;re living in a world of optics.&#x201D;</p>

<title>Ethics and Subliminal Influence</title>
<p>Unlike many other people, we aren&#x2019;t troubled by the use of subliminal messages. Why? Because, frankly, we don&#x2019;t believe they work outside of highly controlled laboratory settings. All of the research to date suggests that subliminal priming is not commercially viable. Thus, it is more as a matter of principle than out of genuine concern that we raise the ethical question: Should subliminal messages be allowed, and, if so, should they be regulated by the government or some other institution?</p>
<p>We feel much the same about the first part of this question as we do about the use of voodoo dolls. We&#x2019;d prefer that people <italic>not</italic> stick pins in dolls that resemble us, but we aren&#x2019;t much bothered by it if they do. As we noted in <xref ref-type="book-part" rid="chapter15">Chapter 15</xref>, subliminal priming works, but the effects are difficult to produce and highly transitory. At present, priming cannot make people do something they do not want to do, although under the right circumstances, it can reinforce an existing goal, need, or value. The practice of &#x201C;embedding,&#x201D; or hiding, images in advertisements has proven fruitless, as has the practice of planting subaudible oral messages. Other than disliking subliminals as a matter of principle, then, we believe there is little to fear from their actual use. If unscrupulous persuaders want to bombard us with subliminal messages, <target target-type="page" id="page_410">410</target>so much the better. The time and energy they waste on their fruitless endeavor may distract them from using other, more effective techniques of persuasion on us.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>We have argued in this chapter that persuasion is not an inherently unethical activity. To the contrary, we believe that persuasion can be used to advance all manner of positive, prosocial interests. Persuasion is a powerful tool that can be used for the noblest and basest of motives. Humankind&#x2019;s ability to persuade is thus both a blessing and a curse. Our view is that the moral quality of a given persuasive act is based primarily on the motives of the persuader and only secondarily on the strategies and tactics used by the persuader.</p>
<p>Based on our model of persuasion, we&#x2019;ve argued that pure persuasion is more ethically defensible than borderline persuasion. That is, persuasion that is intentional, that occurs with the receiver&#x2019;s conscious awareness, that involves free choice, and that takes place through language or symbolic action is more ethically defensible than persuasion that takes place via other means. Furthermore, we offered three qualities that we consider to be characteristic of ethical persuasion&#x2014;respect, equality, and tolerance.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined a number of ethical questions associated with particular topics and issues related to persuasion. We attempted to answer these questions as best we could&#x2014;without dancing around the issues on one hand and without claiming to have a corner on truth and ethics on the other hand. Above all, we urge you to contemplate the bases for your own ethical beliefs and not to let anyone else, including us, tell you what is right or wrong. The cause of ethics will be better served if you figure out for yourself what you ought, and ought not, do as a persuader.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ve told you about a number of tools of influence in these pages. Many of them have proven to be highly effective. Unfortunately, we can&#x2019;t give you a conscience to go with them (the publisher said it would be too expensive). We have to trust that you will let your conscience be your guide. When pondering which persuasive strategies you should use, think not only about the persuasive ends you are seeking but also about the kinds of relationships you want to have with other people. Long-term relationships, we&#x2019;re convinced, should never be sacrificed for short-term compliance. Mutual influence requires give and take, not just take, take, take. If you put people first and persuasion second, we think you&#x2019;ll be more successful in the long run than if you put persuasion first and people second.</p>
