<title>The colonial heritage</title>
<para>A major part of modern Cambodian history is dominated by the complicated nature of Cambodian–Vietnamese relations. History of violent relations between Cambodia and its neighboring countries, Thailand (formerly Siam) and Vietnam (formerly Annam), run deep through Cam - bodian collective memory. Seeing the potential danger of Cambodia being divided by the two hostile neighbors along the Mekong River, King Ang Doung of Cambodia (who came to the throne with Siamese support) began courting French authorities in Singapore around 1853.<sup>1</sup> Initially, this scheme was interrupted by Siamese threats, but in 1863, Cambodia had become a French protectorate.</para>
<para>Because of the French control, a large swath of territory known as Cochinchina (which was formerly Cambodian territory until the seventeenth century) eventually became part of the new Republic of Vietnam.<sup>2</sup> This alarmed many Cambodians especially given the history of Vietnamese expansion from the southern border of China, known as the “Southward March,” which completely destroyed the Champa Kingdom in 1832.<sup>3</sup> Many Cambodians saw the Vietnamese influence in its political affairs in the 1950s as potentially another episode in this expansion. This fear would come to engulf both the left-wing revolutionaries and the right-wing politicians.</para>
<para>Before the First Indochina War, the independence movement in Vietnam organized itself as the Indochina Communist Party (ICP). Between 1930 and 1954, a section of the ICP became the founding members of the future Cambodian leftist movement.<sup>4</sup> The Cambodian left-wing revolutionaries who would come to power later, considered the ICP as a Vietnamese ploy to dominate Cambodia.<sup>5</sup> The Cambodian communist movement eventually organized its own party, the Khmer People’s Revolutionary Party (KPRP), on 28 June 1951.</para>
<para>After Cambodia gained independence in 1953, Prince Sihanouk estab - lished the Sangkum Reastr Niyum party (Khmer for “populist society party”) and won a landslide victory in the general election in 1955. The KPRP also participated in the election, as did other minority right-wing parties, but did not win any seats in the national assembly. At this point, the communist movement in Cambodia had little hope of taking power from the popular <pageno=34 Road to war> Prince Sihanouk. However, complicated international events soon changed that situation.</para>
<para>Prince Sihanouk’s rule came at a difficult time. In order to avoid the adverse effects of the Cold War, Prince Sihanouk adopted a policy of neutrality and non-alignment. However, despite this official policy declara - tion, events forced Prince Sihanouk’s foreign policy to fluctuate between support for the United States and North Vietnam.<sup>6</sup></para>
<para>In 1959, several right-wing politicians and military officers were impli - cated in a failed coup attempt against Prince Sihanouk.<sup>7</sup> In his memoir, Prince Sihanouk wrote that he believed the US was behind the failed coup attempt.<sup>8</sup> On 26 April 1965, Cambodia broke diplomatic relations with the US.<sup>9</sup> Taking advantage of favorable conditions, North Vietnam tried to ensure that no communist movement in Cambodia threatened Prince Sihanouk’s rule in exchange for the Prince’s acquiescence of its sanctuaries along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border. North Vietnam insisted that the Cambodian communists should adhere to a political struggle (i.e. low intensity and long term) rather than a coordinated political–military one (i.e. potentially decisive).<sup>10</sup> The KPRP’s prospect for taking power was bleak. It had no army, no broad popular support, no external support, and the public wing of the party was under threat by the Cambodian regime.</para>
<para>It was amidst this confusion within the Cambodian communist party that a small group of new leaders emerged. These leaders would later establish the reign of terror in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 and bear the notorious name “Khmer Rouge.” The term “Khmer Rouge” started to appear in Prince Sihanouk’s speeches in the 1960s when he used the term to describe all Cambodian communists. “Khmer” denotes both the language of Cambodia and ethnic Cambodians while “Rouge” is the French word for “Red,” a popular denomination of all things communist.</para>

<title>The Radical Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK)</title>
<para>The communist movement in Cambodia was hit by one disaster after another. The KPRP participated in the general election in 1955, but did not win any seats in the national assembly. In addition, because Prince Sihanouk leaned towards North Vietnam in the 1960s, the latter cut off vital support to the communist movement in Cambodia to avoid antagonizing Prince Sihanouk. Finally, in 1962, the second man in the KPRP defected to the Cambodian government and helped the government hunt down many Cambodian senior communist leaders.<sup>11</sup></para>
<para>According to one account, in the midst of this upheaval, twenty-one junior members of the KPRP met at a secret location in Phnom Penh in 1963 to draw up a charter for a new party.12 The leader of this junior group named Saloth Sar, alias Pol Pot, was elected the new general secretary of the KPRP. According to a veteran of the KPRP, upon assuming the position of general secretary in 1963, Pol Pot changed the name of the party from KPRP to the<pageno=Road to war 35> “Communist Party of Kampuchea” (CPK) in an attempt to sever all connections with the ICP and the Vietnamese communists.<sup>13</sup> Many positions in the party were occupied by people close to Pol Pot.<sup>14</sup> People such as Keo Meas, who was a veteran of the KPRP and had close ties with the Vietnamese communists, did not hold any important post in the new party. Pol Pot changed the direction of the party and decided that armed insurrection was to be carried out in tandem with political action.<sup>15</sup> To the dismay of his North Vietnamese comrades, this new policy meant that henceforth, the overthrow of Prince Sihanouk’s regime was on the Cambodian communist’s political agenda.</para>
<para>While the communist movement in Cambodia undertook a revolutionary metamorphosis and secretly became the CPK, North Vietnam either did not know of, or paid little attention to, these developments. After all, it was already comfortable with the support it received from Prince Sihanouk. However, North Vietnam would soon come to regret this decision as the CPK shifted the policy towards the overthrow of Prince Sihanouk, thus driving a wedge between the Prince and North Vietnam.</para>

<title>Cambodia leaned right: policy shift towards the US</title>
<para>The implicit understanding between North Vietnam and Prince Sihanouk seemed to be that the Vietnamese revolutionaries could have free access along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border as long as they did not present any threat to the Prince’s regime. However, that changed on 2 April 1968 when a violent revolt took place in Battambang province (northwestern part of Cambodia, cf. <xref rid="map2.1" type="fig">Map 2.1). The event started out as a local rebellion by farmers who had no connection whatsoever with the Cambodian communist insurgents. Responding to the abuse of power by local officials, farmers in a village called Samlaut attacked a military outpost, killing two soldiers and capturing many weapons.<sup>16</sup> Pol Pot and his comrades took advantage of this situation and declared responsibility for leading the revolt in Samlaut, essentially an attempt to hijack the event and use it as a publicity stunt for his movement.<sup>17</sup></para>
<para>The Cambodian military responded to the revolt by attacking the villagers and burning houses, forcing hundreds or even thousands of farmers to flee into the nearby jungle and mountains. Prince Sihanouk received a detailed report on what had happened. As a result, he dismissed many local officials and forced his Prime Minister to resign.<sup>18</sup> However, Prince Sihanouk simply could not ignore the fact that the communists claimed responsibility for leading the revolt. That suspicion was confirmed when, after Samlaut, revolts in other areas became more widespread.<sup>19</sup> In the context of these simul taneous revolts, in addition to reports from some local authorities who had all the motivation to spin the information so that it would point the blame at others, Prince Sihanouk began to blame the communists for inciting the revolts.<sup>20</sup></para>
<para>This caused a significant foreign policy shift. Prince Sihanouk began to move away from supporting North Vietnam. Rhetoric against the communists<page>36 Road to war</page> increased, while the relations between Cambodia and the US started to improve. Cambodia and the US reestablished diplomatic relations on 11 June 1969, and in the last days of July, Cambodia sent a letter inviting President Nixon for an official visit to Cambodia. The government also imposed strict controls over the press to avoid antagonizing the US.<sup>21</sup> Moreover, Prince Sihanouk authorized the Cambodian military to take actions against the Vietnamese revolutionaries along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border.<sup>22</sup></para>
<para>North Vietnam, of course, could not be indifferent about these disturb - ing developments, because the loss of sanctuaries in Cambodia would prove disastrous for its campaigns in South Vietnam. On 5 July 1969, Huynh Tan Phat, Prime Minister of the newly formed, underground revolutionary government with links to North Vietnam, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam, paid an official visit to Cambodia to conclude some economic and trade agreements. The main objective of the visit was an attempt to observe the situation and to defuse the tensions resulting from these recent developments. However, the attempt failed when Prince Sihanouk publicly denounced the Vietnamese communists after the visit.<sup>23</sup></para>
<para>As the specter of a complete strategic reversal loomed large, North Vietnam began to look to the remnants of the Cambodian communist party, which was now controlled by the largely unknown Pol Pot, in an attempt
<fig id="map2.1">

<title></title>
</fig>
<pageno=Road to war 37> to find former allies for support.<sup>24</sup> Because Hanoi had no idea who Pol Pot was, it was faced with a dilemma: create a new, malleable Cambodian communist party to undermine Pol Pot and his CPK, thus further weakening the communist movement in Cambodia, or provide support, however temporary, to Pol Pot, at least until victory over the regime in South Vietnam was assured.<sup>25</sup> Hanoi chose the second alternative.</para>

<title>Full-scale war: the coup of 1970</title>
<para>On 18 March 1970, when Prince Sihanouk was on an official visit abroad, the right-wing politicians and the military carried out a coup to depose the Prince. On that day, the legislature voted, under duress, to remove Prince Sihanouk from power. The National Assembly made this decision behind closed doors while paratroopers took up positions around the National Assembly.<sup>26</sup> Soon after, the Khmer Republic was proclaimed.</para>
<para>The coup cut short the official visit of Prince Sihanouk in Moscow. Prince Sihanouk then flew to Beijing where he held a secret meeting on 21 March 1970 with Pham Van Dong (North Vietnamese Premier) and Zhou Enlai (Premier of the People’s Republic of China).<sup>27</sup> On 23 March, Prince Sihanouk broadcast a message from Beijing calling for his “children” (i.e. the Cambodian population) to go to the jungle and join the Maquis (a French term originated from World War II denoting resistance movement).</para>
<para>The coup in 1970 was unprecedented and provided a unique if somewhat ironic opportunity for Pol Pot. To be able to return to power, Prince Sihanouk had no choice but to rely on the communist Khmer Rouge. This enabled the Khmer Rouge to exploit Prince Sihanouk’s reputation to attract recruits and build its power base. The coup of 1970 effectively made the Khmer Rouge leaders the servants of Prince Sihanouk, while it positioned them for the future since it controlled the forces in the field. In addition, the Cambodian communists received military aid from both China and North Vietnam while their enemy, the Khmer Republic, received less and less aid from the departing American troops.</para>
<para>The Khmer new year of 1975 marked the final offensive on Phnom Penh. On 17 April 1975, the Khmer Rouge took the capital city. Their first step was the evacuation of the city.<sup>28</sup> The evacuation marked the beginning of Pol Pot’s paranoid and bloody reign. He believed that the “enemies of the revolution” were still hiding in the city, waiting to bring down the revolution after the war.<sup>29</sup> He believed the evacuation would disrupt these internal enemies before they could act.</para>

<title>Democratic Kampuchea: Cambodia’s dark age</title>
<para>Upon taking over, the Khmer Rouge established a new government called “Democratic Kampuchea.” This new government made a series of decisions that eventually led to its own demise. First of all, the Khmer Rouge turned<pageno=38 Road to war> against Prince Sihanouk since the support for Prince Sihanouk among the Cambodian people was still strong. Second, Pol Pot never felt safe from foreign intrigues. For him, the threat of a Vietnamese takeover was still a distinct possibility. To deal with these problems, he had to eliminate all enemies, internal and external. The external enemy was Vietnam and the internal enemy included those who had any relations with Vietnam and who planned to destroy the revolution from the inside.</para>
<sec>
<label>2.5.1</label>
<title>Prince Sihanouk: much vanity but no power</title>
<para>At the outset, the Khmer Rouge leaders sought to undermine Prince Sihanouk, who was seen as a liability and not trustworthy. In July 1975, the Khmer Rouge requested the return of Prince Sihanouk from China. Upon his return, Prince Sihanouk was immediately appointed as head of state of Democratic Kampuchea and even presided over a cabinet meeting.<sup>30</sup> However, just like the cabinet meeting that the Prince presided over, the title of head of state was nominal only. A few weeks later, Prince Sihanouk was forced to go to the United States to petition the United Nations where he successfully reclaimed the Cambodian seat for Democratic Kampuchea.<sup>31</sup> Not long after he returned to Cambodia, his requests to go to the countryside to meet his compatriots were repeatedly denied, and Prince Sihanouk finally decided to submit a request for resignation in 1976.<sup>32</sup> </para>
<para>In an internal meeting in March 1976, the Standing Committee of the CPK accepted the Prince’s resignation. The Khmer Rouge leaders never trusted Prince Sihanouk, and they feared that, due to the Prince’s immense popularity among the Cambodian populace (the Khmer Rouge cadres included), any contact between the Prince and the people would undermine their power. Prince Sihanouk survived under Democratic Kampuchea only because of the intervention of China. Nayan Chanda wrote that Mao Tsetung understood that when Pol Pot took power, he would no longer need Prince Sihanouk and perhaps might even try to harm the Prince. Fearing this eventuality, the ailing Mao struggled with his failing health to speak to the sister-in-law of Pol Pot and told her not to send Prince Sihanouk and his wife to the cooperative (i.e. hard labor).<sup>33</sup> This proved to be a lifesaver for the Prince and his family. After his resignation, Prince Sihanouk was held prisoner in his own palace, with no contact with the outside world, until January 1979 when Democratic Kampuchea collapsed.</para>

<label>2.5.2</label>
<title>Disaster of the Four-Year Plan (1977–1980)</title>
<para>The Khmer Rouge’s second major strategy was to reaffirm the collect - ivization of private property to maximize rice production. In early 1976, a Four-Year Plan (1977–1980) was announced. The Khmer Rouge divided the land into two categories. Normal land was required to produce three tons of rice per hectare (approximately 2.47 acres), while the best quality land<pageno=Road to war 39> was required to produce at least four to seven tons per hectare. It was this policy that led to famine and the brutal killing of people who were deemed enemies of the state because they could not meet the production target.<sup>34</sup></para>
<para>Apart from this simplified system, the Khmer Rouge also established the “cooperatives” system, which was a collectivization of land and private property. The cooperative was a production unit that could cover many hamlets and villages, depending on the scale of the rice fields and the number of workers. The Khmer Rouge abolished the market system and replaced it with this cooperative system. The cooperative was the place where people worked for subsistence. The chief of the cooperative determined the daily food ration for everyone under his control, and the cooperative was the only place where eating was allowed. Anyone caught eating outside of the cooperatives would be considered a traitor to the party and the revolution. The offender would be arrested and executed. Thus, the chiefs of the cooperatives had the authority to kill anyone they deemed “unnecessary” to the revolution. There was no law under Democratic Kampuchea. Justice rested on the will and the mood of the cadres.</para>
<para>The Four-Year Plan collapsed almost as soon as it was implemented and that was the genesis of the genocide.<sup>35</sup> The Four-Year Plan had three drastic consequences. First of all, it generated a famine. Second, as the laborers, weakened by malnutrition, could not work to raise production, they were either considered lazy or enemies of the revolution. Both of these offenses could easily lead to execution. Third, Pol Pot feared that the failure to meet targets must have been the conspiracy of internal enemies who plotted to overthrow the revolution. This led to many waves of purges, which devastated not only the ordinary people but also the Khmer Rouge cadres themselves.</para>

<title>Comrades at war: Vietnam’s southern march must be stopped!</title>
<para>The very first clash between Democratic Kampuchea and Vietnam occurred on 1 May 1975 when a battalion of the Khmer Rouge’s 164th Division invaded an island south of the Cambodian coast that was claimed by both Vietnam and Cambodia.<sup>36</sup> The attack was a debacle. Nevertheless, Vietnam did not take any large-scale retaliation for the event and still maintained diplomatic relations with Democratic Kampuchea. Perhaps still convinced that the Khmer Rouge was subscribing to the idea of world socialist revolu - tionary solidarity and the history of joint struggle, Vietnam did not take any major actions that might exacerbate the problem. However, the debacle following the invasion of the jointly claimed island only put a temporary halt to Pol Pot’s anti-Vietnamese policy, and it took him just one year to organize another army to fight with Vietnam on a larger scale.</para>
<para>In spite of the disparity in the number of men under arms in Vietnam and Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge did not hesitate to pursue an adventurous policy<pageno=40 Road to war> against Vietnam, because it believed its own propaganda that it had defeated the US in 1975. In this logic, war with Vietnam should go like clockwork. How the Khmer Rouge planned to overcome the Vietnamese numerical superiority can be discerned from a state radio broadcast on 10 May 1978. In this broadcast, the Khmer Rouge propaganda service briefed the nation about national defense situation between April 1977 and April 1978:</para>
<para>[W]e are few in number, but we have to attack a larger force; therefore, we must preserve our forces to the maximum and try to kill as many of the enemy as possible. . . . In terms of numbers, one of us must kill 30 Vietnamese. If we can implement this slogan, we shall certainly win. . . . So far, we have succeeded in implementing this slogan of 1 against 30; that is to say, we lose 1 against 30 Vietnamese. . . . We should have 2,000,000 troops for 60,000,000 Vietnamese. However 2,000,000 troops would be more than enough to fight the Vietnamese, because Vietnam has only 50,000,000 inhabitants. . . . We must use one against 30. This is just the number fixed by the Party, but in concrete, deeds of some of our comrades fought 1 against 10; we shall certainly win with 1 against 10 or 1 against 5. Some of our people have fought 1 against 20, and some have even tried to fight one against 50 or 1 against 100. There was no problem; they were still victorious.<sup>37</sup></para>
<para>The mathematics were simplistic, if not totally absurd. However, not long after the above broadcast, military campaigns by the Khmer Rouge against Vietnam restarted.<sup>38</sup></para> <para>Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge never ceased finding and eliminating suspected internal enemies. Suspects were arrested, tortured, and then forced to make new lists of suspects, which led to more purges. This purification policy destroyed the cadres of Democratic Kampuchea to a point where even the Chinese technicians who were sent to help the regime complained about the too frequent disappearances of their Cambodian counterparts.<sup>39</sup></para>
<para>Between 1976 and 1977, small-scale clashes between Khmer Rouge troops and Vietnamese troops along the border were very frequent. Both sides exchanged diplomatic correspondence as well as meeting frequently to try to resolve the conflict. However, most of those sessions tended to degenerate into mutual accusations and nothing peaceful came out of those meetings. Finally, on 24 September 1977, the Khmer Rouge launched a furious, and perhaps the most brutal attack of the war, on Tay Ninh province, killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians.<sup>40</sup> Focused on domestic reconstruction, the Vietnamese still pursued negotiation.</para>
<para>On the ground, however, the Vietnamese were less lenient than in previous small skirmishes and retaliated on a large scale. The Vietnamese seemed to have sensed that a non-response would be interpreted as weakness, even though at the same time, the Vietnamese felt the need to leave the channel for negotiation open. The Khmer Rouge ignored the call for negotiation.</para>
<pageno=Road to war 41>
<para>On 6 December 1977, the Vietnamese conducted a coordinated counterattack with brutal efficiency and completely stunned the Khmer Rouge. One can gauge the severity of the situation by looking at one of the Khmer Rouge’s telegrams from the battlefield. On 23 December, one Khmer Rouge commander, comrade Phourng, noted that the Vietnamese moved in very quietly and achieved surprise in many places.<sup>41</sup> Just fifteen minutes after the first telegram, Phourng relayed another message. The situation was getting worse:</para>
<para>For the Yuon [i.e. Vietnamese] situation on the 22nd of December 1977, they pushed forward to capture the Krek rubber plantation in its entirety . . . We lost contact with the rubber plantation and factory at Memot because the courier has not yet returned . . . This Yuon force, according to [our] soldiers, consisted of many trucks and many tanks. The fighting occurred against our forces chaotically, in front and in the rear of our artillery positions, and we could not discern which side was ours and which side was the enemy’s. According to my own analysis, we have lost control to a great extent, we lost communication between the troops and the command headquarters; and that was why the enemy could penetrate this deep with ease.<sup>42</sup></para>
<para>The Vietnamese army had moved in with only armor and motorized infantry. That was the reason why they could achieve breakthrough this easily. This was a classic blitzkrieg tactic. The Khmer Rouge operations probably ended in late December 1977. The following report reveals a total loss of control:</para>
<para>We have a hole in the middle with no large formation of troops. The rubber plantation’s militias could not fight and the big formations went to fight at the border for a long time and were now losing control and as we know, our brothers in the big formations were routed and could not yet establish communication.<sup>43</sup></para>
<para>In late December 1977, Democratic Kampuchea publicly announced the armed clashes with Vietnam to the world, as well as the fact that that it had broken off diplomatic relations with Vietnam. Vietnam unilaterally withdrew all of its forces from Cambodia despite gaining territory during the fight.<sup>44</sup> As late as 1977, it seemed Vietnam still had not been prepared to undertake anything drastic because it was not able to conceive a political strategy yet.</para>
<para>Defeat on the battlefield was not the main problem for the Khmer Rouge, however. It was the new wave of purges that destroyed the regime. By simply looking at the reports that were coming in, one can see that the Vietnamese could easily penetrate the rear of the formations and effectively disrupt the Khmer Rouge supplies and artillery support. Once that occurred, the front formations collapsed. One can easily see that the Vietnamese triumphed<pageno=42 Road to war> because of correct tactics, i.e. a blitzkrieg-type tactic. In the mind of the Khmer Rouge leaders, however, when campaigns initially ran so well and then immediately and inexplicably collapsed, this could only mean one thing: internal treachery that was perpetrated by Vietnamese sympathizers. Predictably, Pol Pot went out to destroy the internal enemies.</para>

<title>The East Zone put to the sword</title>
<para>In June 1977, when the Khmer Rouge was at war with Vietnam, internally, the purges of the cadres in an area along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, called the East Zone (a Zone was an administrative unit consisting of several provinces), was also under way. A junior Khmer Rouge commander in the East Zone named Hun Sen escaped to Vietnam after learning that his name was next on the execution list.<sup>45</sup> He also wanted to seek support from Vietnam in order to return to Cambodia and defeat the Khmer Rouge.<sup>46</sup> On 27 September, Hun Sen was allowed to meet with Lieutenant General Van Tien Dung, a member of the Politburo of the Vietnamese communist party, who was also the chief of staff of the PAVN.<sup>47</sup> At the end of the meeting, however, no explicit pledge for support was given to Hun Sen.<sup>48</sup> It seemed that as late as 1977, Vietnam still maintained some hope of negotiating with the Khmer Rouge. Perhaps that was the reason why Vietnam did not give any political or military support to the Cambodian refugees who had escaped to Vietnam.</para>
<para>For the Khmer Rouge, the year 1978 was eventful. It marked a much larger Khmer Rouge offensive against the Vietnamese. The most brutal attack of the war was launched in late February 1978 by the Southwest Zone and the divisions from the Central Committee of the CPK. According to one report, the second wave consisted of around 30,000 to 40,000 troops and was aimed at the Vietnamese Tay Ninh province.<sup>49</sup> However, just like in 1977, the Khmer Rouge campaign in 1978 was a total disaster.</para>
<para>In April 1978, the PAVN responded in kind with a multidivisional counterattack. Unlike in 1977, the Vietnamese now used tanks in greater numbers, as well as air support.<sup>50</sup> Khmer Rouge battlefield reports also revealed another important aspect of tactics used by the PAVN. In 1977, the Vietnamese moved swiftly with armor and motorized infantry to penetrate behind the Khmer Rouge lines, avoided strong points, and induced confusion and collapse of the main forward formations of the Khmer Rouge. In 1978, however, the Vietnamese pushed forward more slowly. While the Vietnamese counterattack in 1977 had been a blitzkrieg tactic, the counter-attack in 1978 was purely attritional. Perhaps, Vietnam wanted to weaken the Khmer Rouge as much as possible before involving the Khmer resistance groups organized from the refugees who had escaped to Vietnam.</para>
<pageno=Road to war 43>
<para>In April 1978, at the same time that the war reached its climax, Colonel General Tran Van Tra, the commander and chief political commissar of Vietnam’s Military Region 7, told Hun Sen that the Vietnamese leader - ship had already agreed to provide support for a Cambodian resistance movement.<sup>51</sup> Accordingly, an armed force, the “Kampuchean Solidarity Armed Forces for National Salvation,” was established on 12 May 1978. Eventually, by recruiting the Cambodian refugees who escaped to Vietnam, the resistance movement had twenty-one infantry battalions, one all-female battalion, and one hundred armed operations groups, while the units of the headquarters consisted of a general staff section, a political section, a logistics section, a finance section, one special forces company, one medical com pany, and one unit for military bands.<sup>52</sup> These forces operated out of the refugee camps in Vietnam’s Long Giao province. These “Long Giao battalions” were the genesis units of the Kampuchean People’s Revolutionary Army, one of the four factions to the war after 1979 (see Chapter 4).</para>

<title>Prince Sihanouk became useful to the Khmer Rouge once more: adding one more insult to injury</chapter>
<para>While the war on the border was raging, Prince Sihanouk was still kept in almost solitary confinement by Pol Pot. Nonetheless, in late 1978, Prince Sihanouk noted an unusual generosity and kindness on the part of the regime.<sup>55</sup> At dusk on 5 January 1979, a senior Khmer Rouge leader came to the house and told Prince Sihanouk that Pol Pot had invited the Prince for evening tea.<sup>56</sup> Prince Sihanouk’s relatives and the queen were worried that the invitation was the last one from the Khmer Rouge and that they would never see Prince Sihanouk again. But the Prince’s star was still shining: Pol Pot needed the Prince more than anything. Upon arrival at Pol Pot’s residence, Prince Sihanouk noted that Pol Pot was more courteous than ever before, prostrating himself to welcome the Prince, a standard Cambodian etiquette of respect for senior people and the royal family, something Pol Pot had never done before.<sup>57</sup> He also addressed Prince Sihanouk as “His Majesty.” Pol Pot dropped a hint about what he wanted Prince Sihanouk to do:</para>

<para>Pol Pot then briefed Prince Sihanouk that the Vietnamese would soon capture Phnom Penh, but reassured the prince that it would not be a problem, as the Cambodian soldiers and people would soon chase the Vietnamese out.<sup>59</sup> Ieng Sary and Pol Pot then carried out a “good cop, bad cop” routine to try to convince Prince Sihanouk of their sincerity. In Prince Sihanouk’s account, Ieng Sary said that only the Prince can go but the queen and the Prince’s relatives must stay behind.<sup>60</sup> But Pol Pot countermanded Ieng Sary and ordered him to make sure Prince Sihanouk and his entire entourage could leave Phnom Penh on the same flight.</para>
<para>Pol Pot then gave Prince Sihanouk $20,000 as pocket money for the mission, the money that the Prince returned in full after departing Democratic Kampuchea. In retrospect, we can see that the Prince had no choice but to agree. It was either take the money and leave, or perish under the Khmer Rouge for non-compliance. Vietnam sent a special forces detachment to rescue Prince Sihanouk so that the new regime could gain legitimacy through the Prince’s popularity, but this operation failed.<sup>61</sup> Prince Sihanouk had already left the Royal Palace the day before.</para>
