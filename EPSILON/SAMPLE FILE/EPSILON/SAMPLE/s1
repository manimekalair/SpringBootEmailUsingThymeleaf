   <p>A major part of modern Cambodian history is dominated by the complicated
   nature of Cambodian–Vietnamese relations. History of violent
   relations between Cambodia and its neighboring countries, Thailand
   (formerly Siam) and Vietnam (formerly Annam), run deep through Cam -
   bodian collective memory. Seeing the potential danger of Cambodia
   being divided by the two hostile neighbors along the Mekong River, King
   Ang Doung of Cambodia (who came to the throne with Siamese support)
   began courting French authorities in Singapore around 1853.<superscript>1</superscript> Initially, this
   scheme was interrupted by Siamese threats, but in 1863, Cambodia had
   become a French protectorate.</p>
   <p>Because of the French control, a large swath of territory known as
   Cochinchina (which was formerly Cambodian territory until the seventeenth
		century) eventually became part of the new Republic of Vietnam.<superscript>2</superscript> This
   alarmed many Cambodians especially given the history of Vietnamese
   expansion from the southern border of China, known as the “Southward
   March,” which completely destroyed the Champa Kingdom in 1832.<superscript>3</superscript> Many
   Cambodians saw the Vietnamese influence in its political affairs in the 1950s
   as potentially another episode in this expansion. This fear would come to
   engulf both the left-wing revolutionaries and the right-wing politicians.</p>
   <p>Before the First Indochina War, the independence movement in Vietnam
   organized itself as the Indochina Communist Party (ICP). Between 1930 and
   1954, a section of the ICP became the founding members of the future
   Cambodian leftist movement.<superscript>4</superscript> The Cambodian left-wing revolutionaries
   who would come to power later, considered the ICP as a Vietnamese ploy
   to dominate Cambodia.<superscript>5</superscript> The Cambodian communist movement eventually
   organized its own party, the Khmer People’s Revolutionary Party (KPRP),
on 28 June 1951.</p>
   <p>After Cambodia gained independence in 1953, Prince Sihanouk estab -
   lished the Sangkum Reastr Niyum party (Khmer for “populist society party”)
   and won a landslide victory in the general election in 1955. The KPRP also
   participated in the election, as did other minority right-wing parties, but did
   not win any seats in the national assembly. At this point, the communist
   movement in Cambodia had little hope of taking power from the popular <pageno>34</pageno>
