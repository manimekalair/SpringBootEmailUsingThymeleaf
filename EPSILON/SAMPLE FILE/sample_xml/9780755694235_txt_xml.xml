<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000030">Dirt - and our rituals to eradicate it - are as much a part of our everyday lives as eating, breathing and sleeping. Yet this very fact means that we seldom question what we mean by dirt. What do our attitudes to dirt and cleanliness tell us about ourselves and the societies we live in? This innovative work exposes the interests which underlie everyday conceptions of dirt and reveals how our ideas about it are intimately bound up with issues of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and the body. Exploring a wide variety of settings - domestic, urban and rural - it reveals how attitudes to dirt and cleanliness become manifest in surprisingly diverse ways, including the rituals of death and burial; architectural design aesthetics; urban infrastructure and regeneration; film symbolism; and consumer attitudes to food.</para>

The word has a broad range of associations, yet we seldom question what precisely we mean by it, or why exactly dirt needs to be cleaned. Materially, it refers at once to the mundane matter under our finger nails, down our toilets, on and under our streets &#x2013; hardly the reified substance of conventional academic enquiry, one might think. However, it is the everyday nature of dirt and cleaning, and their apparently &#x2018;natural&#x2019; delineation, that make them so important as objects of study. This volume of new work addresses the themes of dirt and cleanliness in relation to domestic, urban and rural space. Dirt is considered at a theoretical level, but also as that which slips easily between concept, matter, experience and metaphor. Collectively, the authors demonstrate the importance and potential of understanding dirt and cleanliness, and of acknowledging that they are located within and constitutive of space and social relations. In this introduction we outline the possibilities of these themes as a focus of investigation and analysis, before proceeding to introduce the structure and range of the following chapters.</para>
 <para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000092">The spatialities of dirt and cleanliness are revealed when we reflect on the history of concepts of cleanliness and cleaning practices.<footnote label="1" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000093" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000094">For recent work on dirt in relation to architecture, cities and space see also Ben Campkin and Paul Dobraszczyk (eds) &#x2018;Architecture and dirt: special issue&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">The Journal of Architecture</emphasis>, vol. 12, no. 4, September 2007.</para></footnote> In the &#x2018;modern&#x2019; West it is generally assumed that such practices, and acceptable standards of cleanliness, have been developed in a linear fashion in response to scientifically informed &#x2018;germ theory&#x2019;, which unquestionably explains what is <?page value="2"?>hygienic or unhygienic, and which chemicals, technologies and behaviours will banish the microscopic organisms that threaten to spread disease. However, when cleaning practices are examined closely we find that the daily processes intended to keep bodies, houses or cities free of dirt are not organized in direct relation to unquestionable scientific evidence.

The ordering of people in terms of their proximity to dirt operates both in relation to perceived personal dirtiness and responsibilities for cleaning dirt away. Dealing with physical dirt is both mundane and messy. Cleaning is a continual activity, yet not something we all do. In fact the doing, or not, of dirty work is divided down lines of class, ethnicity and gender &#x2013; the most powerful social divides in contemporary life. It is those on the &#x2018;losing&#x2019; sides of those divides who clean most &#x2013; the poor, women and people of colour &#x2013; while those with the social and economic power to avoid it <?page value="6"?>attempt to do so.

The nineteenth century expression &#x2018;dirty work at the crossroads&#x2019; referred to underhand activities, and suggests the association of urban intersections with accumulations of unwanted people and material. Cohen&#x2019;s &#x2018;theoretical crossroads&#x2019; is suggestive of the potential for the themes of dirt and cleanliness to drive interdisciplinary and comparative work.

While relevant theoretical work has emphasized psychological states and their correspondent social contexts, it has largely ignored cleaning itself. Studies of cleaning tend to emphasize histories of housework and servants, and technologies of cleaning, focusing on material practices, with little attempt to elucidate the broader meanings of dirt.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000213">At this point in history there was a clear and widely acknowledged correlation between class, cleanliness and cleaning work. Historian and heritage consultant Pamela Sambrook argues in relation to her examination of British country house servants between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, that a primary purpose of cleaning was to indicate status. Cleanliness marked higher status in a world where being clean was difficult, and the purpose of servants was to deliver that cleanliness, so demonstrating their employer&#x2019;s standing to the world.<footnote label="5" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000214" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000215">Pamela Sambrook, <emphasis role="italic">A Country House Servant</emphasis> (Stroud: Sutton Publishing, 2002) p. 222.</para></footnote> Household servants were employed to create an environment that was comfortable and that would clearly signal a householder&#x2019;s high standing, both through ensuring cleanliness and by caring for all the employer&#x2019;s goods, which were such important markers of rank. Therefore, it was not only the ability to afford to employ domestic servants that marked status, but also the actual product of their work.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000216">For most of the last 500 years having a clean house, as well as visibly clean and well-kept clothing and household linen, was a mark of high status because a clean habitat was so difficult to achieve. Cleanliness demonstrated how many servants were employed and how well those servants worked. The use of open fires, the difficulties of heating water and the lack of modern cleaning products, such as soap or washing powder, all meant that houses were dirtier and cleaning was more time consuming and difficult. Poor people could not maintain their houses and linen to the same standards as people who had servants to work for them, so cleanliness was a sign of wealth and status. Being able to maintain a distance from the dirt, which was everywhere, both inside and outside houses, was something that was only possible for the privileged few.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000217">The relationship between dirt and social status is an aspect of domestic labour that is rarely mentioned today. However, much paid domestic labour (like its unpaid counterpart) still reflects differences in status. Having a beautifully kept home and time for leisure can be an indicator of high status for the owner; being actively involved in dealing with dirt means low status for the worker who does it.<footnote label="6" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000218" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000219">See also Anderson, <emphasis role="italic">Doing the Dirty Work</emphasis>, p. 124, who refers to domestic workers as the &#x2018;status givers and myth makers&#x2019; of their employers.</para></footnote></para>

Rather than a conventional understanding of the domestic, in this chapter she extends to commoditized forms of domestic activity.</para>

Such practices include requiring domestic workers to use different cutlery and crockery from the rest of the household, and prohibiting them from washing their clothes in their employers&#x2019; washing machines. Barbosa argues that the design of Brazilian houses and apartment blocks builds such practices into the domestic environment because both the physical environment and the habits and actions of employers separate domestic workers within the home.</para>

The author argues that during the postwar period a shift took place from temporally-structured practices, such as the emphasis on seasonal (spring) cleaning and the weekly wash, to visually-determined forms of behaviour that prioritize the appearance of dirt rather than cleaning routines. The visual impetus to clean may have driven standards of cleanliness upwards, for householders no longer wait for it to be &#x2018;time&#x2019; to clean, while they may also have an effect on the choice of surface materials and other features of interior decoration given that certain materials reveal dirt more easily than others.</para>

She reads this as a process of metaphorical sanitization for the benefit of the recently bereaved. The chapter traces how modern funeral homes have been carefully designed to echo the respectability and calm of upper-middle-class dwellings; from their location in suburban neighbourhoods to the choice of d&#x00E9;cor and furniture. However, inside they are laid out so that the living can move through them without coming into proximity with the corpse. It is only through the process of embalming that the dead body is considered to be cleansed and is then permitted into the more public spaces of the home.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000232">In this chapter I consider several different conceptualizations of dirt and &#x2018;dirty work&#x2019; and their place in social theory.<footnote label="1" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000233" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000234">I thank Terry Lovell and the editors of this volume for comments on an earlier draft.</para></footnote> At first sight, one can identify two leading trends in the literature. Postmodern and/or poststructural dirt is purified through abstraction, prettified, much like old neighbourhoods. The apparently polar opposite is the idea of &#x2018;real dirt&#x2019; &#x2013; one can smell it, feel it, it is undeniably disgusting. Although people can become acclimatized, one has an &#x2018;instinctive reaction&#x2019;. Real dirt is credited with an objective status, for instance as an agent of infection, and is removable only by physical means.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000235">Here I argue that this simple, binary way of categorizing conceptualizations of dirt may hide a more complex and interesting array of theoretical postures. In particular, <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000262"><primary>critical realism</primary></indexterm>critical realism can help to prise apart the binary between linguistic leakiness and the &#x2018;really dirty&#x2019;, making a space for a sociology of dirt that does not have to choose. Critical realists argue that we can, and indeed must, recognize that social phenomena &#x2018;really&#x2019; exist, even while being ready to acknowledge that their construction inevitably depends on human activities, including the use of language.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000236">After outlining the binary between naturalistic and social constructionist views of dirt and dirtiness in more detail, I consider two areas of research and debate in which dirt features as a central axis of analysis and debate. My first <?page value="16"?><indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000774"><primary>prostitutes</primary></indexterm>example is research on how gender divisions influence the strategies of people whose paid work involves contact with disgusting substances. Second, I go on to another example of work that is frequently characterized in terms of its &#x2018;dirtiness&#x2019;, prostitution, and consider differences between feminist commentators in how they deal with this. Both examples suggest that rather than highlighting the symbolic construction of dirt in culture, we should focus instead on how the powers, strategies and constraints available to different social groups underpin lived experiences of dirt.</para>

The body is taken as a symbol for any bounded system and, by the same token, bodily orifices and fluids (blood, milk, urine, faeces, sweat and tears) stand for potential threats to the social collectivity, namely transgressions of the social order. This is because margins and borders are so problematic &#x2013; messy and untidy &#x2013; for societies. Reflections about purity and pollution are actually reflections about order and disorder, form and formlessness, being and nonbeing.<footnote label="12" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000269" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000270">Simon J.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000276">Sexual difference is not actually very important to Douglas, since although she recognizes that the perception of pollution &#x2013; especially clinging viscosity &#x2013; is linked to a rejection of the female body, as a natural symbol the body (and the difference between male and female bodies) only stands in for anxiety about other social divisions. In contrast, for French corporeal feminists and those whose work has developed within the frameworks they established, sexual difference is at the heart of the social distinction between clean and dirty. Fluids and &#x2018;leakiness&#x2019; are associated with femininity, the solid and concrete with the masculine.

Dirt created by or in the process of manly work is perceived to be cleaner than, for instance, bodily fluids, which are associated with the feminine. Moreover, one wonders whether car repair workers insist on maintaining their strikingly pragmatic attitude to cleaning up partly because of the absence of women workers in the body repair shop. Because there are no women working in the repair shops onto whom responsibility for dirt can be projected, exclusion of any hint of the potentially polluting, degrading connotations of (cleaning up) dirt may be essential to the maintenance of the shop&#x2019;s egalitarian, all male, comradely ethos.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000371">The example of debate on heterosexual prostitution is much more complicated, since &#x2018;dirtiness&#x2019; and disgust are invoked in many different ways. I suggest that while rejecting radical feminist views that seem to rest on the presumed purity of the female body, which is seen as defiled by involvement in commercial sex, we also need to question accounts that presume that the problem of prostitution will be resolved by rejecting discursive constructions of commercial sex as dirty or sordid.

This does not exclude consideration of, and may even highlight, sex workers&#x2019; risks of exposure to disease or violence and the variables that influence their ability to deploy strategies to resist them.</para>

Some 25 per cent have formal, legal relations with their employees, while 75 per cent have informal working ties. This means that they are not protected by any kind of legislation. Domestic servants, of all categories, are not a privilege of middle- and upper-income people. There are also lots of domestic workers among the working class and even among maids themselves. This type of servant is usually used as nanny for the young children of working-class mothers and maids when they go to work. They usually help with household tasks. There are no statistics on them.</para></footnote></para>

Maybe the reason, as Cox suggests, comes from the idea that although dirt is both omnipresent and largely absent, it is not explicitly assumed as an important element of domestic labour, an aspect that sets it apart from other jobs. As the same author emphasizes, &#x2018;We seldom think about dirt and cleanliness as being an aspect of social status in modern societies.&#x2019;<footnote label="13" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000418" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000419">Rosie Cox, &#x2018;What about the dirt in dirty work?

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000439">This general plan is customized in Brazil according to certain symbolic values that attribute different meanings and status to rooms and activities.

The third symbolic opposition is between the social and the service areas of the house. These three pairs of dualisms are important for understanding the symbolic geography of Brazilian homes. They are also key ingredients in comprehending the patterns and the logic of cleaning and its evaluation, the criteria of dirt and pollution that prevail in each room and how these criteria function in establishing boundaries, restricting behaviour and categorizing people.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000447" role="fullOut">The layout of Brazilian houses and apartments reveals the permanence of the distinction between employers and domestic workers. This can be perceived in the distinction that is always made between the &#x2018;social&#x2019; areas of the home &#x2013; those used by the employing family and where visitors can be received &#x2013; and the service areas where domestic workers live and work.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000448">The service area, located in the back of the house, was the most secluded part of a Brazilian home and always hidden from the eyes of visitors and strangers. It was the place of the servants, the space of low-status activities like cooking, laundering and cleaning and, until recently, it was given no aesthetic consideration. However, in the last few years all that has changed, particularly with regards to the kitchen, part of which moved from its hiding place at the back of the house to emerge brand new and exposed to visitors&#x2019; eyes. The kitchen has changed because of new meanings given to cooking and gastronomy, and through a general process of aesthetization undergone <?page value="29"?>by everyday life within Western society.<footnote label="19" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000449" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000450">Mike Featherstone, <emphasis role="italic">Cultura de consumo e p&#x00F3;s-modernidade</emphasis> (S&#x00E3;o Paulo: Nobel, 1996).</para></footnote> The changes to the kitchen have also extended to the utility area in terms of &#x2018;modernization&#x2019; and aestheticization.<footnote label="20" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000451" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000452">Buckets, brooms, pressing iron, soap and industrial cleaning products also received their share of aesthetic attention. New types of cabinets were developed with the function of hiding all the cleaning utensils. Ironing boards emerge as if by magic from closed doors and bucket, water basin and brushes now come in new colours that remind us of candy bars.</para></footnote></para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000453">The last part of the service area of the house is the maid&#x2019;s living quarters. This is the area that has undergone no qualitative or aesthetic change, except for the use of new construction materials that usually emphasize the pragmatic aspects of cleaning, such as tiles on the bedroom floor instead of wood parquet blocks. The servants&#x2019; living quarters are still the most secluded part of a Brazilian house. They are always kept away from the eyes of visitors and, although other members of the family will very seldom go to them, they are, from a certain perspective, public space, since no one who lives in the house has to ask permission to enter.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000454">The maid&#x2019;s room is usually very small, sometimes without any kind of window or proper ventilation and light. Servants often have to share this small space with other objects that have no place within the house or with things that still do not have their final destiny sealed. So, they might have to share their living space with vacuum cleaners, suitcases, old raincoats, boxes and pets. Their rooms are a mixture of storeroom and bedroom. This conjugation of people, animals and objects means that their rooms are their master&#x2019;s property and that the maids only sleep there. It is their space of intimacy, but not of privacy. The maids have no power to use the space as would best fit their taste or comfort.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000455">The servant&#x2019;s bathroom conditions are not very different from those in the bedroom. Usually the bathroom has a toilet, shower and sometimes a wash basin. In the absence of the latter (which is common), the maid has to wash her face and hands and brush her teeth in the sink located in the utility area, one of the most polluted and unclean spaces in the entire Brazilian house. The filth of the sink stems from all the impure activities that take place there. It is there where the floor mop is washed, where buckets of dirty water from cleaning the house are emptied, where the garbage can is washed on the days when the kitchen receives a good scrubbing, and where the dirt from cleaning utensils is removed every day. Even if it is white and shining bright, its everyday contact with filth makes it a permanently polluted artefact.<footnote label="21" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000456" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000457">Luis Dumont, <emphasis role="italic">Homo hierarchicus: o sistema de castas e suas implica&#x00E7;&#x00F5;es</emphasis>, translated by Carlos Alberto da Fonseca (S&#x00E3;o Paulo: Editora Universidade de S&#x00E3;o Paulo, 1992).</para></footnote></para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000458">Although most employers, when asked, would agree that these are poor living conditions that would seem inhuman for their own use, very few have plans to change them by redecorating the house. Changing the living conditions of maids is a low priority. One interviewee (a 50-year-old woman in <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000807"><primary>Rio de Janeiro</primary></indexterm>Rio de Janeiro) commented: &#x2018;Now my husband and I are planning to renovate the entire kitchen and the service area.

<?page value="30"?>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000459">Maids also have a clear idea of the poor material conditions of their living quarters compared with the rest of the house, although some say that they are much better than in their own houses in the slums, since they are not exposed to sewage or any other kind of dirt. &#x2018;If we compare it to the rest of the apartment, it is bad, but compared with a lot of places in the slums, it is not that bad&#x2019; (woman, 35 years old, <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000808"><primary>Rio de Janeiro</primary></indexterm>Rio de Janeiro).</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000460">This, however, does not necessarily mean that they prefer their living quarters in their employer&#x2019;s home. To own a house, in whatever condition, is to be protected &#x2018;from life&#x2019; and humiliation. There is a crucial difference between someone who is poor and someone who has &#x2018;a roof over my head that is mine&#x2019;. Besides being located at the far end of the service area several other physical and symbolic <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000120"><primary>boundaries</primary></indexterm>boundaries and limitations restrict servants&#x2019; movements inside Brazilian homes. For example, the maid&#x2019;s clothes are rarely washed with those of the other people in the house, and in some families maids are not even allowed to wash their clothes in the washing machine. The same is true of crockery, glasses and cutlery, for many employers keep specific sets just for the domestic workers.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000461">This clear material and physical separation does not mean that maids are considered intrinsically dirty. On the contrary, to be personally clean and to maintain high standards of <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000488"><primary>hybridity</primary><secondary>hygiene</secondary></indexterm>hygiene during the performance of household tasks are important criteria for hiring and keeping a person as a domestic servant. The opposite is also true. To be dirty, personally or at work, is a criterion for firing a maid. There is also no correlation between real dirt and the physical and material conditions of the living quarters of domestic workers. In fact, it is expected that they should be as clean as the rest of the house. So this separation does not have to do with the presence or absence of dirt itself, but with the idea of <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000746"><primary>pollution</primary></indexterm>pollution.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000465" role="fullOut">This attitude of avoiding mixing what belongs to the servants with what belongs to other people in the house is extended and made public in the case of the communal areas of apartment buildings; the existence of a specific &#x2018;service entrance&#x2019; and &#x2018;service elevators&#x2019; are other good examples of this. Officially, both should be used for cargo, commercial deliveries, people with pets and people sweating from physical exercise. However, in everyday life, both the service entrance and elevator are used by all maids working or living in the apartment buildings, as well as cargo and commercial deliveries. Owners with their pets and/or smelling of sweat from physical exercise use the social areas of the building without being challenged by the other owners, even when they consider such behaviour improper or disgusting. Cases of maids being withdrawn from social elevators are very common and, as far as I know, not a single one has had any legal consequence. The same clear <?page value="31"?>physical division between masters and servants applies to the leisure areas of apartment buildings. Servants are forbidden to use the swimming pools, sports areas or the keep-fit room. At most, they can sit on the benches outside the common areas.</para>

To avoid direct confrontation, which could sound like an inquisition to people who were amiably receiving me in their homes, I adopted a research methodology of posing problems and asking for their reactions. The first was how &#x2018;they&#x2019; would react if they found their maids taking a shower in their private bathroom. The second was why they would allow a stranger (a visitor or a guest) to use their private bathroom, yet the same situation would upset them if it concerned their maids. And the third question was about inviting &#x2018;new friends&#x2019; to their houses or swimming pools for entertainment, arguing that they would be total strangers in terms of hygiene habits. In the face of these questions/problems, some of the interviewees rose to a crescendo of irritability or irony against me. What lay behind their behaviour was the correct idea that my credentials to enquire about such practices were limited when I probably behaved the same way in my own house. However, after some stressful moments, people recognized that there was more to their attitude and to Brazilian attitudes in general towards the physical separation and material conditions of the living quarters of domestic servants, than we usually want to admit or understand.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000470">There were several different lines of arguments offered by interviewees to explain why they kept these strict separations.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000480">When I asked employers why they would not wash their clothes in the washing machine together with their maid&#x2019;s clothes, which would save electricity, water and soap, those keener on economic reasons reacted with perplexity. And even more so when I pointed out to them that they probably <?page value="32"?>would not separate a guest&#x2019;s or visitor&#x2019;s clothes so rigidly, although I was sure that they would not know their hygiene habits either, or whom they deal or live with. The same was true of crockery, glasses, knives and forks. Although they also would not know the habits and acquaintances of their guests and visitors, they would give them their best.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000481">Some of these arguments would also apply to other categories of people, such as total strangers about whom they knew nothing at all. However, it is difficult to justify any of them as they are all easily forgotten when the maids share the intimacy of everyday family life, washing, cleaning and cooking for the whole family. Besides, many domestic workers live and work in a single house for many years, which allows for a great deal of mutual knowledge about their personal habits and families to develop.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000482">It is important to note the independence of the explanations given for the physical division and material conditions of the living quarters of the maids and the size of the house or apartment, the income, the intellectual capital and the political ideology of the family.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000483">Another important point to mention is the feeling of disgust that some maids expressed about certain of their employers&#x2019; habits. Women were the main targets of the domestic servants in terms of their personal hygiene and also some of their cooking or cleaning practices.

They were also very critical of other maids&#x2019; cleaning standards and performance at work. However, some would agree that it was better for things to be separated since they would not feel at ease if they had to participate intimately in the family&#x2019;s life. This does not mean that the domestic servants in <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000161"><primary>Brazil</primary></indexterm>Brazil do not feel humiliated or that they are not conscious of the distance between them and the rest of the household. A good employer is a considerate one who treats them equally. What appears to be important is not the physical separation inside the house, but the interpersonal treatment received from employers, including their understanding of personal difficulties and hardships, and the granting of all legal and labour rights. What is central here is the possibility that pollution criteria are so ingrained in Brazilian life that they have became a structural aspect of life for all social groups.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000487" role="fullOut">In two previous works I have argued that Brazilian practices of washing clothes, house cleaning and personal hygiene revolve around the idea of pollution in opposition to a practical, economic or &#x2018;efficient&#x2019; criteria that prevailed predominantly in the USA and UK. This criterion of pollution could be seen in the innumerable classificatory categories of clothes that can <?page value="33"?>and cannot be washed together, in the storage of cleaning utensils, in personal hygiene practices and in many other aspects of daily life, as well as in symbolic representations of what is and what is not disgusting.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000488">The theoretical point made at that time was that the idea of pollution in modern society was alive and well. This point was in contrast to much of the literature that considers pollution mainly in relation to traditional societies, <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000801"><primary>religion</primary></indexterm>religion or the working classes in modern societies. Here I believe that I have demonstrated that pollution is not only alive and well and that, at least in <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000162"><primary>Brazil</primary></indexterm>Brazil, pollution is a criterion that concurs with others in organizing the social life of our society in certain spaces and contexts, a criterion that is used regardless of political ideology and level of education.<footnote label="22" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000489" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000490">When visiting the poor areas of Brazil during election time, the candidates always try to eat among people. The point behind this kind of behaviour is explicitly to show that they do not feel any disgust for them or their food. The importance of demonstrating that, as a politician and an important person, he or she does not entertain that kind of feeling lies in the fact that not to feel disgust for others is a demonstration of an egalitarian ideology. The same is true of the practice of letting people kiss you or holding poor infants in their laps. See Roberto Pompeu Loureiro, &#x2018;Dos pasties a poltrona de couro&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Veja</emphasis>, 8 November 2006.</para></footnote></para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000491">What supports this criterion of pollution, particularly in the context of the relationship between employers and domestic workers are two different notions. First, there is a work ethic that historically devalues all manual and freelance work and values the social origin and stability of a person&#x2019;s income more than the individual capacity to earn a living. Second, there is an idea of pollution that combines feelings related to social contamination and fear of invasion of intimacy of one&#x2019;s own group that is not necessarily linked to dirt. Brazilian social hierarchy is then characterized by a combination of the physical proximity of people of different social origins at the same time as existential distance.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000492">This leads to a possible different answer to the problem proposed by <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000311"><primary>Douglas, Mary</primary></indexterm>Douglas,<footnote label="23" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000493" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000494">Mary Douglas, <emphasis role="italic">Implicit Meaning: Essays in Anthropology by Mary Douglas</emphasis> (London: Routledge &#x0026; Kegan Paul, 1975).</para></footnote> when she compared Indian and Western societies and asked which system of stratification is the more ruthless in exploiting human beings &#x2013; one based on wealth and authority or one based on a system of purity rules? The answer is that they are not mutually exclusive. The tragic fact is that they can combine, as in the Brazilian case, to make the lives of the people at the base of social hierarchies even harder than they would otherwise be.</para>

Arguments that important social transformations are taking place frequently come with a note of criticism that the proclaimed changes are for the worse. There are intimations that because contemporary cleaning practices are deregulated, they lack the necessary routine and skill to make &#x2018;a good job of it&#x2019;.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000510">In examining claims of domestic deregulation, I draw on recently completed ethnographic research on cleaning and ordering practices in the kitchens of 12 households, diverse in terms of their life cycle stage and composition (see Table 3.1 for further details). Our research involved households in a variety of visual data generation methods, including CCTV recording, and qualitative interviewing to investigate sentiments around and representations of kitchen cleanliness.<footnote label="5" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000511" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000512">The ESRC funded the project, <emphasis role="italic">Domestic Kitchen Practices</emphasis>, and I thank the council for its financial support (RES&#x2013;000&#x2013;22&#x2013;0014). Other members of the research team were Professor Sue Scott (co-applicant) and Dr Matt Watson (research associate) and I am very grateful to them for their input into this project. For a detailed discussion of the methodology of this project, please refer to the ESRC&#x2019;s end of award report (Lydia Martens and Sue Scott, &#x2018;Domestic kitchen practices: routines, risks and reflexivity &#x2013; end of award report&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Economic and Social Research Council</emphasis>, Swindon (UK), 2004, pp. 1&#x2013;28).</para></footnote> My argument develops in two stages. I start by considering the notion of cleaning routines, as it was in relation to this concept that our practitioners voiced their awareness of, and response to a traditional understanding of domestic cleaning, which I unearth by interweaving the existing academic literature on the modern history of cleanliness with discourses on cleanliness found in the <emphasis role="italic">Good Housekeeping</emphasis> magazine in the early postwar years. In the second part, I argue that this traditional understanding is accompanied by another understanding for organizing domestic cleaning, and this is a method that relies on the visual monitoring of domestic material culture. I will discuss the consequences of a move towards such aesthetic concerns for claims about the (de)regulation of cleaning practices and the place of invisible dirt, like germs, in the hierarchy of cleaning priorities.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000518" role="fullOut">The participants in our study discussed a series of kitchen related practices with us that included dish washing, cleaning the kitchen infrastructure and ordering its material culture, food related practices (including eating), shopping and other more miscellaneous practices. Participants talked about what they cleaned in the kitchen, what their priorities were and also about when and how cleaning activities were done. Part of the reason for generating ethnographic material through CCTV footage was our interest in routines in the kitchen. In the Findley household, doing the dishes, cleaning kitchen surfaces and the table, dusting the Rayburn,<footnote label="6" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000519" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000520">The Rayburn is a brand name for a traditional type stove that offered all-in-one facilities for cooking, baking, water and house heating.

These were contrasted with other cleaning tasks that were deemed important, but that would be done less frequently, like vacuum and wet cleaning the tiled floor, washing the kitchen doors, cupboards, walls and ceiling (because the Rayburn deposited a continuous layer of dust on everything) and cleaning the kitchen window. Additional daily tasks that are clearly not so much part of the discursive consciousness can be witnessed in the CCTV footage. These included setting and clearing the table, organizing the dishes waiting to be cleaned, and a variety of ordering practices.

The Findleys argued for instance that routines were prominently present in their kitchen and that this was not regarded as a problem. Quite the contrary! Routines were positively welcomed and adhered to, and this seemed to provide a sense of trust in their own practices. Anticipating the CCTV&#x2019;s presence in their kitchen, Mandy commented: &#x2018;We are always saying that, &#x201C;oh we are so disorganized, we ought to have more routine,&#x201D; but you will probably find that we have got loads [laughs].&#x2019; In contrast to the Findleys, some of our domestic practitioners asserted that they did not have a cleaning routine, providing early support for the notion that cleaning has become deregulated in at least some contemporary households. Sarah Allison provided the strongest denial of adherence to any sort of cleaning routine. This presented us with a conundrum, as CCTV footage of her kitchen activities clearly indicated the presence of routines. What exactly was she telling us with her denial?</para>

This move may be seen as a consequence of the <emphasis role="italic">invisibility</emphasis> of germs. In a context where practitioners could not know that germs had been effectively eradicated, this priority merged and fused in complex ways with a specific domestic aesthetic of shiny, white, sparkling and pleasantly smelling interiors that was promoted in the pages of the <emphasis role="italic">Good Housekeeping</emphasis> magazine at this time. The priority of appearance in cleaning came forth from a complex mixture of cultural concerns that preceded germ consciousness.<footnote label="11" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000657" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000658">It could be argued that scholars have been primarily interested in this factor of domestic cleanliness, as the whiteness, brightness and sparkle induced by cleaning has been connected with &#x2018;othering&#x2019; practices. This has been the focus of some interesting work on the symbolic meanings of cleanliness. See for example Anders Linde-Laursen, &#x2018;The nationalization of trivialities: how cleaning becomes an identity marker in the encounter of Swedes and Danes&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Ethnos</emphasis>, vol. 58, nos 3&#x2013;4, 1993, p. 275; and Lisa Saugeres, &#x2018;Of tidy gardens and clean houses: housing officers as agents of social control&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Geoforum</emphasis>, vol. 31, no. 4, 2000, pp. 587&#x2013;599, which theoretically come close to Mary Douglas&#x2019;s theory on the role of purity and danger in the construction of culture (Mary Douglas, <emphasis role="italic">Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo</emphasis>, London: Routledge &#x0026; Kegan Paul, 1966). In this chapter, I do not really address this perspective in preference for a focus on the cultural meanings of cleanliness practices associated with domestic cultures.</para></footnote> In addition to the argument just made, it tapped into concerns about status and respectability, ideas about fashion and the trend towards modern d&#x00E9;cor as well as a desire to make the home a welcoming and cosy place to be.<footnote label="12" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000659" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000660">A reading of Tomes, <emphasis role="italic">The Gospel of Germs</emphasis>, suggests that aesthetic concerns were the focus of cleanliness in Victorian households before germ consciousness spread, and she identifies this with status struggles.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000697">Contemporary households with young children indicated how they are subject to two opposing priorities &#x2013; the cultural imperative to maintain a high standard of cleanliness and the importance of having time to spend with young children. This shows an interesting contemporary contradiction because, in advice given to families with young children, cleanliness is often stressed, especially through the recommendation to sterilize the equipment for the baby.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000701" role="fullOut">From our discussions it was apparent that a variety of situations and conditions triggered the urge to clean. The expected arrival of a stranger or a guest (including members of the research team) was for some a reason to clean. The presence of children and pets was a reason for more frequent cleaning and ordering, and indicated an implicit link to germ awareness and knowledge. For others, the decision to clean was associated with the arrival of specific times of the year, like Christmas and spring, suggesting that there is some adherence to traditional notions of <emphasis role="italic">when</emphasis> it is appropriate to clean. The degree to which the domestic environment had been shaped by the domestic practitioner and to what extent they regarded this as part of their &#x2018;self&#x2019; formed a further dimension related to the urge to clean.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000738">The Crammonds had wanted laminate flooring before they moved into their current home because of its aesthetic appeal. Yet, living with it in the context of the realities of their everyday lives, their wish had quickly turned to disappointment, for their flooring hardly ever adhered to the pleasing aesthetics it had promised. The couple was now discussing replacing it with carpets. What seemed interesting here was their acknowledgement that carpets were easier to live with because, by harbouring dirt, they also obscured it, thereby ameliorating the need to clean as frequently. This was tentatively seen as a problem for kitchen flooring, but not for other areas of the ground floor.<footnote label="20" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000739" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000740">Other participants also felt carpets were inappropriate floor cover for a kitchen.</para></footnote> What is clear, however, is that participants were thinking creatively about how the material culture of their homes fitted into their everyday lives, and that when they indicated &#x2018;problem&#x2019; areas, this was often with a view to making changes if possible.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000757">Another way in which the prominence of the visual in contemporary cleanliness came to the fore was in relation to <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000410"><primary>germs</primary></indexterm>germs. In a cleaning culture where sensory stimuli are important, invisible and odourless &#x2018;entities&#x2019; like germs may easily slip down the hierarchy of domestic priorities. On the other hand, it may be argued that because &#x2018;they&#x2019; are invisible, germ anxieties are more potent &#x2013; after all, given that they cannot be seen, the domestic practitioner does not know whether there are harmful germs in their environment and whether their cleaning activities successfully remove them. Nevertheless, it is clear that health educationists and marketers eager to proclaim the salience of germs have resorted to media campaigns in which germs are made visible, which some of our participants, like <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000367"><primary>Findley, Sally</primary></indexterm>Sally Findley and <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000611"><primary>Lowe, Mary</primary></indexterm>Mary Lowe, accounted as having made them more keenly aware of germs.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000758">Notwithstanding these concerns, our research showed clearly that domestic aesthetics did not always win it over germ consciousness. Interestingly, in some households, where cleaning had been relegated to the lower ranks of the domestic priority task list, there was a concomitant reorganization of the priority placed on germs and aesthetics. Health educationists will be pleased to hear that in our discussions with Janice and Josie, both working mothers with very young children, cleaning to counter germs remained of significant importance, with the maintenance of an ordered appearance relegated to second place:</para>

They then spoke about how Simon&#x2019;s mum found this practice hard to accept. The shift to leaving dishes to dry may also tap into the priority of making cleaning less time consuming and therefore easier, and it may in fact have been this that irked Simon&#x2019;s mother most.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000771">While model one embodies the late modern desire for &#x2018;being in control&#x2019;, model two symbolizes &#x2018;lapse of control&#x2019;. Even so, these models embodied another late modern ethos that reflects on the self, and this is the disjuncture between being too strict and uptight as opposed to being relaxed in one&#x2019;s everyday life and practice.

Others, on the other hand, simply did not think cleaning was important enough to dictate their activities. The Lowes were a case in point, indicating that here, too, cleaning was stimulated by reaching a level beyond which &#x2018;things&#x2019; became impossible, and action had to be undertaken.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000790" role="fullOut">The claim that domestic life has become deregulated is in need of critical appraisal. Within it resides the idea that there has been a shift from regulation towards deregulation, and that this change is for the worse: that, as <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000470"><primary>Hoy, Suellen</primary></indexterm>Hoy suggested, homes are now sadly dirtier than they used to be.<footnote label="21" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000791" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000792">Hoy, <emphasis role="italic">Chasing Dirt</emphasis>.</para></footnote> In this chapter, I have argued that the remnants of a now somewhat outdated cultural understanding of domestic <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000208"><primary>cleanliness</primary></indexterm>cleanliness, which connects high standards to a specific temporal ordering of cleaning work, still exists, and that this needs to be seen as the model of cleanliness that approximates the notion of regulated domestic activity. There was evidence in our research that this culture impacted on the thinking patterns of some of our respondents. Indeed, through expressions of dissatisfaction with existing practices, some domestic practitioners worried about the absence of routine in their practices, while others indicated that their household&#x2019;s visual cleanliness moved frequently beyond their own tolerance levels.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000793">The prominence of visual monitoring of cleanliness in the domestic sphere could also be taken as evidence that cleaning is deregulated. After all, it suggests that the decision to clean is based more on &#x2018;how things look&#x2019; than on &#x2018;the time has arrived to do it&#x2019;. In addition, the idea that contemporary households are dirtier than they used to be suggests that the traditional culture of cleanliness, with its temporal routines, is more effective in keeping the domestic sphere clean than practices that result from visual monitoring. Yet, adhering to a temporal routine of cleaning may not necessarily result in &#x2018;the best&#x2019; cleanliness. The example of kitchen floor cleaning discussed above suggests that when contemporary cleanliness is connected with visual monitoring, cleaning practices may become more rather than less frequent as practitioners chase the dirt that is visible in their homes; indicating that there is perhaps less cultural tolerance of visible dirt in today&#x2019;s society than there was in the past.</para>
<?page value="48"?>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000794">In some respects, it is hardly surprising that the visual plays such an important role in stimulating cleaning practices in today&#x2019;s households. The prominence of the visual in late <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000657"><primary>modernity</primary></indexterm>modernity is not specific to domestic cleanliness practices, but finds an extension in other contemporary practices and preferences, such as fashion and the desire for aesthetically pleasing objects.<footnote label="22" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000795" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000796">Mike Featherstone, <emphasis role="italic">Consumer Culture and Postmodernism</emphasis> (London: Sage, 1991); Celia Lury, <emphasis role="italic">Consumer Culture</emphasis> (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1996).</para></footnote> In this sense, the visual adds to our sense of civility and symbolizes more generally a shift towards a &#x2018;cleaner&#x2019; and visually pleasing everyday environment. It is probable, too, that because of interior design changes during the twentieth century, the home has become &#x2018;better&#x2019; at showing up dirt, while at the same time offering inventions that reduce the presence of traditional forms of dirt, like soot from solid fuel stoves. It was clear that some domestic materials were more &#x2018;effective&#x2019; at communicating &#x2018;dirt&#x2019; to the domestic practitioner than others. While products like the Dyson vacuum cleaner are sold as modern inventions that clearly &#x2018;show&#x2019; dirt, it is clear from the discussion of the diverse qualities of floor covering in this study that household objects that obscure dirt may be welcomed precisely because they diminish the urge to clean. The relationship between visible and invisible dimensions of dirt in cultures of contemporary cleanliness no doubt warrants more attention than I have managed to give it here, for one because it connects in interesting ways with the <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000121"><primary>boundaries</primary></indexterm>boundaries domestic practitioners create around aspects of the home about which they are and wish to be aware and those of which they wish to remain ignorant.<footnote label="23" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000797" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000798">For an interesting take on the invisible dimensions of the home, see Maria Ka&#x00EF;ka, &#x2018;Interrogating the geographies of the familiar: domesticating nature and constructing the autonomy of the modern home&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">International Journal of Urban and Regional Research</emphasis>, vol. 28, no. 2, 2004, pp. 265&#x2013;86.</para></footnote> Germs may rightly be seen to pose a problem in relation to this because, through their invisibility, they may be the easiest form of dirt to ignore and de-prioritize. Our evidence suggests, however, that in those households where it is said to matter most, germ dangers gain priority over visible and perhaps more innocent forms of dirt.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000799">A shift towards the visual monitoring of dirt in the home may be a direct consequence of the decline in the temporal ordering of cleaning practices. If an organization along specific temporal routines is rejected, perhaps because other household priorities do not allow them to be organized in that way, domestic practitioners need to have a means of judging when it is time to clean what. By &#x2018;showing&#x2019; dirt, household objects and surfaces more or less effectively communicate with the practitioner when it is time to clean. Lastly, the diversity of households included in this small ethnographic study nevertheless shows that opportunities and constraints for &#x2018;filling in&#x2019; everyday life vary significantly. Given this diversity it would be strange to find that cleaning was regulated in a sense that everyone followed the same temporal and practice routines. In fact, we should expect to find that practices vary between households, but this is not the same as arguing that routines do not exist in people&#x2019;s practices, or that today&#x2019;s households are necessarily dirty.</para>

Important information about the funeral and grief process will be laid out neatly on a small table. This need to present a clutter free space where everything is systematically arranged helps present a professional image to the bereaved. This is further highlighted by a funeral director who is not only stylish in his or her manner, but also well groomed.</para>

This manoeuvring of the bereaved bodies is achieved through statements such as &#x2018;please follow me&#x2019; or &#x2018;this way please&#x2019;. Funeral directors <?page value="57"?>will also place their body between mourners and doors they identify as being off limits to the living. In this way a funeral director politely manages and manoeuvres the bodies of the living around the funeral home, ensuring that the borders between the public and private spaces of the home are reinforced. On each and every occasion that the bereaved and the funeral director meet, these separations will be reiterated and re-enacted, ensuring that the overall process of the funeral is conducted &#x2018;without incident&#x2019;.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000930">As I have mentioned, the dead do not enter the funeral home via the front door. On arrival the deceased&#x2019;s body is driven directly to the rear of the funeral home, where it is immediately removed from the hearse and taken without delay to the mortuary (see <link linkend="b-9780755694235-fig4.3" role="figure">Figure 4.3</link>). The transferring of the deceased&#x2019;s body from the hearse to the mortuary must be undertaken in such a way as to ensure the dignity and respect of the deceased. This transferral must also be accomplished to prevent the general public or visiting mourners accidentally viewing an unprepared corpse.<footnote label="32" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000931" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000932">Strub and Fredrick, <emphasis role="italic">The Principles and Practices of Embalming.</emphasis></para></footnote> It is for this reason that the mortuary is located at the rear of the funeral home (see <link role="figure" linkend="b-9780755694235-fig4.3">Figure 4.3</link>).</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000933">To ensure the separateness of the mortuary, it is deemed off limits to all but those directly qualified to work with the corpse. This separation of the mortuary from the public space at the front of the funeral home is upheld through a variety of health and safety regulations. However, the most important separation technique comes about through the construction of the corpse as a contagious object. As I have suggested, the funeral industry holds that no matter what type of death has occurred, all corpses are polluting dangerous objects. Therefore, within the hidden space of the embalmer&#x2019;s room the most abject of human fear exists, the decomposing corpse. This liminal zone and the decaying bodies that occupy it are, for many outside the funeral industry, an uncomfortable, unspeakable and mystifying space. It is here that the material and nonmaterial worlds are socially and historically constructed, simultaneously engaged, regulated and disciplined. Notions of the sacred and profane are negotiated and contained.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000937" role="fullOut">To ensure that the borders between the living and the dead are enforced I have suggested that the funeral home is separated into public and private spaces. To guarantee this separation, funeral directors close doors between these two spaces. However, the mere closing of doors will not ensure that these borders remain intact. Therefore it is necessary for the funeral director to draw on various notions of correct behaviour or funeral etiquette, so as to create an atmosphere within which certain behaviour is performed.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000938">Another way of ensuring that the borders between the public and private, clean and unclean, are separate is to create a well ordered public space. Some homes draw on a bygone era, using the d&#x00E9;cor of old Victorian homes.

Most importantly though, presenting the bereaved with Victorian style d&#x00E9;cor creates solidity, which gives a degree of security embedded in what has come to be understood as representing &#x2018;old fashioned&#x2019; values.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000941">While some homes prefer to create a more modern environment, similar to that found in Beauchamp&#x2019;s Funeral Home (<link role="figure" linkend="b-9780755694235-fig4.2">Figure 4.2</link>), which replicates an early 1970s living room, the rooms, whether old or new, will be simple and uncluttered, comparable with that of a more middle-class living room.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000942">Although it is necessary for the funeral director to create a homely atmosphere, which helps place the bereaved at ease, they do not want to create an eerie illusion.

For this reason funeral items will be discreetly placed around the room.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000943">As I have previously suggested, the nineteenth century saw concepts about cleanliness become embedded in middle-class practices of refinement, which in turn were replicated in people&#x2019;s homes.

The ordered environment allows the bereaved to come back from the brink of the disorder that death has brought to their lives.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000946">Until this moment the corpse has been segregated or stored in an adjoining corridor or holding room. The storage space lies behind the kitchen and beside the main viewing area. While this may appear to be contradictory in practice, housing the dead within close proximity of the kitchen is viewed as safe by those working in the funeral industry because the body has been thoroughly embalmed. Once embalmed and coffined the corpse is no longer considered a polluting object. It is at this point that the deceased can enter the public space of the funeral home. With its borders reconstituted and the signs of death eradicated, the corpse is no longer considered dangerous to the living. It is now at home with the living.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000950" role="fullOut">In this chapter I set out to examine how the establishment of the funeral &#x2018;home&#x2019; and its association with purification and filth has led to contemporary funeral homes becoming necessary, yet marginal spaces. In Western societies, much of what has come to be understood about the disposal of the dead, and the need for funerals, has been constructed through varying discourses within the funeral industry. These discourses are, in turn, performed through <?page value="59"?><indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000213"><primary>cleanliness</primary></indexterm>the bodies of the living and the dead, within what have come to be known as funeral homes. By drawing on middle-class notions of home, and merging this with medical discourses around contagion and sanitation, the funeral home has come to offer mourners a sanitized and safer version of death, and a space within which to engage with death. However, the need for this space to be more than merely a business space means that the funeral director has to draw on notions of the home to minimize the harsh reality of death.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000951">In tracing the movements of both the living and the dead through the funeral home and exploring various regulatory acts that contain and construct the private and public spaces of the funeral home, I have begun to highlight the borders between life and death, inside and outside, home and homelessness, and purity and filth as played out in this deathscape. In doing so, I have revealed the inseparability of the construction of the sanitized funeral &#x2018;home&#x2019; and the discourse of the &#x2018;diseased&#x2019; dead.</para>

This question requires a broader discussion of the usefulness of &#x2018;dirt&#x2019; as a concept and analytical category. In contemporary urban visual culture and aesthetics, dirt is simultaneously celebrated as &#x2018;chic&#x2019;, and used as an index of socio-political breakdown, poverty and inequality. A nuanced and politically engaged approach to analysis is therefore required.

Contemporary &#x2018;spaces of abjection&#x2019; cannot be discussed in such clear-cut terms. Instead, a more fluid conception of urban boundaries, and of our attitudes towards dirt and &#x2018;dirty&#x2019; places, is required. How do we account, for example, for the juxtaposition of different high/low class land uses side by side, for the new domestic, cultural and commercial uses of buildings and spaces formerly associated with and tainted or polluted by industry, or for the attractions of &#x2018;edgy&#x2019; urban neighbourhoods?</para>

His clean graffiti is interesting because, through method and media, it confuses the categories of &#x2018;clean&#x2019; and &#x2018;dirty&#x2019; in an unsettling way. Graffiti is often read as damage and as a sign of urban neglect: Moose&#x2019;s carefully inscribed writing, adopting the visual rhetoric of graffiti, highlights the filth around it. Given the artist&#x2019;s employment in other projects by large multinationals for advertising campaigns, his work seems contradictory in both celebrating urban grime and participating in corporate urban sanitization. It simultaneously highlights public space as &#x2018;public&#x2019;, echoing the rebellious acts of graffiti artists, often presented as <?page value="76"?>destructive vandals (&#x2018;they cannot complain if all we do is clean&#x2019;), while also explicitly (and subliminally) communicating corporate advertising motifs on publicly owned and maintained urban infrastructures.

These feelings are simultaneously social, bodily and spatial. &#x2026; In abjection, senses of revulsion over bodily materials and feelings are established. The subject wants to expel whatever is reviled, but is powerless to achieve it: thus, for example, the desire to be completely clean all the time cannot be achieved, purity cannot be maintained.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001280" role="fullOut">Like many English suburbs, Eastside is an architectural and social hybrid encompassing a traditional rural village, a sprawling modernist postwar council housing estate, plus a series of newer private housing developments. Londoners have moved to Eastside over several decades, first into council housing but increasingly into owner occupation. As such, Eastside represents an ideal location to consider how residential preferences link with place images and social distinctions, not only in relation to the London the Eastsiders had left behind but also in relation to their new suburban neighbourhood. The research employed both a survey and semi-structured interviews and focused on those residents, mainly homeowners, who had moved from an address within the Greater London boundary to Eastside during the previous ten-year period.<footnote label="35" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001281" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001282">The survey involving 140 residents was undertaken during 2004. A sub-sample of survey respondents was followed up and 42 semi-structured interviews were carried out in 2004&#x2013;5. The project was funded by the British Academy, grant LRG&#x2013;35374.</para></footnote></para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001283">The survey respondents were &#x2018;typically suburban&#x2019; in the sense that they were predominantly white, middle-aged, married or cohabiting heterosexual couples. At the same time, there was also greater social diversity than this suburban stereotype might suggest, with a significant minority of divorced and single people as well as a small percentage from non-white ethnic backgrounds. In terms of social class, the survey sample can be divided into two, broadly reflecting class differences. Over half lived in a large new private estate given the name &#x2018;Woodlands&#x2019;, described by local estate agents as a &#x2018;prestigious&#x2019; location, somewhat set apart from the rest of Eastside with a distinctive rural feel. The Woodlands estate is dominated by the managerial and professional middle classes living in detached and semi-detached houses, although a few manual workers, such as taxi drivers, were also present. The other part of the survey sample lived in several private housing developments, including flats as well as houses, given the collective name &#x2018;Newtown estates&#x2019;. These are scattered both adjacent to and among the council housing estate that dominates Eastside. The Newtown residents were more working class than their Woodlands&#x2019; counterparts, but even then managers and professionals still accounted for a quarter of the Newtown sample.</para>

Housing, in terms of relative affordability, size and quality, was extremely important, while personal issues (for example getting married or divorced) were also significant. Area also played a role for most respondents as they described wanting to live in a &#x2018;better&#x2019; or &#x2018;nicer&#x2019; neighbourhood, while some also wanted &#x2018;better schools&#x2019; for their children.

Negative assessments of noise, smell, congestion, lack of space and the general appearance of the physical environment were prominent.

There was high crime and vandalism, drugs on the doorstep.&#x2019;</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001294">To understand the significance of urban place images and the intertwining of physical dirt with social disorder, we must introduce a temporal as well as spatial dimension into the analysis. Place images are not fixed but can change their meaning over time. The &#x2018;same&#x2019; place can thus engender very different meanings depending on whether the present or the past is being described, while images of the present can gain their meaning from how the past is <emphasis role="italic">remembered</emphasis> to have existed. Such remembered images can be extremely powerful since they draw upon nostalgic yearnings for times gone by that can reverberate back to childhood.<footnote label="38" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001295" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001296">In <emphasis role="italic">Tales of the City</emphasis> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998) pp. 153&#x2013;64, Ruth Finnegan is sceptical about whether any claims to a past &#x2018;community&#x2019; have credence given their nostalgic mythical content.</para></footnote></para>

Such narratives of urban decline were prominent in accounts of working-class neighbourhoods, but also <?page value="86"?>featured in relation to some middle-class areas.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001330" role="fullOut">What did the suburban in-movers think about Eastside once they had moved there? Most were very satisfied with their housing and to a somewhat lesser extent with their neighbourhoods. Eastside was routinely described as &#x2018;quiet&#x2019;, <?page value="88"?>&#x2018;peaceful&#x2019;, &#x2018;convenient&#x2019; and close to the countryside, as well as &#x2018;clean&#x2019; or &#x2018;cleaner&#x2019;, indicating the power of the suburban purity image. In fact, one-quarter of the survey respondents could think of nothing they disliked about living in the area. In many ways a benign picture can be painted of suburban order, <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000224"><primary>cleanliness</primary></indexterm>cleanliness and tranquillity as opposed to the urban disorder, dirt and ever present risk they had left behind in London, and especially for those who had moved from east London, apart from <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000445"><primary>Havering</primary></indexterm>Havering.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001331">Despite this image of suburban purity and order, there was also evidence of either overt or more submerged disquiet. Some of this related to inadequate infrastructure, notably the paucity of public transport and limited shopping and leisure facilities. However, much of the disquiet centred on the perceived qualities of the Eastside area and the way it contained more dirty, disorderly urban elements than many residents would have ideally liked. Rather than Eastside being uniformly uncontaminated and &#x2018;clean&#x2019;, it would be more accurate instead to describe it as a &#x2018;spoiled suburb&#x2019;.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001332">In both the survey and interviews, respondents frequently qualified their more positive <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000738"><primary>place images</primary></indexterm>place images about &#x2018;the area&#x2019; by making a spatial distinction between their more immediate neighbourhood and the rest of Eastside. Such qualificatory statements were especially prominent among people who lived in the Woodlands estate: &#x2018;it&#x2019;s the [Eastside] area I don&#x2019;t like; Woodlands estate is quiet and peaceful&#x2019; (S.104). The middle-class Woodlands residents routinely described their estate as an &#x2018;oasis&#x2019;, one that was located within an otherwise urban desert that had managed to replicate, albeit to a lesser degree, the inner-city dirt and disorderliness they had fled London to avoid in the first place. The blots on the Eastside suburban landscape included the council estate, the state schools, the local shops and pubs, as well as nearby travellers&#x2019; sites. To a greater or lesser extent, these were stigmatized polluted places to avoid. The large council estate in particular was associated with various combinations of crime, antisocial behaviour and poverty, as well as constituting a form of physical <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000754"><primary>pollution</primary></indexterm>pollution: &#x2018;the [council] housing estate in Eastside is an eyesore&#x2019; (S.19). The neighbourhood shops and pubs were often described as &#x2018;tatty&#x2019; and &#x2018;rough&#x2019; places to avoid.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001333">Some ex-Londoners had moved to Eastside to get a &#x2018;better&#x2019; education for their children by escaping inner-city schools. While several expressed satisfaction with the education provision in their new area, others included the local schools in their list of area dislikes. Negative comments about the state schools were more pronounced among the residents of Woodlands than among their Newtown counterparts. The semi-structured interviews revealed the depth of dissatisfaction with the local schools plus the various strategies that parents engaged in both to gain information and to prevent their children going to such schools.<footnote label="45" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001334" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001335">Ball, <emphasis role="italic">Class Strategies and the Education Market.</emphasis></para></footnote> The middle-class parents living in the Woodlands estate tended to send their children outside the Eastside area, <?page value="89"?>either elsewhere in <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000359"><primary>Essex</primary></indexterm>Essex or to affluent suburban areas in London. One Woodlands mother (Lesley) explained her neighbour&#x2019;s &#x2018;disgusted&#x2019; reaction to the local schools:</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001338">While Lesley was very concerned not to appear &#x2018;snobbish&#x2019;, at the same time she expressed distaste for the &#x2018;dirty&#x2019; elements associated with the local schools, both physical (&#x2018;filthy classrooms&#x2019;) and social (&#x2018;unruly children&#x2019;). The local schools did not live up to her or other Woodlands parents&#x2019; educational expectations, expectations bound up with a moral order that was threatened by signs of dirt. These signs also had racialized connotations in relation to those children who came from another blot on the suburban landscape, namely travellers&#x2019; camp sites of which there are many in Essex. Rather than truly escaping the &#x2018;roughs and toughs&#x2019; found in inner-city schools,<footnote label="46" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001339" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001340">Diane Reay, &#x2018;Mostly roughs and toughs: social class, race and representation in inner city schooling&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Sociology</emphasis>, vol. 38, 2004, pp. 1005&#x2013;23.</para></footnote> the middle-class parents simply encountered different versions of these same polluting others.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001341">As well as pre-existing sites of dirt and disorder, the Eastside residents also expressed concern about polluting &#x2018;flows&#x2019;, not least the drift of ex-city dwellers ironically making the selfsame move as the interviewees.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001344">Similarly, Barbara, who was in her sixties, commented on how moving from <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000697"><primary>Newham</primary></indexterm>Newham meant that she could now mix with a &#x2018;better class&#x2019; of person, and at the same time &#x2018;it doesn&#x2019;t feel so dirty to me here&#x2019;. However, she thought that polluting urban elements were beginning to make their appearance felt in Eastside and that this was precipitating a change in the area:</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001351" role="fullOut">Most of the ex-Londoners regarded their move out to Eastside positively. They had secured either a first or a better step on the property ladder and were pleased with their homes. They were somewhat less pleased with the Eastside area, although those who had moved from east London, with the exception of those from <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000446"><primary>Havering</primary></indexterm>Havering, generally considered it an improvement. They had successfully left behind the dirty, disorderly city, one in which previous neighbourhood-based communities had dissolved. Abjection, feelings of anxiety and disgust, were expressed in relation to these narratives of urban decline as the pure imagined community of the past had been penetrated and overwhelmed by a gamut of polluting &#x2018;others&#x2019; (like youths, tenants and <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000506"><primary>immigrants</primary></indexterm>immigrants).

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001352">Eastside&#x2019;s purity, however, was partial. There were too many blots on the suburban landscape such as the council estate. The latter was the product of an earlier round of state driven housing investment, built to accommodate the postwar Fordist working class, but one that more recent home-owning newcomers felt threatened their real or aspirational sense of class exclusivity. Although a significant proportion of the Eastside interviewees were working <?page value="91"?>class in occupational terms, home ownership acted as a significant <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000198"><primary>Clapson, Mark</primary></indexterm>marker of social distinction in consumption terms, as is typically the case in <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000346"><primary>England</primary></indexterm>England.<footnote label="47" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001353" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001354">Clapson, <emphasis role="italic">Suburban Century</emphasis>.</para></footnote> In addition, several Eastsiders, particularly the middle-class Woodlands residents, held negative views about the local schools. Racist discourses existed around another potential blot on the landscape in the form of traveller encampments. The urban/suburban boundary was furthermore insecure because polluting urban elements, &#x2018;yobs&#x2019; as well as racialized &#x2018;others&#x2019; (<indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000507"><primary>immigrants</primary></indexterm>immigrants, especially those from <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000041"><primary>Africa</primary></indexterm>Africa and eastern Europe), were flowing down the Thames and seeping into Eastside. Rather than the pure suburb of the socially aspirant imagination, Eastside constituted a &#x2018;spoiled suburb&#x2019;, one that contained too many dirty, disorderly elements of city life.

 <para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001381" role="fullOut">Given this association, it is scarcely surprising that it is non-normative, non-reproductive sexuality that is most closely associated with disgust and boundary transgression. Sex shops, for example, are aggressively regulated through zoning and obscenity laws, as are their products. But nothing generates quite as much horror these days as sex offenders and sexual predators. From 1989 to 1999, a series of notification laws (often collectively referred to as Megan&#x2019;s laws, after Megan Kanka, the child rape-murder victim of a repeat offender) have dovetailed with a series of measures aimed at containing the mobility of sex offenders within high density areas to create an unprecedented apparent transparency and geographic precision in mapping the locations of the &#x2018;polluting&#x2019; threat posed by such individuals. By 1999, all 50 states of the USA had passed some such legislation.<footnote label="5" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001382" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001383">See Daniel M.

In turn, many cities have passed laws regulating where such offenders may live &#x2013; keeping them 1000, 2000 or 2500 feet from various sites considered especially vulnerable, such as schools or daycare centres. These laws promised to map the dangers of the urban landscape and eventually to contain them. However, this transparency is misleading and reveals more about our imaginary relationship to sex, &#x2018;dirt&#x2019; and the city than it does about actual dangers in the urban environment.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001389">Due to the density of population and therefore schools, churches and other proscribed areas, several cities have been forced to move their sexual offenders to nearby rural areas, where they then live in high concentrations, often unable to find jobs. Worse, the inability to settle in any viable place tends to make some offenders homeless. If they remain homeless, or find a home in a proscribed area, they often go &#x2018;off the grid&#x2019;, failing to report their location. Many police and district attorneys consider this problem more serious than having offenders living near a church.<footnote label="8" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001390" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001391">For a representative example, see Robert Santiago and Sara Olkon, &#x2018;Molester ban poses risks, some say&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Miami Beach Herald</emphasis>, Monday 19 September 2005.</para></footnote> City officials often resort to placing &#x2018;undesirable&#x2019; people and property just beyond the edge of the city in poor neighborhoods, or in industrial areas.

This city, then, is less a particular city or settlement than the idea of a city as it was manifested in classical and medieval times. This concept of the city continues to inform the utopian side of city planning and, indeed, city life. However, its dark underside, the threat of the specifically urban predator enabled by the density and anonymity that makes civic freedom uniquely possible, has been a dominant strand in representations of the city from about the late eighteenth century onward, and in twentieth-century America has been the occasion of repeated <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000668"><primary>moral panics</primary></indexterm>moral panics.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001501">Agamben argues that the Hobbesian &#x2018;state of nature&#x2019; has historically been understood in law not as a period prior to the founding of the city, but a principle internal to the city, &#x2018;the exception and the threshold that<?page value="101"?> constitutes and dwells within it&#x2019;.<footnote label="40" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001502" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001503">Agamben, <emphasis role="italic">Homo Sacer</emphasis>, p. 106.</para></footnote> When civility is dissolved, the state of nature is what is left, and the whole notion of civility is based on the assumption that such a state is possible at any time. It is this that upholds the authority of the law selectively to declare a person <emphasis role="italic">homo sacer</emphasis> &#x2013; the enemy of all, the wolf-man without peace, the man against whom every hand is raised without penalty. Although, of course, legally, the sex offender&#x2019;s position is not so exaggerated (except possibly in <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000610"><primary>Louisiana</primary></indexterm>Louisiana where <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000185"><primary>capital punishment</primary></indexterm>capital punishment is stipulated for certain sex offences), socially, this is not a wholly inaccurate depiction. Although it should go without saying, I will go on record here that I am not advocating a permissive attitude to sexual violence or coercion. But, as we have already seen, many of those described as &#x2018;sex offenders&#x2019; do not fit the definition of those against whom such legislation was designed to protect.<footnote label="41" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001504" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001505">In fact, it undercuts its effectiveness, distracting communities with the spectacle of multiple &#x2018;threats&#x2019; from the few genuine dangers it might highlight.</para></footnote> Through notification laws, such offenders are set apart and stripped of legal protections available to other categories of offenders. Although not legally subject to beatings and murder, in fact that is often the result of notification publicity. Legislators and private citizens alike frequently describe offenders as filth, trash, vermin and other nonhuman objects of disgust and loathing. Their imaginary relationship to the civility of the population as well as to the dystopian urban imaginary, frames such offenders as <emphasis role="italic">homines sacri</emphasis>.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001506">If sex offenders, then, operate in the social imaginary as the guarantors of our civility, who can no longer simply be expunged from the city but must remain within and of it as foci for communal loathing, then zoning restrictions against such offenders supply us with a spatial metaphor for civility and safety. The fact that their locations are mapped offers the fantasy of a city whose dangers can be made entirely legible, as well as a complementary horror story in which such dangers are liable to pop out of every apartment building. Moreover, if such mapping identifies zones of purity or civility, it is telling that schools, daycare centres and churches are what we choose to protect. (Are there really more children at church than in the mall? And, for that matter, are they not safer at church and school, where they are more likely to be accompanied by adults, than at a mall or fast food outlet? And why are children singled out more than adults?) There is nothing obvious about the spatial containment of sexual offenders. In an era of internet connections, mere proximity to a church centre is hardly the most serious threat to anyone&#x2019;s safety. An able bodied sex offender ought to be able to walk 2500 feet. Also, since most offenders on the database target women and female adolescents more than children, it might make more sense to keep them away from women&#x2019;s bookstores and gynaecological clinics than daycare centres. Although such zoning suggests that sex offences are crimes of opportunity, we do not treat other crimes of opportunity this way &#x2013; forcing car thieves to live far from public parking lots, for example.</para>

They are not polar opposites, but contiguous grounds whose segregation depends on constant vigilance to guarantee our own civility.

To contain symbolically the threat of the disgust that <emphasis role="italic">must</emphasis> lie at the heart of such autonomy, pleasure and power, we create the <emphasis role="italic">homo sacer</emphasis>, or wolf man, the imaginary child molester. And, in the expansion and proliferation of this symbolic threat, real dangers are masked and diluted within an enormous crowd of imaginary bogeys. Their association with filth mobilizes structures of feeling associated with the city and the body that obscure the function of sex offenders in our culture while seeming to make transparent the structure of our urban communities.</para>

Matt Houlbrook&#x2019;s <emphasis role="italic">Queer London: Perils and Pleasures in the Sexual Metropolis, 1918&#x2013;1957</emphasis> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005) focuses on London&#x2019;s hidden homosexual geography while sex between men was still a criminal offence. Key sites for anonymous sexual encounters were London&#x2019;s public urinals &#x2013; spaces whose association with bodily fluids also stigmatized homosexual men as &#x2018;dirty&#x2019;. As Houlbrook (<bibliolist xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001527" role="inline"><bibliomixed role="other" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001528"><title><emphasis role="italic">Queer London</emphasis></title>, p. <pagenums>63</pagenums></bibliomixed></bibliolist>) puts it: &#x2018;The discursive production of person and place was a mutually constitutive process, in which notions of the queer&#x2019;s character were derived from the nature of that site at which he was most often arrested.&#x2019; Gradually, as a result of increased legal and societal acceptance of homosexuality, there has been a shift in gay meeting places from the public spaces of the city (such as after-dark parks and public urinals) to a commercial scene primarily consisting of pubs and clubs: while these gay venues are less associated with &#x2018;dirt&#x2019; than public urinals, gay pubs and clubs are frequently portrayed as contaminated with perversion or moral corruption and, during the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, with contagious sexual disease. Another book, Seth Koven&#x2019;s <emphasis role="italic">Slumming: Sexual and Social Politics in Victorian London</emphasis> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2004) has shown how temporary accommodation for the homeless in London&#x2019;s Victorian slums &#x2013; the so-called workhouses &#x2013; were seen as not only physically dirty, but also as breeding grounds for homosexuality and disease. This equation between homelessness and homosexuality survived long into the twentieth-century and was famously depicted in George Orwell&#x2019;s <emphasis role="italic">Down and Out in London and Paris</emphasis> (London: Victor Gollancz, 1933), which &#x2018;marked the culmination of a long history of Victorian and Edwardian social reporting in Britain that imagined the slums of London not only as sites of physical and social disorder &#x2013; &#x201C;dirt&#x201D; &#x2013; but as spaces hospitable to &#x201C;queer&#x201D; lives and &#x201C;queer&#x201D; sexual desires&#x2019; (<bibliolist xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001533" role="inline"><bibliomixed role="other" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001534"><author><personname role="last-first"><surname>Koven</surname></personname></author>, <title><emphasis role="italic">Slumming</emphasis></title>, p. <pagenums>183</pagenums></bibliomixed></bibliolist>).</para></footnote> these media representations stigmatized London&#x2019;s gay venues as dangerous and contagious spaces associated with violent crime and sexual disease. The architectural features of gay pubs at the time, which tended to be dark spaces with discreet entrances and exteriors, came to symbolize an unhealthy and hidden subculture associated with sexual contamination. Here it will be suggested that the emergence of a new type of gay venue in the early 1990s, characterized by open-fronted fa&#x00E7;ades, minimalist interior design, and natural light, can be read as a commercial response to this earlier stigmatization. In particular, the use of hygiene aesthetics and certain forms of aesthetic labour were effective attempts to rid the commercial gay scene of some of its unhealthy connotations in the midst of the AIDS crisis. Earlier work on the gay scene in Soho has focused on the new visibility of gay men in public spaces, which was primarily achieved through the entrepreneurial clustering of venues within a small territory.<footnote label="2" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001535" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001536">Jon Binnie, &#x2018;Trading places: consumption, sexuality and the production of queer space&#x2019;, in David Bell and Gill Valentine (eds) <emphasis role="italic">Mapping Desire: Geographies of Sexualities</emphasis> (London: Routledge 1995); Frank Mort, <emphasis role="italic">Cultures of Consumption: Masculinities and Social Space in Late Twentieth-Century Britain</emphasis> (London: Routledge 1996); Mark W.

Soho has at different points in time been identified as London&#x2019;s French quarter, bohemia and red-light district, but since the 1980s the area has increasingly been associated with the media industries and trendy nightlife. The concentration of several gay venues in this centrally located but relatively secluded and pedestrian friendly area was significant because it created a space in which same sex desire was expressed openly in the streets.<footnote label="26" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001623" role="end-bk-note"><bibliolist xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001625"><bibliomixed role="other" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001626"><author><personname role="last-first"><surname>Binnie</surname></personname></author>, &#x2018;<title>Trading places</title>&#x2019;.</bibliomixed></bibliolist></footnote> In aesthetic terms the new gay venues also looked different: in contrast to the discreet and dark gay pubs of the past, they were bright spaces marketed as &#x2018;continental bars&#x2019; with open-fronted entrances.</para>

These social changes occurred at a time when AIDS was still predominantly seen as a gay disease and there are well-documented examples of fears over contamination of the straight population. In that respect, Soho&#x2019;s hygiene aesthetics should not merely be seen as an internal gay marketing strategy, but also as a reflection of society&#x2019;s wider anxieties about homosexuality and AIDS at the time. Gay men were increasingly tolerated, but only in the desexualized context of the new gay economy, whose sanitized spaces seemed to protect society at large from the contamination associated with an earlier homosexual subculture.</para>

In this chapter I present a novel interpretation of Christian social policy as &#x2018;spiritual cleaning&#x2019;. I analyse the process of cleansing through the use of anthropological theories of danger and pollution, rather than presenting it as the product of sentiment and religious morality, as previous work has tended to do.<footnote label="1" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001693" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001694">John Maynard, <emphasis role="italic">Victorian Discourses on Sexuality and Religion</emphasis> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993).</para></footnote> Dirt is, of course, often physical matter that has come into inappropriate physical contact, as in mud washed from hands by a bar of soap.

It was therefore widely believed not only that a prostitute&#x2019;s body was physically tainted but that her soul (and therefore her mind) was morally tainted too.

Christopher Otter has recently employed this Foucauldian approach in his study of slaughter houses and electricity generation in late Victorian London. He discusses technologies of cleansing as systems of control and authority that intervened in the urban environment, both physically and ideologically, to reveal and cleanse.<footnote label="4" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001702" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001703">Christopher Otter, &#x2018;Cleansing and clarifying: technology and perception in nineteenth-century London&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Journal of British Studies</emphasis>, vol. 43, 2004, pp. 40&#x2013;65.</para></footnote> Such approaches emphasize the power of the cleansers as being primarily classificatory in determining exactly what needs to be cleansed. A number of case studies of regimes of sanitation have followed this approach, for example Warwick Anderson&#x2019;s study of American doctors and scientists in the colonized Philippines of the early twentieth century. Anderson writes of the &#x2018;medical production of colonial bodies and colonial space&#x2019;, in which the &#x2018;vulnerable, formalized bodies of the American colonists demanded sanitary quarantine&#x2019;.<footnote label="5" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001704" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001705">Warwick Anderson, &#x2018;Excremental colonialism: public health and the poetics of pollution&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Critical Inquiry</emphasis>, vol. 21, 1995, pp. 640&#x2013;69.</para></footnote> The Americans defined the locals as unclean and thereby generated a sanitary justification for their own presence.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001710">However, the case of Christian technologies of cleansing as employed in Victorian London is quite specific in the interactions between moral and physical factors in the ideologies of cleansing.

In fact, many evangelical Protestants thought that prostitutes should be left to God&#x2019;s judgement. So the power structures that Anglo-Catholics sought to establish need to be seen, not just in the context of worldly hierarchies, but in relation to the specifically Catholic belief in the value of good works as an aid to personal salvation.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001711">I will argue that because medical, psychological and sociological discourses and practices of sanitation have come subsequently to predominate, it is easy to forget the importance of technologies of spiritual cleansing in the evolution of the western metropolis. Moreover, the theoretical approaches that work well for the former discourses and their associated technologies of cleansing need to be rethought in the case of the latter. How then, did Christian reformers attempt to deal with early Victorian prostitution and how, thereby, were they attempting to transform urban geographies of sexual pollution? First, I shall examine the reasons for increasing concerns with dirt and pollution in general, thereby establishing the theoretical basis for my understanding of dirt as not so much a category in itself but as an aspect of boundary <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000957"><primary>transgression</primary></indexterm>transgression.

Christian moralizing was, however, nothing new, so why the sudden upsurge of activity?

Cultural theorists regard this as one stage in a long process of increasing concern about filth.

The growing size of cities and the complexity of life within them provided ample material for scientific and moral classification, which not only documented but also provided the basis for policing burgeoning social, cultural and economic diversity. Medicine and social science proceeded, therefore, to develop typologies of physical and social disease, as in <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000645"><primary>Mayhew, Henry</primary></indexterm>Henry Mayhew&#x2019;s surveys of London and categorizations of the urban poor published in 1849&#x2013;50 and 1861&#x2013;2.<footnote label="8" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001718" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001719">Henry Mayhew, <emphasis role="italic">London Labour and the London Poor</emphasis> (London: Constable, 1968).</para></footnote></para>

Women were, after all, taken in from the streets and held in a special building until it was deemed safe to let them out. However, the hospital is a better comparison (but not the mental hospital since inmates could not discharge themselves from there).

But in one major way, this reformatory, like others being established across the country at the time, was conceptually more radical. The basis for this radicalism lay in the Gospels. Liddell pointed out that Christ offered his healing touch to the leper, though the latter was unclean. Therefore, Liddell drew the conclusion that no instance of &#x2018;physical or spiritual evil was <emphasis role="italic">so bad</emphasis> as to be <emphasis role="italic">beyond the reach</emphasis> of his compassion&#x2019; (original italics).<footnote label="40" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001891" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001892">Robert Liddell, <emphasis role="italic">Christ the Caster-out of Unclean Spirits:</emphasis> A <emphasis role="italic">Sermon Preached at St Paul&#x2019;s, Knightsbridge, on the Fourth Sunday after Epiphany in Behalf of the Church Penitentiary Cause [on Matt. viii. 29]</emphasis> (London: J.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001901">The implications of this are dramatic: this was not a prison and the inmates were not automatically inferior. In a prison the gaolers are not held to be criminals, the prisoners are; while in a hospital the patients are sick and the staff are those who are held to be well. By contrast, in the penitentiary the fact of original sin (which subsisted since the expulsion from the Garden of Eden) meant that everyone was seen as spiritually sick, even the staff. Moreover, the prostitutes&#x2019; clients were also exhorted in church sermons to acknowledge their own spiritual malaise. There was another difference: medicine always recognized certain cases as incurable. The Anglo-Catholic system made no such recognition. These two factors did not, as we have seen, overturn the perceived importance of <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000134"><primary>boundaries</primary></indexterm>boundaries and prohibitions or remove the notion of the prostitute as polluter of the city&#x2019;s streets. However, the Anglo-Catholic system did create a sense of dirt as being something that was relative rather than absolute. And, since everyone could be redeemed there was value in everyone. The implication in this system of cleansing institutions was that society should think carefully before throwing away human rubbish. It is a technology of recycling more than of disposal.</para>

These maps laid the conceptual and practical foundations for the world&#x2019;s first citywide sewage network, the main <?page value="124"?>drainage system eventually constructed in the 1860s. Focusing for the first time on the interrelation between these three maps, I will bring out the contradictions inherent in the conceptualization of these new sewer spaces &#x2013; contradictions overlooked in the existing literature on the subject.<footnote label="2" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001925" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0001926">Ida Darlington, &#x2018;Edwin Chadwick and the first large-scale Ordnance Survey of London&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Transactions of London and Middlesex Archaeological Society</emphasis>, vol. 22, 1969, pp. 58&#x2013;63; Lynda Nead, <emphasis role="italic">Victorian Babylon: People, Streets and Images in Nineteenth-century London</emphasis> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000) pp. 18&#x2013;22; and Rosa Lynn B.

Yet, Edwin Chadwick eventually mapped these old dilapidated spaces as overlays onto the Ordnance Survey plan, which was, in effect, an attempt to combine two conflicting types of sewer space. When such apparent opposites &#x2013; new and old, and clean and dirty &#x2013; are brought together within an ideology that stresses their polarity, they inevitably throw up contradictions that upset this ideology and serve to bring out the more complex reality it conceals.</para>

Chadwick viewed the control of the old sewer spaces, with all their problems, as essential to the future success of any new system. This literal descent into the &#x2018;bowels&#x2019; of the city conforms to another common representational trope in Victorian London: the &#x2018;view from below&#x2019;. Unlike the view from above, which placed the city&#x2019;s substratum at a safe and clean distance, the view from below positively revelled in the dirt and chaos of subterranean spaces: in effect, a modern variant on the descent into the underworld seen in ancient mythologies.<footnote label="25" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002029" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-1002029">Pike, <emphasis role="italic">Subterranean Cities</emphasis>, pp. 9&#x2013;10.</para></footnote> However, for those who carried out the subterranean survey there was to be no such abandonment: it was to have the same scientific basis as the Ordnance Survey, as rigorous and panoramic as its counterpart from above.

The areas eventually mapped were the City of Westminster and a small area of Kensington, with 28 sheets being produced in total &#x2013; 13 for Westminster and 15 for Kensington (see MCS/P/25/ pp. 1&#x2013;15). However, all the maps remained as base plans with none of the details of house drainage inserted; in 1849 this survey was abandoned. Sewer information was eventually hand drawn onto the five feet to one mile sheets of the Ordnance Survey (as seen in <link linkend="b-9780755694235-fig10.3" role="figure">Figure 10.3</link>). This process occurred at a later date than the subterranean survey, probably during or after the mid-1850s. Over 300 of these maps are currently held in the Thames Water archive at the Abbey Mills pumping station in London.</para></footnote> In this map, the representation of the old sewers &#x2013; seen in <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000083"><primary>Austin, Henry</primary></indexterm>Austin and <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000893"><primary>Smith, Joseph</primary></indexterm>Smith&#x2019;s reports and the surveyor&#x2019;s notebook &#x2013; is dramatically transformed: gone is the detailed information so rigorously collated by the surveyors; and gone is the sense of these sewers as disconnected and disjointed spaces &#x2013; characteristics that dominated Austin and Smith&#x2019;s reports. Depicted instead is an obvious network of sewers seen over a wide area with major sewers, such as the King&#x2019;s Scholars Pond Sewer (shown at the top left of the sheet), given visual prominence by large-scale labelling. The interrelation of the existing sewers is stressed rather than specific indicators of their condition. Additional information is also overlaid onto the base plan: parish <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000137"><primary>boundaries</primary></indexterm>boundaries (black dashed lines); the names of some of the individual parishes (St John the Evangel[ist] at the top centre and right-hand side); and waterways (coloured blue in the original). These features, omitted from the skeleton plan (<link role="figure" linkend="b-9780755694235-fig10.4">Figure 10.4</link>), serve to introduce descriptive elements that highlight the existing topographical features and boundaries of the city. In short, they transform the skeletal plan into something quite different. If the original intentions of the subterranean survey &#x2013; to gain &#x2018;a true picture &#x2026; of the existing drainage beneath the surface&#x2019; &#x2013; are diluted by this map then the structural unity of the Ordnance Survey is also undermined by the superimposition of a representation of the old on top of a potential new. In short, this map is no longer a unified view of the city, but an uneasy combination of opposing elements: old and new; clean and dirty; divisions and unity.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002075">This combination map also represents an attempt to combine the two views of the city described above: the view from above and the view from below. With this conflation a new play of meaning is put in motion: the view from below, with its old, dirty and decaying sewer spaces and confusion of administrative boundaries disturbs the abstract unity of the Ordnance Survey plans &#x2013; the view from above. Rather, this map suggests an incomplete and more complex meaning. The depiction of the old sewers, built under the control of the old sewer commissions, and the reintroduction of the existing parish boundaries that determined the limits <?page value="136"?>of this control, undermine the structural unity seen in the Ordnance Survey plans. The city can no longer be seen as a seamless whole; instead, the existing and the old impede the assertion of such a &#x2018;totalizing&#x2019; view, bringing out the contradictions at the heart of Chadwick&#x2019;s ideology of improvement. The scientific rationale of the Ordnance Survey, which mirrored Chadwick&#x2019;s new vision of the city, could not quite incorporate the <?page value="137"?>old spaces into its dominating framework. For a moment, the two coexisted in a state of unresolved tension.</para>

Central to any conception of improvement is the articulation of a relation between old and new; notions of improvement, whether sanitary or otherwise, tend to present this relation in simplistic terms: that is, the old &#x2013; represented as retrogressive and dirty &#x2013; is forced to give way to the new &#x2013; invariably cast as progressive and cleansing. However, even in seemingly insignificant representations (in this case sewer maps), slippages can be detected within these ideologies that, in themselves, suggest the existence of a more nuanced set of relations between old and new that might yet still be uncovered.

The further complexity of the representation of these spaces arises from the fact that we are not accustomed to articulating these different qualities simultaneously; indeed, the ways we categorize space vertically militate against our doing so.

The subway, or underground railway, embodies the quotidian qualities of the underground; it is nearly always associated with work, daily routine and the &#x2018;average&#x2019; citizen. In contrast, the sewer carries in its waters the atavistic and organic elements of the city, its waste, its filth, its repressions, its dirty secrets. The subway is an extension of everyday life in its banality, its excitements, or its horrors; the sewer is a transformative experience, a descent to the underworld from which one returns, if at all, a changed individual.</para>

Hugo conceived of Paris as a living organism, a &#x2018;Leviathan&#x2019; that would feed on the rich produce of the surrounding country, digesting what was of immediate value and excreting through its sewers as fertilizer to be returned to that countryside what it could not make immediately useful.

The underlying message, we may assume, is that the powers-that-be regard the (underground) homeless as urban disposal; like Ram&#x00F3;n, they return transformed to wreak havoc on the surface world that begot them. There are several differences from the mutant alligator, however, the first being that the CHUDs are wholly unsympathetic, undiscriminating and evil vehicles of <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000287"><primary>death</primary></indexterm>death. By contrast, the movie&#x2019;s nondeformed &#x2018;undergrounders&#x2019; are uniformly Caucasian; as opposed to the mutant CHUDs, they are also distinguished as homeless cosmetically rather than physically, by virtue of a bit of charcoal smeared over their faces.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002135">The symbolic topography established by the use of the underground space combines progressive environmental ideology with some dubious racial politics. As in <emphasis role="italic">Alligator</emphasis>, the villains are the officials who sacrifice the welfare <?page value="145"?>of the city to their own greed and misdeeds. Because there remains a dwindling colony of &#x2018;good&#x2019; undergrounders, subjects photographed by Cooper, the ones transformed into CHUDs belong to the category of those who have turned bad. Conversely, the survivors, whom we meet on our first descent into the tunnels in the company of Cooper, inhabit an open, arched space; their association with a positive underground is reinforced by their names of <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000477"><primary>Hugo, Victor</primary></indexterm>Victor and Hugo, one of the filmmakers&#x2019; several self-conscious gestures to past influences. The sociological division between temporary and permanent homelessness, between lesser and greater separation from aboveground values, is thus troped along racial lines. The goodness of the white victims is reinforced by their high-culture resonance (<emphasis role="italic">Les Mis&#x00E9;rables</emphasis>), while their minimal makeup suggests the possibility of simple retrieval to &#x2018;normal&#x2019; society. The &#x2018;blackness&#x2019; of the CHUDs, in contrast, is biologically permanent, for their very humanity is put into question by it. Moreover, they resonate with the popular culture of <emphasis role="italic">The Time Machine&#x2019;s</emphasis> Morlocks, and are shown to have no chance of returning to the world above. There are in fact no easy racial or ethnic splits in homelessness in general or among underground dwellers in particular; however, the power of cultural representations of these groups seems to derive from a symbolic vertical hierarchy reduced, precisely, to racial lines.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002177" role="fullOut">The last section of this book contains four chapters that examine relationships between notions of dirt and purity and constructions of the rural.

While imaginings of the rural as pure and healthy have always been central to debates on urban decay, little attention has been paid to the realities of rural life, and the traditions of writing on <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000979"><primary>urban sanitation</primary></indexterm>urban sanitation, squalor and decay have no counterpart in rural studies. The countryside does not, however, have a simple relationship with dirt. The countryside has repeatedly been conceived of as a space of moral purity and uncorrupted by the worldliness of city life. It is also imagined as being physically clean and healthy, a place to go to for fresh air and clean water. However, rural life is also traditionally based on real dirt &#x2013; on mud, manure and human sweat. The grand sanitizing projects that have attempted to clean and &#x2018;civilize&#x2019; the city &#x2013; paving, street sweeping and mains <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000857"><primary>sewerage</primary></indexterm>sewerage &#x2013; are largely absent from rural areas even in the most developed countries, leading to city dwellers&#x2019; stereotypical representations of the countryside as dirty in the sense of being uncivilized and wild.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002178">The chapters in this section suggest that imaginings of rural life, and its products, involve the mapping of dirt and <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000229"><primary>cleanliness</primary></indexterm>cleanliness onto &#x2018;the rural&#x2019; and &#x2018;the urban&#x2019; in unexpected ways. In a range of contexts the positive connotations of traditional rural life can be seen to be embodied in and read from rural dirt. When cleanliness is associated with <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000661"><primary>modernity</primary></indexterm>modernity and capitalism, dirt can take on positive attributes, representing time-honoured ways of life, closer and more equitable social relationships. The consistency of such associations endures despite the geographical spread of the objects of study in the following chapters, from <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000933"><primary>Thailand</primary></indexterm>Thailand to the UK and USA. Three of the authors use the example of foods &#x2013; the produce of rural environments &#x2013; to explore the ways in which dirt moves between people and places, constructing and reflecting relationships between them. In <emphasis role="italic">Purity and Danger</emphasis>, <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000321"><primary>Douglas, Mary</primary></indexterm>Mary Douglas discusses food <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000496"><primary>hybridity</primary><secondary>hygiene</secondary></indexterm>hygiene in relation to <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000803"><primary>religion</primary></indexterm>religion and risk; these emerging <?page value="154"?><indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000030"><primary>actor-network theory (ANT)</primary></indexterm>geographies of food and environmental <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000497"><primary>hybridity</primary><secondary>hygiene</secondary></indexterm>hygiene add new knowledge to the field and insist that we re-examine notions of purity and danger in relation to contemporary practices, cultures and anxieties &#x2013; particularly those linked to health and class status.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002179">Together, the chapters in this section demonstrate that dirt is not always a threat to be avoided but can be sought out and embraced. Their authors show clearly that dirt is not necessarily &#x2018;matter out of place&#x2019; in the country, but is rather an integral part of how the countryside is constructed, in the imaginations of both rural communities and urban dwellers.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002180">The first chapter provides a link with the urban studies in section two, examining how dirt and cleanliness play a part in rural migrants&#x2019; experiences of <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000088"><primary>Bangkok</primary></indexterm>Bangkok.

Perceptions of hygiene and dirt operate metaphorically to suggest the civilized and developed, and their opposities. Brody shows how the realities of this dichotomy are lived out every day by a group of cleaners working in a gleaming Bangkok shopping mall. She contrasts the constraints of their lives at the mall, where they work to produce the spotless surfaces that represent modernity to urban middle-class consumers, with the greater freedom and quality of rural life that they return to when they have the opportunity to do so.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002181">Following this, <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000354"><primary>Enticott, Gareth</primary></indexterm>Gareth Enticott shows how, in a completely different part of the world, dirt and <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000512"><primary>impurity</primary></indexterm>impurity can similarly represent community and belonging.

We argue that for these consumers the dirt visible on food represents a whole range of positive relationships and characteristics and can be seen as part of a moral framework within which foods are chosen and consumed. Dirt testifies to foods&#x2019; provenance in a particular place, grown by a particular type of person, and signals its proximity to nature. Conversely the &#x2018;hyperclean&#x2019; produce sold in supermarkets are viewed as immoral and &#x2018;contaminated&#x2019; through negative associations such as unknown provenance, contact with chemicals, aesthetic uniformity resulting from the methods of <?page value="155"?><indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000147"><primary>bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)</primary></indexterm>production and distribution associated with globalization, and the bland taste of standardized food varieties.</para>

Next to the mall sprawls a large slum community, the occupants of which include a significant proportion of the migrants who flood to Bangkok from the rural northeast and north looking for economic opportunity in the overcrowded metropolis. The spaces are seemingly discrete, totally separate in character and function. Inside the mall is a gleaming, almost sanitized calm, where people move as if half asleep. In the community space next door there is a sensual overload &#x2013; smells of cooking and of fetid drains; people talking and laughing loudly; children crying. Relations between the two spaces, however, are porous &#x2013; many of those living in the community also work in the mall, and many community-dwellers sell souvenirs to the coach loads of tourists arriving at the mall. But the physical separation is visible in the shape of the tall corrugated iron walls that enclose the community and effectively hide it from outside view.</para>

At <emphasis role="italic">Songkran</emphasis>, the Thai new year, Bangkok is noticeably quieter because its migrants return to their villages for the annual celebrations. Migration is not only a contemporary Thai phenomenon.

In the past 30 years the number of people migrating for work in urban centres has escalated because of the rapid growth of opportunities in manufacturing, construction and service industries. Bangkok, as the core of Thailand&#x2019;s accelerated modernization and as Thailand&#x2019;s administrative heart, has always attracted the largest number of migrants. Over two million people came to the city from rural areas in the 1980s and <?page value="158"?>&#x2018;possibly a further million entered the urban work-force on a temporary basis&#x2019;.<footnote label="3" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002201" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-1002201">Phongpaichit and Baker, <emphasis role="italic">Thailand</emphasis>, p. 153.</para></footnote> Although many of the migrants are from northern Thailand, the largest percentage has always been from the northeast, known as <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000524"><primary>Ireland, Colin</primary><secondary>Isan</secondary></indexterm>Isan.

The countless newly erected, modern &#x2018;glittering towers&#x2019; convey messages of affluence and progress. A defining space of the contemporary urban experience in Bangkok is the shopping mall. The mall satisfies a national obsession with shopping, which until recently was largely carried out in open markets and Chinese-owned shops in formal and informal spaces of towns and cities, while the promise of air-conditioned comfort adds the patina of luxury that modernity represents to many.

The longest period spent working at the mall was five years and the shortest was one month, but this was difficult to gauge because the women sometimes worked for a short time, returned to their villages and then reapplied to the company at a later date. Many of the women had learnt about the company through friends or family, and came directly from their villages rather than getting the work after a period in Bangkok doing other work, although some had previous experience of working in the city.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002236">Every morning they would line up, with the supervisors in front and rows of cleaners facing them. The head supervisor and sometimes a representative from the shopping mall management addressed the cleaners. While at work upstairs, the cleaners assigned to the toilets could not move from their stations. Those in the main body of the mall kept to a specific area but were chastised if they were not seen to be working constantly. If I stopped to talk to any of the cleaners, a supervisor would inevitably arrive and send them off in another direction with their mops. Most notably, in the gregarious, sociable atmosphere of the mall, where customers and shop assistants talked and laughed, the cleaners worked alone and silently. As noted below, the rules stated that they were not allowed to chat with other cleaners and they were discouraged from talking to shoppers unless approached for some reason. The silence of the cleaners in the public spaces was notable in a country where the exchange of banter is a constant backdrop and an important aspect of social identity. Thus, the cleaners&#x2019; presence was strategically managed to produce the illusion of invisibility: the cleaners were there, but you did not see them unless you were aware of them.</para>

There was an outcry from the Lao women&#x2019;s union, but no apology was given.

These discourses were made obvious to me during the fieldwork for this chapter in my conversations with middle-class urban Thais who were always concerned, when I spent time in the Thai countryside, that it would be &#x2018;very dirty&#x2019;.

Given the highly evocative conceptions of dirt and cleanliness outlined above, it is not surprising that the employment of an army of cleaners is an integral aspect of urban shopping mall culture.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002286" role="fullOut">Thai society is extremely hierarchical, with respect and deference paid to older relatives and colleagues. In the workplace this attention to social place is reflected in the epithet &#x2018;<emphasis role="italic">phi&#x2019;</emphasis> (older sibling) being accorded to someone of higher status and &#x2018;<emphasis role="italic">nong</emphasis>&#x2019; (younger sibling) to someone who is considered lower in the social pecking order. For example, in a restaurant, it is customary to refer to waiting staff in a restaurant as <emphasis role="italic">nong</emphasis>, regardless of their age. These distinctions were deployed within the mall in ways that were made very clear to me on my first day of conducting research there. The assumption of many supervisors had been that I would eat my lunch with them inside the office, separate from the cleaners. My announcement that I wanted to eat with the cleaners to get to know them elicited raised eyebrows and some consternation: &#x2018;You want to eat with the children (<emphasis role="italic">dek dek</emphasis>)?&#x2019; one supervisor quizzed me, referring to the cleaners who were eating their lunch in the common area outside.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002287">A clear distinction between the groups was the types of work in which they engaged and the opportunities for public display &#x2013; for being part of the mall&#x2019;s active, visible meanings &#x2013; that the post of supervisor offered. Within the dominant, middle-class conception of moral worth and sophistication physical labour is connected with a lack of progress, coarseness, and backwardness, particularly when it involves working in dirty conditions.<footnote label="17" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002288" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002289">For example, gangs of prisoners can be seen cleaning out drains and sewers, since this is considered lowly work, worthy of criminals.</para></footnote> I observed that while the mall was a public space, during its opening hours the supervisors avoided physical cleaning work. Their time was occupied with walking around the mall monitoring the ongoing work. They would also spend a considerable amount of time putting on make-up and painting their long fingernails, which were clearly not designed for dirty, physical labour. What was interesting was that these women were from similar backgrounds as the cleaners, often with similar qualifications; they did not earn much more than the cleaners and most of them also lived in the slum.

Using Bourdieu&#x2019;s analysis, I would like to argue that the process of migration and of working within a system where rules were imposed through hierarchical structures enabled the cleaners to view their rural lives and livelihoods through new eyes, to recognize that the fabric of their lives that they had taken for granted was a &#x2018;way of life&#x2019; worth valuing and, in many cases, worth returning to. At the same time they were able to reflect objectively on the practices that defined their working lives in <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000091"><primary>Bangkok</primary></indexterm>Bangkok, and on the urban ideals that framed them.

The ability to &#x2018;withstand hardship&#x2019; (<emphasis role="italic">oton wai</emphasis>) was a recurring theme in my conversations with the women, and comparisons would often be made with the &#x2018;weak&#x2019; and &#x2018;lazy&#x2019; Bangkok people, who did not know the meaning of hard work and were more concerned about outward appearances. These observations were couched in the knowledge that working with dirt, particularly human waste, did not bestow high status on the women in the larger social picture, but that there was pride to be derived from doing the job well and providing a service. This perspective was succinctly expressed in <?page value="165"?>the life story of Tuk, an Isan cleaner in her late twenties who was a single mother and supported a child and her elderly mother, both of whom were living in rural Isan. She indicated that some of the women with whom she had worked were ashamed to be cleaning toilets for a living. These women&#x2019;s fickle attitudes became a foil for Tuk&#x2019;s own attitudes to work, and for the strength of character she saw as integral to her own survival and success. She told me:</para>

Although the women made it clear that tending to rice fields and other crops was hard work, requiring physical endurance, what they missed was the unstructured time, the lack of a rigidly fixed routine and the sense of autonomy they felt.

The labour practices the women encountered in the mall reveal much about the assumptions underpinning processes of modernization in Thailand, as well as reinforcing certain organizational principles of a more generic modern &#x2018;company culture&#x2019;.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002321">In particular, I have highlighted the importance of notions of dirt and <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000232"><primary>cleanliness</primary></indexterm>cleanliness in providing a notional boundary between &#x2018;civilized&#x2019; and &#x2018;uncivilized&#x2019; people and spaces. Cleanliness is a metaphor for a Bangkok-centric vision of a new Thailand, marking a break with the perceived dirt and associated disorder of &#x2018;uncivilized&#x2019; rural existences. The cleaners employed to dispose of the dirt are part of the mall&#x2019;s subtext, necessarily visible in terms of the function they serve, but erased as individuals through the deployment of particular strategic rules and processes of &#x2018;atomization&#x2019; that keep them working in separate, allocated spaces. Against this threat of diminishment, however, the cleaners &#x2018;reclaimed&#x2019; a sense of their own importance in the mall&#x2019;s public script through the pride, or at least conscientiousness, in the jobs in which they were expected to be in direct contact with dirt and bodily waste.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002322">At the same time, by not allowing themselves to be defined by what they did and where they worked, they were able to put their work and the mall into perspective. This is partly because, by working in a system that treated <?page value="167"?>them as ubiquitous, they became able to see their rural lives objectively, as a &#x2018;way of life&#x2019; that shaped their values and goals. Their presence in Bangkok was an acknowledgement that it is increasingly unsustainable to rely on rural livelihoods alone. Yet, personal knowledge of these alternative working patterns enabled them to objectify practices within the mall and to forge &#x2018;everyday forms of resistance&#x2019;.<footnote label="21" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002323" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002324">Scott, <emphasis role="italic">Weapons of the Weak</emphasis>.</para></footnote><indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000839"><primary>Scott, Sue</primary></indexterm> These expressions of sociality and alternative relationships carved out of an otherwise humourless regime were, I suggest, more than a means for the women to survive the tedium of their long days.

It is a narrative that places less emphasis on the cosmetic, external qualities that are often part of the &#x2018;official&#x2019; projections of modernity I have discussed above. It is instead more concerned with earthy values such as honesty, hard work, love for one&#x2019;s family and love for the land, which it sees as fundamental to human well-being and national pride.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002328">As far as I know, these critical reflections on the cleaners&#x2019; working environment in the mall were never translated into open complaints. Instead, the women quietly subvert the structured, disciplined work regimes in ways that could be framed as &#x2018;everyday politics&#x2019; or, following Scott, &#x2018;everyday forms of resistance&#x2019;. For example, they appropriated spaces within the mall for sociality <emphasis role="italic">khwam sanuk</emphasis> (fun), aspects associated with rural work. Although the cleaners were not supposed to chat together during working hours, the toilet areas and some of the larger storage cupboards, situated away from the main shopping areas of the mall and from the eyes of the supervisors, often provided an arena where gossip could be exchanged. Flirtations were also played out in these spaces. When surveillance of the cleaners was increased during a period when the company was being assessed for an international ISO 9001 2000 standard, some of these small freedoms were undermined, creating an atmosphere of discontent and resentment.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002425">This journey from theoretical purity to hybridity highlights the complexity of such a task. But it also raises other questions. First, if hybridity leads back to a consideration of a socially constructed extensive self, what other extensive selves are there within the countryside? While some versions may be comprised by distinct patterns of heterogeneity, the countryside is highly differentiated.<footnote label="34" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002426" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002427">Jonathan Murdoch, Philip Lowe, Neil Ward and Terry Marsden, <emphasis role="italic">The Differentiated Countryside</emphasis> (London: Routledge, 2003).</para></footnote> It should be no surprise therefore, to find other extensive selves aligned to different interpretations of selfhood, attempting to secure themselves in different patterns of heterogeneous relations, each with their unique characteristics. In this way, by tracing these different sets of heterogeneity, we might also learn how the countryside becomes differentiated. Within these sets of heterogeneity, we might also be able to see how concepts such as impurity come to be defined and renegotiated by the actors implicated within them.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002428">Second, if different sets of heterogeneity are implicated within the extensive self, to what extent might we consider heterogeneous actors and relations other than humans shaping and influencing these modes of selfhood? In developing the concept of the extensive self, Murdoch relies on Bell&#x2019;s analysis of Childerley and portrays a set of heterogeneous relations revolving around a nature that is purified, socialized and disciplined. In this countryside there appears to be little ambivalence or resistance to this extensive self. Yet, in other patterns of heterogeneity, there might be greater opportunity for nonhuman agency to challenge and reconfigure these extensive selves, and in effect articulate a more ecological geographical or community self. These other extensive selves may find their relational identities challenged by a range of other forms of wild and impure nature, acting intentionally or &#x2018;transformatively&#x2019;.<footnote label="35" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002429" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002430">Paul Cloke and Owain Jones, <emphasis role="italic">Tree Cultures</emphasis> (Oxford: Berg, 2002).</para></footnote> Indeed, the inherent characteristics of these forms of nature and heterogeneous materials may be fundamental to their enrolment within these networks.

Further details can be found in Enticott, &#x2018;Heterogeneous ruralities&#x2019;.</para></footnote> It is perhaps no different from a number of other villages in the area in that it still has an agricultural focus but an increasing number of retirement and lifestyle counter-urbanizers are living alongside its longstanding local residents. In this sense, it is symbolic of the &#x2018;contested&#x2019; countryside.<footnote label="38" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002439" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002440">Murdoch et al., <emphasis role="italic">The Differentiated Countryside.</emphasis></para></footnote> The actions of one of the village farmers, however, mark Ash Dean out as different. Dairy farmer Michael Goswell sells his milk to residents; or rather, his wife takes bottles of milk round to residents every morning in her Land Rover.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002441">This is an unusual attempt at farm diversification, for the milk is unpasteurized and bottled straight from Michael Goswell&#x2019;s bulk tank in his dairy. This is a difficult job. It requires all manner of extra forms to fill in and bacterial tests to ensure that the milk passes public <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000500"><primary>hybridity</primary><secondary>hygiene</secondary></indexterm>hygiene regulations. Indeed, as Michael Goswell pointed out, it was largely more hassle than its worth. If he had to, he would give it up, but for his wife it was a way of staying in touch with friends throughout the village and catching up on village gossip. Pasteurizing the milk, though, would be far too costly: the milk round was a labour of love and not an economic endeavour.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002442">Not all the residents have the milk, but a substantial number do, mainly the families who have lived in the village since before anyone can remember. There are newcomers to the village who drink the milk, but there are also longstanding residents who do not consume it. Everyone though is aware of the risks, or at least the risks defined by public health agencies. For a start, the milk arrives in a bottle, which suggests potential hazards. Yet, the warnings of dangerous bacteria within the milk fail to put off the villagers.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002443">Instead, these risks are renegotiated through a range of lay understandings of risk, bacteria and health.

The lack of local evidence reassures them that there is no dangerous bacteria in the milk and reaffirms their consumption habits. Indeed, to make their point villagers point to the longevity of the village&#x2019;s most senior residents, reflecting ideas of &#x2018;candidacy&#x2019;<footnote label="39" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002444" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002445">Charlie Davison, George Davey Smith and Stephen Frankel, &#x2018;Lay epidemiology and the prevention paradox: implications of coronary candidacy for health education&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Sociology of Health and Illness</emphasis>, vol. 13, no. 1, 1991, pp. 1&#x2013;19.</para></footnote> from medical sociology.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002446">Contests over the impurity of unpasteurized milk also derive from a distinct culture of nature. The scientific view of unpasteurized milk presents a purified view of nature &#x2013; something that needs to be made inert, and completely free of the bacteria, <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000412"><primary>germs</primary></indexterm>germs and microbes associated with E.coli <?page value="174"?>and <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000823"><primary>salmonella</primary></indexterm>salmonella, before it is safe to consume. Pasteurization achieves this by sterilizing the milk and leaving it &#x2018;pure&#x2019;. Villagers, however, take issue with this view of purity. For them, pasteurization removes <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000413"><primary>germs</primary></indexterm>germs and bacteria whether they are harmful to health or not, resulting in a product stripped of natural life. Unpasteurized milk is viewed differently through a culture of nature, which embraces nature as alive and possessing its own transformative agency that can positively benefit human health. This culture of nature therefore revolves the benefits of all forms of nature, both good and bad. People should subject themselves to these effects by immersing themselves in nature by whatever means possible. However, for nature to improve health, then one needs to be exposed to nature in its entirety &#x2013; both its positive and negative features &#x2013; and it is only by experiencing both of these can one hope to benefit from nature. For these rural consumers then, &#x2018;clean&#x2019; and &#x2018;pure&#x2019; foods are to be regarded with suspicion and seen as hazardous. Those with impurities on the other hand are welcomed and regarded as healthy. For example:</para>

<blockquote xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002447">
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002448">I had to go into hospital a while back. When I was in there I asked them when I would be able to start drinking raw milk again. Anyway, they looked at me and said &#x2018;Raw milk &#x2013; what do you mean when? Never! Never!&#x2019; But they just don&#x2019;t understand do they? All these health regulations are stupid because now you are getting to a point where no one is getting any germs in food so they do not have the antibodies to fight off infection.</para></blockquote>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002449">This belief that &#x2018;germs are good&#x2019; is also embedded in ideas of what it means to be rural and local. A prevailing rural discourse is that &#x2018;rural people&#x2019;, through their daily contact with nature, have the most appropriate expertise for deciding what judgements to make about nature.<footnote label="40" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002450" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002451">Gareth Enticott, &#x2018;Calculating nature: the case of badgers, tuberculosis and cattle&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Journal of Rural Studies</emphasis>, vol. 17, no.2, 2001, pp.149&#x2013;64.</para></footnote> At the same time, possessing this experienced knowledge of nature is essential to claiming a true rural identity. Such a view is evident in the rejection of the impurity of unpasteurized milk. For a start, engaging with living nature is part of being rural. Rural people have to put up with both the positive and negative aspects of living with nature. However, these negativities need not be purified or hidden away. Rather, it is the process of living alongside them that allows a rural identity to co-evolve:</para>

<blockquote xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002452">

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002455" role="fullOut">The same is true in relation to the consumption of Michael Goswell&#x2019;s milk. Its visible consumption, for example by buying it from the village milk round, offers the opportunity to demonstrate one&#x2019;s rural status by conferring a rural identity. By drinking unpasteurized milk, consumers reveal that they know nature and all its facets. In doing so, consumers become rural, but by connecting rural identity with particular ways of knowing nature, the appreciation of impurity also marks out a life worth living, based on a different set of rationalities.<footnote label="41" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002456" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002457">Brian Wynne, &#x2018;Misunderstood misunderstanding: social identities and public uptake of science&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Public Understanding of Science</emphasis>, vol. 1, 1992, pp. 281&#x2013;304.</para></footnote></para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002458">It is not only a rural identity that is acquired through the consumption of unpasteurized milk, but also a local/community identity. Trust and the security provided by local social relations are central to these relationships. In this way, unpasteurized milk is an important actor in constituting and binding the community together and its consumption stakes out a claim to community membership. For example, the provision of the milk round by the Goswells is embedded in a concern to &#x2018;check up&#x2019; on the elderly residents to ensure they are well, share gossip and keep in regular contact with other villagers. This concern is shared by the villagers, who display immense loyalty to the Goswells, declaring that they would never go anywhere else to get their milk. This loyalty to community social relations is equally a loyalty to the (im)purity of unpasteurized milk. In fact, so strong are these loyalties that residents will develop alternative forms of behaviour to claim community membership through unpasteurized milk. One elderly local lady, whose doctor forbade her to consume the milk because of her ill health, boiled the milk to allow her to continue buying it. By contrast, one parent who had moved into the village was concerned about the health implications but bought it anyway:</para>

<blockquote xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002459">
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002460">I have Michael&#x2019;s milk. And I know when people have young children &#x2013; when I moved into the village they tended to have tummy bugs quite a lot and you worry with young children where it&#x2019;s coming from &#x2013; whether it&#x2019;s the water, the milk, the food. But you wouldn&#x2019;t stop the milk because you might sort of supplement it with milk from elsewhere and not give it to your children, but you probably wouldn&#x2019;t say so &#x2013; you certainly wouldn&#x2019;t stop it.</para></blockquote>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002461" role="fullOut">There are threats, though, to these heterogeneous relations. The arrival of <?page value="176"?>new villagers with different attitudes to nature and (im)purity threaten both the continued sale of the milk and the community itself. These new residents might initially be prepared to try it to break into the local community, but more often than not, the milk is deemed too risky, even if it does mean community membership is compromised: &#x2018;When we first got here we thought we&#x2019;d try it, but then our two children went down with these nasty tummy bugs so we stopped it straight away and haven&#x2019;t had it since.&#x2019;</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002462">These different attitudes lead to a fragmentation of community identities, defining the limits of community membership and the status of insiders/outsiders. Villagers who do not drink the milk are seen as outsiders and newcomers, as people who see nature through a purified lens and who cannot therefore be considered rural. Their reluctance to join in with this community of food highlights what to consumers appears as an anti-community ethic and they are blamed for the declining provision of village services and sales of unpasteurized milk. Perceptions of (im)purity provide the key to a divided community, controlling membership of communities and rendering claims to a rural identity elusive.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002466" role="fullOut">These accounts of the consumption of unpasteurized milk in Ash Dean tell a number of different stories. First, they demonstrate the range of heterogeneity at play in the construction of rural space. The Goswells&#x2019; milk round constructs a network of heterogeneous subjects and objects that give character to the space in which they are embedded, through for example the establishment of norms of behaviour. In this way, the heterogeneous relationships found within Ash Dean reflect the practice of rural differentiation.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002467">Second, tracing the heterogeneous networks that construct the rural extensive self demonstrates the renegotiation of concepts such as impurity. In Ash Dean, impurity comes not to be defined by official discourses of health and safety, but by the local community. In this way, the consumption of unpasteurized milk reveals how these hybrid forms of nature are central to the creation of an extensive self. Unlike the purified middle-class constructions of the countryside, the extensive selves in Ash Dean are qualitatively different. The relations villagers form with unpasteurized milk allow them to access and construct a distinct community and rural identity. To engage with the (im)pure heterogeneity associated with unpasteurized milk is to become a local or rural person. This attempt to &#x2018;centre the self&#x2019; on a rural identity is also related to a mistrust of scientific discourses of risk and resentment of those incomers whose decision not to participate in these community rituals erodes community identities. As a result, the construction of the extensive self and its relations to the heterogeneous objects and subjects of rurality reflects other forms of rural activism and defensive localism.<footnote label="42" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002468" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002469">Michael Woods, &#x2018;Deconstructing rural protest: the emergence of a new social movement&#x2019;, <emphasis role="italic">Journal of Rural Studies</emphasis>, vol. 19, no. 3, 2003, pp. 309&#x2013;25.</para></footnote></para>

However, what is important to villagers is that the relationships they make with nature are somehow precarious. Thus, while unpasteurized milk centres rural identities, it does so because of a culture of nature that values its own transformative agency. Residents talk, for example, about the transformative agency of unpasteurized milk and how the consumption of impurity can positively transform human health. Engaging with the challenges of nature, its agencies and its (im)purities is part and parcel of this rural identity. In this sense, it is not only a sense of security that this extensive self provides. In some senses, the insecurity afforded by nature&#x2019;s agencies and (im)purities seems to be an important factor in these relationships. Thus, while no one is eager to see these relationships fall apart, that nature has the potential to transform them is not lost on anyone. Living with the uncertainty of nature and its transformative agency is therefore what is so central to the Ash Dean extensive self. While social desires shape the selection of rural heterogeneity, the agencies of these heterogeneous subjects and objects are crucial in characterizing the extensive self. It is here, then, that we can see the co-production of rural community identity.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002471">In this chapter I have therefore sought to show how impurity can be central to notions of rurality and community. To appreciate the importance of impurity, though, it was necessary to journey through dualistic theory to the theoretical terrain of ANT to bring to life the &#x2018;missing masses&#x2019;. In following these heterogeneous materials into the extensive self, we have seen how impurity is constructed within heterogeneous relations and how some impure rural objects and subjects are vital to the construction of rural identity and rural community. Relationships with impurity come to co-produce rurality, at least in Ash Dean. Of course, this is only one heterogeneous extensive self, but it marks out a distinct difference to others, such as <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000672"><primary>Murdoch, Jonathan</primary></indexterm>Murdoch&#x2019;s analysis of <indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000106"><primary>Bell, Michael</primary></indexterm>Bell&#x2019;s &#x2018;<indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000194"><primary>Childerley</primary></indexterm>Childerley&#x2019;. There are likely to be others too, in which different heterogeneous ecologies construct and secure multiple rural community identities. Tracking the relationships made with heterogeneous subjects and objects across rural space might therefore be crucial to understanding the differentiation of the English countryside.</para>

The appearance of this food is strictly regulated, even for fresh fruit, vegetables and meat: signs of the organic origins of food (for example soil, blood) are banished and blemishes are not tolerated. There has been much recent academic interest, however, in so-called &#x2018;alternative food networks&#x2019; (AFN), in which consumers get at least some of their food directly from growers or producers. Such food, in contrast to supermarket food, often <emphasis role="italic">does</emphasis> retain the evidence of its production. In this chapter we discuss how participants in AFN feel about their food. We explore the ambiguous relationships that can exist between these food consumers and food that, unlike the hyper-clean products associated with contemporary supermarkets, bears the traces of the environment within which it was produced &#x2013; in particular, the soil or dirt in which vegetables are grown.</para>

It follows that supposedly &#x2018;dirty&#x2019; substances present on food, for example evidence of soil, manure or blood, can be doubly psychologically problematic. We must eat, yet in the modern era increasingly feel revulsion at this evidence of the origins of food. Supermarket consumers have increasingly got used to food that is heavily packaged &#x2013; individually plastic wrapped cucumbers or swedes, for example, or bloodless and anonymous pieces of meat. Thus, supermarkets have increasingly distanced food consumers from the earthy, dirty environmental conditions in which their food is produced. Yet, in response to a growing sense of unease with supermarket-dominated food supply systems, for many consumers there is, conversely, a desire actually to connect with the people, processes and places associated with their food, and for some this has meant buying into &#x2018;alternative&#x2019; food networks where food is sourced in ways that do less to conceal its origins, and where the dirt on food might attest to its production under what are regarded as more natural conditions, even though such dirt might still be experienced as a challenge to self-identity. So, in the AFN we have been studying, the relationships with dirt on food are in many cases actually affirmative of a set of positive differences between such food and &#x2018;conventionally&#x2019;-sourced food, while the unnatural, sanitized appearance of wrapped, processed foods becomes a cause for suspicion. It is this that we want to explore in a little more detail in this chapter.</para>

These relationships are usually associated with particular geographical locations and ethical frameworks that address a range of concerns including, for example, food transport, the use of agro-chemicals, human health, animal welfare, unfair trading practices and labour exploitation. A crucial feature that distinguishes these relationships from those of conventional food production and consumption is that there is an element of &#x2018;close connection&#x2019; between producers, consumers and food. This suggests some degree of consumer engagement with the production of food, ranging from direct knowledge of the producer, production methods or place of production, to actual participation in the growing of food.</para>

In depth interviews were conducted with participants in the different schemes, and we draw here on the ways in which they described their relationships with food that arrives in a more &#x2018;natural&#x2019;, dirty state.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002575" role="fullOut">For these respondents, the contrast between supermarket-driven relationships with nature and the relationships with nature that are part of their participation in AFN are clear: where evidence of the natural processes of growing food is erased in supermarkets, food from AFN that is dirty, imperfectly shaped and with evidence of what might conventionally be seen as the polluting presence of insects and other fauna, a set of positive associations between good food and a sort of earthy, rural naturalness is drawn, for example in seeing the production and rotting of food as part of a natural cycle. At the same time, notions of quality are redefined in different ways from those apparent in supermarkets. Rather than perfectly clean and <?page value="185"?><indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000249"><primary>community supported agriculture (CSA)</primary></indexterm>wrapped, identically sized and coloured vegetables and fruits, quality in AFN is defined in terms of the pleasure taken in the taste and more variable appearance of the food.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002579" role="fullOut">These comments suggest that what seems to be desired from participation in AFN is a knowledge of food and the conditions under which it is produced, which we might also understand as a sense of connectedness to the site and processes of food production that are literally carried to the consumer through the food and the &#x2018;dirty&#x2019; traces of nature that adhere to it.</para>

While soil, as a visible pollutant, was generally seen in positive terms, as shown above, invisible dirt or contaminants were much more problematic, and were directly associated with foods sourced from more conventional supermarket outlets. Indeed, it <?page value="187"?><indexterm class="singular" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0000001-9000058"><primary>alternative food networks (AFN)</primary></indexterm>was the anxieties surrounding these conventional foods that led the consumers to the alternative sources they used. For example, one farm shop consumer said that &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t want chemicals and crap in my food,&#x2019; and contrasted this with the hand-making of food sold in the farm shop. Again, it is worth mentioning the metaphorical use of another bodily waste, &#x2018;crap&#x2019;, which is used here to emphasize the anxiety felt about industrially processed food.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002605">Others expressed more widely the sense of anxiety that came from conventionally processed foods, showing how that anxiety could be associated with not knowing who had handled the food, where it came from, or where it had been. One farm shop consumer thus said that they washed all their fruit and vegetables, even pre-washed supermarket salad and vegetables, because &#x2018;I mean if nothing else it&#x2019;s been handled and may have little things landing in it. It&#x2019;s bound to because it&#x2019;s, you know, it&#x2019;s been in the world. So I wash it.&#x2019; Similarly, another commented:</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002608">So here the potential for pollution of food by unknown people and unknown processes &#x2018;out in the world&#x2019;, as the earlier comment suggested, is responsible for a sense of food anxiety, which is responded to by washing produce in an attempt to remove what is clearly felt to be the possibility or probability of a polluting presence. The fact that supermarket food is presented as sanitized, as cleaned and wrapped in plastic, then, far from allaying fears produces new sets of anxieties. As one final comment here suggests, it is &#x2018;the dirt you can&#x2019;t see you worry about&#x2019;.</para>

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002612" role="fullOut">When we started our investigations into these aspects of consumers&#x2019; relationships with their food we anticipated that there would be ambiguity in the discussions of the presence of soil and other evidence of growing conditions, which seemed to characterize food from the alternative sources in which we were interested. However, in fact we find that despite some minor irritation that food has to be scrubbed clean of attached soil, consumers who purchase food from AFN overwhelmingly see such dirt as attesting to certain key characteristics of the food: its &#x2018;naturalness&#x2019;, healthiness and wholesomeness, and the sense they get from it of connection to the people, places and processes involved in growing the food.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002613">In contrast, the hyperclean appearance and packaged nature of the food <?page value="188"?>from more conventional sources is regarded with suspicion. These standards of quality, which supermarkets have been able to define and which are reliant on the sanitized presentation of highly standardized food products, are seemingly being rejected by at least some consumers who favour an alternative set of quality indicators, such as taste, and a more or less direct sense of connectivity with the process of food production.</para>
<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002614">More broadly then, we might suggest that there is, implicitly, a moral framework or moral geography present in our consumers&#x2019; discussion of their foods. In this framework, food that is &#x2018;dirty&#x2019; is regarded not just as providing a better sensual eating experience, but as embodying &#x2018;better&#x2019; moral principles. These include, for example, a perception that organic production is better than conventional farming, that local production is better than food chains that transport products over great distances, that food that is in some way &#x2018;closer&#x2019; to nature and displays evidence of that closeness is better than food that is cleaned and wrapped, and that direct connections with the producers of food are better than food that comes from anonymous sources. Ironically, then, for some consumers, hyperclean supermarket food is contaminated by negative moral associations, and by the unknown-ness and invisibility of its provenance. In these cases, then, the increasingly sophisticated attempts by conventional retailers to mark foods with symbols of quality assurance<footnote label="22" xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002615" role="end-bk-note"><para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002616">Carol Morris and Craig Young, &#x2018;New geographies of agro-food chains: an analysis of UK quality assurance schemes&#x2019;, in Alex Hughes and Suzanne Reimer (eds) <emphasis role="italic">Geographies of Commodity Chains</emphasis> (London: Routledge, 2004) pp. 83&#x2013;101.</para></footnote> might be seen as simply something else that actually distances food from consumers, by establishing yet more centres of judgement and control, which are located in further anonymous places, while the actual traces of dirt that cling to foods from alternative sources act as more direct guarantees for these consumers of the quality and provenance of their foods.</para>

Academics, firefighters and motorcyclists were targeted to represent a range of relations to risks in food and daily activities.

<para xml:id="b-9780755694235-0002658" role="fullOut">Contamination is carried by agents called prions &#x2013; a new form of infectious dirt. Prions are neither bacterium nor virus, and cannot easily be killed by chemicals, heat or radiation because they have no DNA. Professor Stanley Prusiner won the 1997 Nobel Prize for identifying these protein molecules, which in their pathogenic form cause adjacent protein molecules to loop in a pattern that induces the Swiss cheese effect, hampering brain function and mobility until death. There is no cure for BSE and, because it can be passed from mother to calf, hundreds of thousands of cows have been destroyed in the UK and other countries. Prions&#x2019; mysterious resistance to what Douglas terms cleaning or purification, indicates that the surest path to purification of animals and humans is in exalting food ways unbesmirched by BSE &#x2013; alternative food networks promoting sustainable methods such as organic food.
