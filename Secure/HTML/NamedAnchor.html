        <h2 id="javacollection">What is a Java Collection Framework?</h2>

            <p>A Java collection framework provides an architecture to store and manipulate a group of objects. A Java collection framework includes the following:</p>

            <p>Interfaces<br>
                Classes<br>
                Algorithm</p>

        <h2 id="usecollection">Why use Java collection?</h2>
            <p>There are several benefits of using Java collections such as:</p>
            <p>Reducing the effort required to write the code by providing useful data structures and algorithms<br>
        Java collections provide high-performance and high-quality data structures and algorithms thereby increasing the speed and quality<br>
        Unrelated APIs can pass collection interfaces back and forth<br>
        Decreases extra effort required to learn, use, and design new API’s<br>
        Supports reusability of standard data structures and algorithms</p>

        <h2 id="frameworkcollection">Java Collection Framework Hierarchy</h2>    
            <p>As we have learned Java collection framework includes interfaces and classes. Now, let us see the Java collections framework hierarchy.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">BackToTop</a></p>

        <h2 id="interface">Java Collections : Interface</h2>
            <p>Iterator interface : Iterator is an interface that iterates the elements. It is used to traverse the list and modify the elements. Iterator interface has three methods which are mentioned below:</p>
            <p>public boolean hasNext() – This method returns true if the iterator has more elements.<br>
            public object next() – It returns the element and moves the cursor pointer to the next element.<br>
            public void remove() – This method removes the last elements returned by the iterator.</p>
            <p><a href="#top">BackToTop</a></p>

        <h2 id="list">Java collections: List</h2> 
                <p>A List is an ordered Collection of elements which may contain duplicates. It is an interface that extends the Collection interface. Lists are further classified into the following:</p>

                <p>ArrayList<br>
                    LinkedList<br>
                    Vectors</p>
                <p><a href="#top">BackToTop</a></p>

        <h2 id="queue">Java collections: Queue</h2>
                <p>Queue in Java follows a FIFO approach i.e. it orders the elements in First In First Out manner. In a queue, the first element is removed first and last element is removed in the end. Each basic method exists in two forms: one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a special value.</p>

        <h2 id="set">Java Collections: Sets</h2>
                <p>A Set refers to a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. It is mainly used to model the mathematical set abstraction. Set has its implementation in various classes such as HashSet, TreeSetand LinkedHashSet.</p>
